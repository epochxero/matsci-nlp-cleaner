10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.198,An improved tracking-differentiator filter based on Taylor's formula,"Abstract Because of the ability of tracking and filtering the reference signal (RS), and the ability of obtaining the generalized derivative of the RS, nonlinear tracking differentiators (NTDs) have been widely applied in many of the engineering fields. However, there are phase delays when applying NTDs. These phase delays will affect subsequent performance. In order to improve the accuracy of NTDs, a new phase compensation method based on Taylor's formula is proposed in this paper, which could reduce the phase delays significantly. Some simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",Apr-18," Keywords Tracking differentiator Filtering Phase delay Taylor's formula Compensation method 1 Introduction In many of the actual engineering projects, we usually encounter the requirements for extracting true signals of given signals with noise, these need filtering technologies. There are many filtering methods proposed by others, such as adaptive filter [1], the Kalman filter and its improving algorithms [2–4], and tracking-differentiator filter [5]. The most widely used tracking-differentiator is proposed by Han–Wang in [6]. It is a nonlinear tracking differentiator which can successfully track the input signals (ISs) and obtain the generalized derivatives of the ISs. Because of its rigid proof in mathematics and good effect of tracking for application in engineering, it has been also widely used in many other fields. The effectiveness has been confirmed by engineering practices [7]. To make such differentiator popular, the main idea of [6] and the corresponding control method, which called active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), was translated from Chinese into English in [8]. For the purpose of engineering applications, numerical analysis is essential to verify the proposed algorithm, so the discrete form of NTD (as DNTD) is necessary, which has been done by Han–Yuan in [9]. Han–Yuan used time zone method to determine the synthesis function of the second-order discrete optimal control system. It has been found that DNTD could not only track but also filter the input signals. Wu et al. [5] studied the filtering performance of DNTD, but they found that there existed some phase lags on the output results of DNTD. Wu et al. suggested a compensation method by predicting, and obtained a better outcome than that of the former DNTD. Laterly, Guo–Zhao [10] gave a rigorous proof under some additional conditions of NTD proposed by Han–Wang [6], which can be regarded as the theoretical support of the following analysis. After that, researchers proposed various improvements to obtain more accurate estimation and fewer phase lags, see [11–16]. Unfortunately, those results showed that phase lags still remained. Guo–Zhao had proved the weak convergence for the high-gain nonlinear differentiator based on finite-time stable systems [11]. Compared with the existing ones, its numerical experiment gave some good properties, such as fast tracking speed, accuracy, smooth, anti-chattering, less phase delays, and so on. However, such excellent method still has small phase delays, and the improved methods are always with more complex forms. So the finding of effective compensation method has stimulated much interest. Motivated by the previous works, we emphatically try to analyze the reason on the phase lags of DNTD. During this work, we intend to find a new phase compensation method which can reduce the phase lags for DNTD. Finally, we discover a new way on the compensation method by applying the idea of Taylor's formula, which has been analyzed by Wang in [17]. As a matter of fact, using Taylor's formula, Wang proposed a new idea to reconstruct signals which are with a sequence of observations. Inspired by Wang, we will apply Taylor's formula to do some compensation for the phase lags of DNTD. This paper is organized as follows. The problem is stated in Section 2, and the detailed compensation method based on Taylor's formula is provided in Section 3. Section 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method by numerical simulations. The comparison is carried out for noise free as well as noisy measurements. The comparative study suggests that, if the design parameters are chosen properly, the new compensation method outperforms the other methods. Readers can refer to [5,12]. The conclusions are given in Section 5. 2 The statement of the problem In this section, we will try to analyze the reason on the phase delays of NTDs first. And then we will demonstrate the existing problem by a simple example for DNTD introduced by Han–Yuan [9]. 2.1 The analysis on the reason of phase delays The essence of the tracking-differentiators in [6] for tracking the IS is carried out by constructing the dynamical systems of time optimal control systems which are with the proper tracking speeds. Therefore, there exists the fast or slow of tracking. That is to say, the phase delays are inevitable. So it is necessary to find a solution for compensating the phase delays. In the following, we will show the results of phase delays for a certain kind of NTDs. 2.2 The discrete form of nonlinear tracking differentiators For the purpose of engineering applications, especially for convenience of calculation, the DNTD, one of the implementation of NTD proposed by Han–Wang [6], is obtained by Han–Yuan [9]. For intuitionists, the DNTD is represented as follows: (1) x 1 ( k + 1 ) = x 1 ( k ) + hx 2 ( k ) , x 2 ( k + 1 ) = x 2 ( k ) - hrsat ( g ( k ) , δ ) , where h is the sample step, r is a​ parameter that could control the speed of the tracking. g(k) and δ are given as follows: (2) δ = hr , (3) g ( k ) = x 2 ( k ) − sign ( z ( k ) ) r ( h − 8 | z ( k ) | r + h 2 ) 2 , | z ( k ) | > δ 1 , x 2 ( k ) + z ( k ) h , | z ( k ) | ≤ δ 1 , where δ 1 = hδ, e ( k ) = x 1 ( k ) − v ( k ) , z(k) = e(k) + hx 2(k),​ and sat(·) is a saturate function (4) sat ( x , δ ) = sign ( x ) , | x | > δ , x δ , | x | ≤ δ , where r and h are design parameters. We can determine the optimal design ​parameters to obtain the desired results through amounts of simulation experiments. 2.3 The existed problem—the phase delays of DNTD A simple example is introduced here to illustrate the existed problem of phase delays. Example 1 Let v be an input signal without noise, i.e., (5) v = sin ( t ) . With the given design parameters, the tracking result and the differential result are shown in Fig. 1 respectively. The results in Fig. 1 indicate that DNTD works well on the layout of tracking and differential performance, but there exist significant phase delays. If we choose h = 0.01, r = 100 or r = 1000, the estimation will be more accurate which is shown in Fig. 2 . But after local amplification, there are still phase delays in both of them. The phenomenon of phase lags also exists in most of other improvement methods of NTD (see [11–16]). Because of phase lags, the accuracy of these differentiators is degraded no matter how the parameters are chosen. To get rid of the possible phase lags, we will give a compensation method based on Taylor's expansion in the next section. 3 The compensation method for pahse delays method based on Taylor's formula In this section, we will consider the method on the compensation for phase delays by using Taylor's formula. So, we introduce Taylor's formula briefly, and then describe our method based on Taylor's formula. 3.1 Taylor's formula and its inspiration Here we use Lagrange Taylor's expansion in the following of this paper. Assume that f is a function that satisfies the conditions of the Taylor's formula. If we know the value of f(x) at x, we can use above Taylor's formula to estimate the value of f(x) at x + Δx as follows: (6) f ( x + Δ x ) = f ( x ) + f ′ ( x ) 1 ! Δ x + f ″ ( x ) 2 ! ( Δ x ) 2 + ⋯ + f ( n ) ( x ) n ! ( Δ x ) n + f ( n + 1 ) ( ξ ) ( n + 1 ) ! ( Δ x ) n + 1 . Especially, for the function of time t, let y(t) be the true signal, v ( t ) be the observed signal which is often the true signal with noise, x 1 be the tracking or filter of v ( t ) , and x 2 be the differential signal of v ( t ) . In order to make the phase delays can be seen clearly, we set h = 0.1 and r = 1 in Example 1. The results with local enlarged are plotted in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3, the solid line is the input signal, because of the noise free measurement, it also denotes the true signal. The dash line is the tracking signal of the input signal. Because of the phase lags, the value of tracking signal x 1(t 1) does not reflect the real value y(t 1) at time t 1. As shown in Fig. 3, the tracking value x 1(t 1) equals the real value at time t 2, some time before t 1, i.e., the output signals of DNTD have lags with t 1 − t 2. With these findings and the inspiration of the Taylor's formula, we have the thought of doing compensations for the phase delays of DNTD. 3.2 The new compensation method of DNTD According to the considerations above, the basic compensation method is divided into the following steps: Firstly, we should deal with the input signal v ( t ) with the nth-order cascade of DNTD (suppose that every parameter r in (1) is the same) and get the output signal x 1i (t) (the tracking signal of v ( i ) ( t ) ) and the ith-order differential signal x 2i (t) from DNTD i at t. The relations of the signals can be seen from Fig. 4 , where x 1i is the filter and approximation of y (i−1), i = 1, 2, ⋯, n. Similarly, x 2i is the differential and approximation of y (i), i = 1, 2, ⋯, n. Secondly, according to Eq. (6), and the output signals of DNTD have lags with time t 1 − t 2, we can obtain the compensating signal which is also the approximate value y ˆ ( t 1 ) of the real value y(t 1) as follows: (7) y ˆ ( t 1 ) = y ( t 2 ) + y ′ ( t 2 ) 1 ! ( t 1 − t 2 ) + y ″ ( t 2 ) 2 ! ( t 1 − t 2 ) 2 + ⋯ + y ( n ) ( t 2 ) n ! ( t 1 − t 2 ) n + y ( n + 1 ) ( ξ ) ( n + 1 ) ! ( t 1 − t 2 ) n + 1 . That is to say, we could use the Taylor's expansion at t 2 to approximate y(t 1). But with the phase lags, as shown in Fig. 3, x 1(t 1) equals y(t 2). So if we know the lag time Δt = t 1 − t 2 = r F h accurately (where r F is the compensated step), we could compensate the delay very well. In this paper, we set r t , r d as compensated steps for tracking and differential respectively. The compensated steps are design parameters, which should be chosen properly according to the values of r (design parameter in DNTD) and h (sample time). Then, Eq. (7) is changed into the following form: (8) y ˆ ( t 1 ) = x 11 ( t 1 ) + x 12 ( t 1 ) 1 ! ( t 1 − t 2 ) + x 13 ( t 1 ) 2 ! ( t 1 − t 2 ) 2 + ⋯ + x 1 n ( t 1 ) n ! ( t 1 − t 2 ) n . Finally, based on the analysis above, we use Eq. (8) as our suggested compensation method. This compensation method,​ based on Taylor's formula,​ is ​not only with a simple form, but also works well for signals with or without noises. The performance can be seen through the numerical simulations in next section. Notice that the compensation method in [5] is with the following form: (9) y ˆ ( t 1 ) = x 11 ( t 1 ) + r W hx 12 , where r W means the compensated step. In order to compare the results, we set the same compensated step, i.e., r W  = r F . So the method of [5] also can be considered as the first-order expansion of Taylor's formula, and it can be regarded as a specific form of our suggested method. As to the range of estimating error with our proposed method, it can be measured by the Lagrange remainder R n (x) in Taylor's formula. We assume that M is the upper bound of |f (n+1)(ξ)| in [x, x 0] or in [x 0, x]. Then (10) R n ( x ) ≤ M ( n + 1 ) ! | x − x 0 | n + 1 . It should be mentioned that Feng–Li [12] introduced two special high-gain tracking differentiators which are also based on the Taylor's expansion, but these methods are different. The difference is that we use Taylor's formula for the compensation of DNTD, while Feng–Li uses Taylor's formula in the tracking-differentiator. Our method is simpler than others, and it can also be used in other improved tracking differentiators where phase delays exist. In the next section, we will provide several numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 4 Numerical simulations In this section, several numerical simulations for different cases of signals are presented to illustrate the efficiency of our method. For simplicity, we first introduce some notations. DNTD denotes the discrete nonlinear tracking differentiator. DNTDT1 represents the compensation method based on the first-order Taylor's formula (which can also be seen as the extension of the compensation method in [5]). DNTDT2 means the compensation method based on the second-order Taylor's formula. From [12], TD1 signifies the tracking-differentiator which named TD1 in [12]. We will carry out our simulations by choosing the proper parameter r, the sample time h and the compensated steps r t , r d respectively. In the following, suppose that Error is the difference between the true signal and the estimated signal. 4.1 Case for noise free signals In this section, we first give the following example. Example 2 Consider an observation v ( t ) which is with the form of the sinusoidal function, i.e. (11) v ( t ) = sin ( 2 t ) . By straightforward calculation, we obtain v ′ ( t ) = 2 cos ( 2 t ) , so we can judge the results of compensation by using the reference value v ′ ( t ) of differential signal. When we choose h = 0.01, r = 1000, r t  = 2.06, r d  = 1.5, and the initial state of DNTD to be (0, 0), the simulation results are shown below. Fig. 5 represents the tracking results, and Fig. 6 indicates the differential results. From Fig. 5, we know that DNTDT1 and DNTDT2 could compensate phase delays and improve tracking accuracy significantly, which can be seen clearly in Fig. 5(b). What's more, it is easy to see that the tracking error of DNTDT2 is less than that of DNTDT1. That is to say, DNTDT2 performs better than DNTDT1 in this case. From Fig. 6, we can also obtain the same conclusion. These results indicate that, the proposed compensation methods based on Taylor's formula could decrease phase delays in DNTD observably when we deal with noise free signal. In addition, DNTDT2 works better than DNTDT1, which indicates that compensation method based Taylor's formula outperform the method proposed by Wu et al. [5]. 4.2 Case for noisy signals Example 3 Consider an observation v ( t ) which is the sinusoidal function with white noise η t . (12) v ( t ) = sin ( 2 t ) + 0.0001 η t . Here we suppose that η t obeys the standard normal distribution. We also use the real signal, y(t) = sin(2t), and the real deviative of y(t), y′(t) = 2 cos(2t), to judge the compensation effect. Let h = 0.01, r = 200, r t  = 2.0, r d  = 1.5, and the initial value in DNTD to be (0, 0). The results on filtering, differential and their errors are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 respectively. Figs. 7(b) and 8(b) indicate that both results from DNTDT1 and DNTDT2 based on Taylor's expansion are superior than the results only from DNTD. It means that the new compensation method can also process noisy signals very well. To summarize, Examples 2 and 3 have verified the efficiency of our proposed compensation method. They also show DNTDT2 works better than DNTDT1 in most cases. So in the next example, DNTDT2 is chosen for comparison with TD1. Example 4 In this example, v ( t ) is defined the same as that in Example 3. For given ε > 0, following [12], we set ε = 0.1, then results of TD1 will be determined. If sample time h = 0.01, by trial and error, the design parameters are chosen as: r = 185, r t  = 2, r d  = 1.5. The initial value in DNTD is (0, 0). Then the simulation results are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 respectively. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, we can obtain more efficiency results on tracking and differential than those of TD1 if the design parameters are chosen properly. 5 Conclusions In this paper, a new compensation method based on Taylor's formula for DNTD has been presented. We discuss the phase lags phenomenon which often occurs in DNTD, and propose a compensating method to improve DNTD's tracking, filtering and differential performance. Compared with the compensation method of Wu et al. [5] and TD1 in [12], the method proposed in this paper improves the tracking accuracy greatly, and obtains a more accurate approximation for differential signals. From the simulations, we could obtain better approximate results if we adjust the design parameters properly. So the adjustment of the design parameters is very important, and this is the key issue we want to consider in the future. "," [1] Z. Zhu X. Gao L.L.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.089,Comparative study of electronic and optical properties of graphene and germanene: DFT study,"Abstract We have performed a first-principle study of the electronic and optical properties of optimized structure of germanene and graphene by means of density functional theory, using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method based to Gradient Generazed approximation (GGA). Moreover, the enhanced absorption coefficient, reflectivity and refraction index are also study in both directions. In general, the calculated results indicate that the graphene and germanene are similar electronic structure with zero band gap at K point, further the absorption coefficient and reflectivity of germanene is higher in visible light than graphene; germanene holds great potential solar cell applications.",Apr-18," Keywords Graphene germanene Superlattices Electronic properties Band gap engineering 1 Introduction Graphene has attracted great interest recently due to its exceptional electronic properties and potential application in nanotechnologies [1,2]. Graphene describes near the Dirac points linear dispersion relation with a Fermi velocity of about 106 m s − 1. Already in the first experimental studies obtained a high charge carrier motilities from 15 000 cm2 (V s) −1 for graphene on SiO2 substrate to 20,000 cm2 (V s) −1 for graphene suspended [1]. After discovery of graphene drive researches in nanomaterial on 2D materials, especially on elemental ones. A novel two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene after the successful synthesis of silicene in 2012 [3]. In 2014 several research groups have reported the growth of germanene, a new member of the graphene family. Germanene shares very peculiar and interesting electronics properties with silicene and graphene. The method for synthesising germanene is similar to silicene and graphene is to deposit a layer of germanium atoms onto a substrate in high temperature and in an utra-high vacuum. The germanene a two-dimensional germanium layer result by deposition of germanium onto the Au (111) surface at 200 °C similarly to the formation of silicene on Ag (111), this result has been proved experimentally with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and DFT calculation [4]. By using the density functional theory (DFT) buckled hexagonal sheets of germanium are more stable than their planar arrangements [5]. The spin-orbit gap in germanene is around 24 meV is much larger than in graphene inferior to 0.05 meV, Because of low buckled structure and greater spin orbit coupling which makes germanene the ideal candidate to exhibit the quantum spin Hall effect at experimentally accessible temperatures [6]. Germanene has many aspects very similar to graphene, but in contrast to the planar graphene lattice, the germanene honeycomb lattice is buckled and composed of two vertically displaced sublattices. Since the fact that both of C and Ge atoms have four electrons in the valence band, which makes the properties of germanene very similar to those of graphene. Furthermore, compared to graphene, germanene is more preferable for the present novel functional electronic devices such as room temperature field effect transistors [7]. Different from sp2 hybridization that is energetically more favorable for C atoms in graphene, germanene is contributed by sp2 and sp3 hybridization leading to slightly buckled structure. The electronic and optical properties of germanene have been determined from ab initio calculations it is quite similar to graphene a zero band-gap semi metallic, and a linear dispersion near to K and K' points and massless particles of their charge carriers [8,9]. However, the gapless characteristic of germanene limits its utilizations in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices [10]. In order to compare graphene and germanene electronic and optical proprieties. The electronics and optical of germanene has been investigated by attaching a hydrogen atom to each germanium atom named germanane; germanane has a direct average band gap of 3.2 eV [11]. In this manuscript, we compare the electronic and optical proprieties of graphene and germanene structures by using DFT calculation with GGA approximation. 2 Computational details Structural optimization and calculations were performed using DFT based ab-initio approach implemented in provided by Wien2k [12]. The WIEN2K computational code allows performing electronic and optical structure calculations of solids using density functional theory. It is based on the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) + lo method, one of the most accurate schemes for band structure calculations. the LAPW + lo approach, each unit cell is divided into two regions: the muffin tin sphere around each atom and the interstitial region outside the spheres [13,14]. The radii of the non-over lapping muffin tin spheres are chosen as Rc = 1.13 a.u. In our calculations, the DFT step is carried on using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [15]. A vacuum layer of 20 A was used in the direction normal to the interface, representing the isolated slab boundary condition. The k-point was set to 500 for the structural optimizations and for the electrical properties calculations. The optical properties of a material are directly connected to the complex dielectric function: (1) ε ω = ε 1 ω + i ε 2 ω The complex dielectric tensor was calculated, in this program, according to the well-known relations [16]. (2) ε 2 ( ω ) = 4 π 2 e 2 m 2 ω 2 ∑ i j ∫ 〈 i , M , j 〉 2 f i ( 1 - f i ) δ ( E f - E i - ω ) d 3 k Where M is the dipole matrix, i and j are the initial and final states, respectively, f i is, the distribution of fermi as a function of the state and E i is the energy of an electron in the i-th state with a wave vector k. ε 1 ω Is the real part of the dielectric function and can be obtained from ε 2 ω using the Kramers–Kronig transformation [16]: (3) ε 1 ω = 1 + 2 π p ∫ 0 ∞ ω ' ε 2 ω ' d ω ' ω ' 2 - ω 2 With ω and p are respectively the frequency and principal value, respectively. The coefficient of absorption alpha is given by [17]: (4) α ω = 2 ω c ε 1 2 ω + ε 2 2 ω - ε 1 ω 1 2 with c is velocity of light in free space The optical reflectivity R ω spectra derived from the Fresnel’s formula for normal incidence [17]: (5) R ω = ε ω - 1 ε ω + 1 2 The variation of the refractive index n (ω) versus the energy or wavelengths may be calculated using the formula: (6) n ω = ε 1 2 ω + ε 2 2 ω + ε 1 ω 2 1 2 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Electronic propriety The geometric structures of the graphene and germanene are shown in Fig. 1 . After full optimization, The Fig. 1(c) shows a plane structure of the side view of graphene, Fig. 1(d) show the bulk structure of the side view germanene, the bulked distance Δ is 0.75 Å. We have calculated the total and partial DOS of graphene and germanene. It has shown that is graphene and germanene structure are similar, with gapless semimetal and sp2 hybridization, which is shown respectively in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). As shown in Fig. 2(a) the major contribution is provided by 2p-states of carbon atom, with a small contribution from 2s-states of carbon. A very significant peak at around 1.78 eV in valence region and at −2.48 eV valence region, which mainly due to contribution of 2p states of carbon. Fig. 2(b) of germanene shows significant peak at around 4.65 eV in the valence region and −1.78 eV in the conduction region due to the contribution of 2p states of germanium atom. Fig. 3 show the band structure of graphene and germanene show all metallic in character giving zero gap with linear dispersion at the K point. Although our result is in agree with experimental Refs. [18,19]. At low values of energy, the electrons behave like massless relativistic particles, described by the Dirac-fermion system. Since graphene is sp2 hybridized, the coupling between the nearest neighbor atoms is very strong and electrons can easily tunnel from one atom to another, which may explain the larger velocities of electrons in graphene compared to germanene 3.2 Optical properties The plots for the absorption coefficient for graphene in comparison to germanene is shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The absorption coefficient of graphene in (xx direction) shows peaks at about λ = 283 nm. Whereas germanene the peak appears in visible region indicating the absorption in visible region more than graphene. The absorption coefficient for the perpendicular polarization to graphene is nearly zero. The absorption coefficient of germanene in (zz direction), two peaks appear at wavelengths λ = 200 nm and λ = 300 nm and goes on decreasing visible light (Fig. 4 ). The Fig. 5 gives the comparison of reflectivity for graphene and germanene sheet for both directions of electric field using Eq. (4). The reflectivity of graphene in (xx direction) is of 12% at the wavelength λ = 283 nm, in the range of visible light the peak of reflectivity is 7.8% at the wavelength λ = 560 nm. Further, the reflectivity of germanene is higher than graphene; the peak is 28.3% at the wavelength 403 nm. In (zz direction), reflectivity of graphene is less than germanene (Fig. 6 ). The value of static refraction index (value of refraction index at zero energy) in case of parallel polarization 1.95 for graphene and minimum at energy of 5.2 eV for germanene static refraction index 3.3 and minimum at 6.5 eV as shown in figure. While in case of perpendicular polarization, the static refraction index of graphene is 1.32 and 1.12 for germanene. Refraction index is minimum at energy of 8.9 eV for graphene and 12.4 eV for germanene. 4 Conclusions We have compared the electronic and optical of graphene and germanene structure, with GGA approach. The optical properties are different in parallel and perpendicular electric field direction, so the graphene and germanene are anisotropic materials. In addition, the band gap is similar and the optical properties (absorption, reflectivity and refraction index) of germanene is more important than graphene structure. Germanene absorption is higher in visible light than graphene; that holds great potential solar cell applications. "," [1] S.V.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.058,An accurate approach for the computation of polar harmonic transforms,"Abstract Polar Harmonic Transforms (PHTs) can be used as a feature extraction technique by exploiting their orthogonal basis that generate a set of rotation invariant features. PHTs have distinct traits as compared with other transforms and moments. This is because of their less redundant information. Applied to digital images polar harmonic transforms suffer from various numerical and statistical errors. In this paper a computational framework based on two different numerical integration schemes which reduce the numerical errors in the computation of the transforms. Extensive experiments are carried out in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed technique in face recognition problem. Two standard face databases are employed, i.e., ORL and JAFFE, which contain images with different variations. Furthermore, the rotation invariant trait of the proposed approach is evaluated using different rotation angles. The proposed approach attenuates the numerical errors as well as provides numerical stability to PHTs of high orders.",Apr-18," Keywords Radial moments Image descriptors Invariance Accuracy Fast calculation Face description and recognition 1 Introduction Moments and transforms are known to be excellent image descriptors. Through image moments and transforms we can easily found many simple properties of image which include area (or total intensity), its centroid, and information about its orientation symmetry structure. Moments and transforms have a wide range of applications in image analysis, such as, invariant pattern or object recognition, image reconstruction, content-based image retrieval, watermarking, data-hiding, optical character recognition, pattern classification, face recognition, map matching, palm print verification and edge detection. The capability of image moments and transforms of feature representation have been widely used in object identification techniques in several areas of computer vision and robotics. Information about the different types of geometrical features of the image is provided by the set of moments and transforms computed from digital image. Moreover, the moment and transform descriptor are simple to use and can be designed to provide fast, efficient and versatile system to calculate numerical features for many applications. The accuracy of pattern recognition process can be enhanced by using the appropriate feature extraction method. One of the oldest moment and transform based shape descriptors, which are used to generate a set of invariants that have been used in many pattern recognition processes, are Geometric moments (GMs). The major disadvantage of GMs is that their information redundancy is very high. On the other hand, orthogonal radial moments and transforms are free from these drawbacks because each moment and transform describes distinct information of an image. Among the orthogonal radial moments, Zernike moments (ZMs), Pseudo Zernike moments (PZMs) and orthogonal Fourier Mellin moments (OFMMs) are generally used to represent an image with minimum amount of information redundancy. Orthogonal transforms include polar harmonic transforms (PHTs). PHTs consist of polar complex exponential transforms (PCETs), polar cosine transforms (PCTs) and polar sine transforms (PSTs). The main advantage of PHTs is low computational complexity over ZMs, PZMs. and OFMMs. Transformations are numerically instable at low frequency transformation and numerically stable at high frequency of transforms. The radial function of moments (ZMs, PZMs, OFMMs) are polynomial in r, whereas the radial function of transforms are harmonic in nature, i.e., they are basic waves. Moment invariant was first introduced by Hu [1] in 1962. He employed the results of the theory of algebraic invariants and derived his seven famous invariants to rotation of 2-D objects. At that time, hundreds of papers have been devoted to various improvements, extensions and generalizations of moment invariants and also to their use in many areas of application. Moment invariants have become one of the most important and most frequently used shape descriptors. Even though they suffer from certain intrinsic limitations, which prevent direct utilization for occluded object recognition, they frequently serve as first choice descriptors and as a reference method for evaluating the performance of other shape descriptors. Despite a tremendous effort and huge number of published papers, many open problems remain to be resolved. Teague [2] present orthogonal Zernike moments to image analysis, ZMs possess many useful characteristics as they provide good quality of image representation due to less sensitive to noise. Due to the orthogonal property ZMs possess minimum information redundancy as they belong to a set of orthogonal and complete polynomials defined inside a unit circle. They are found to be robust to image noise. These features of ZMs, are very useful in image description, but they also suffer from various errors which affect their accuracy. Bhatia and wolf [3] introduce class of circular orthogonal moments called Pseudo Zernike moments (PZMs), which exhibit similar properties to ZMs. Another important orthogonal rotation invariant moment known as OFMMs was first introduced by Sheng and Shen [4]. Apart from the characteristics of moments they suffer from various errors which affect their accuracy as well immunity to noise. The two major errors which arise in moment computation are geometric error and numerical integration error. These errors are also found in all ORIMs. The researchers observed that geometric error basically arises when a rectangular or square image is mapped geometrically inside the unit circle. This mapping allows only those pixels into computation of moments whose center fall inside the unit circle while discard the rest. As a result, the total pixel area used for the moment computation becomes unequal to the area of the circular region. The second error, that is, numerical integration error is caused when double integration in moment computation is approximated by zeroth order summation. Many algorithms have been developed till now for the removal of these errors. In term of noise sensitivity OFMMS have better performance than ZMs and PZMs for small images. Ping and Sheng [5] introduced Chebyshev-Fourier moments (CHFMS). Polar harmonic transforms (PHTs) are recently proposed by Yap et al. [6], which are similar to ORIMs. They observe that PHTs can be used to generate rotation-invariant features. The computation of PHTs kernel function is simple as compare to ZMs and PZMs. PHTs are numerical stable so numerical stability issue is nonexistent. The authors compared the kernel generation complexibility of PHTs with popular ZMs and PZMs. They observed that kernel generation is much less complex as compare to ZMs and PZMs. PHTs are one of such image descriptors, which are robust to image noise, invariant with respect to rotation, and after certain geometric transformations they can be made scaling and translation invariant [7]. The computation complexity of PHTs is also very low as compared to ORIMs [8]. Due to the orthogonal property, PHTs exhibit many useful characteristics such as they possess minimum information redundancy and immunity to noise. PHTs are popular with various applications such as Fingerprint classification [9], Pattern recognition [10], Character recognition, Image reconstruction [11], Image retrieval, Image data mining, face recognition [12] Texture classification, Corneal surface modeling, Biomedical imaging such as MRI or PET cans(using the 3D formulation), etc. [13,14]. The accuracy of these applications depends on the accuracy of the moment values. Therefore, the accurate computation of transforms is the major task for these applications. PHTs suffer from various errors. These errors affect the accuracy of results. Many approaches have been proposed to remove these errors till now, which reduced the errors but not completely. We propose two novel methods for the accurate computation of PHTs. The first method is based on grid division method and second method developed using wavelet integration. In the first approach, when we take average value of all sub regions, the errors involved tend to reduce simultaneously. In this approach we avoid all those sub regions whose center falls outside the circle. The angular polynomials of transforms are computed recursively, which takes less time as compare to direct method. Another important advantage of using this method is that its calculations are simple as compare to previous methods. This method gives accurate results as the pixels are divided into sub regions which means every small region will be covered whose center falls inside the circle. For high order transforms, as the reconstruction error decreases in reconstructed images, the distortion present at the center of circle also decreases and hence accurate reconstructed image is obtained. The method also increases the speed of computation which is affected by computation of angular polynomials. The second method using wavelet integration is also effective technique for the computation of polar harmonic transforms. The PHTs have well established applications in face recognition problems. To strengthen our claim of accuracy some experiments are performed on different face databases. The experiments reveal that the proposed methods give high recognition rate as compared to the existing approaches. The rest of the presented paper is ordered as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of concept of the PHTs, while their computational framework is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presented detailed of the experiments. Conclusions are presented in Section 5. 2 Polar harmonic transforms (PHTs) The kernel functions of polar complex exponential transform (PCET), polar cosine transform (PCT) and polar sine transform (PST) define a set of orthogonal complex functions defined inside a unit circle over the polar coordinate space. The kernel function for each transform can be decomposed into radial and circular components. For an image function f ( r , θ ) expressed in the polar coordinates (r), the PHTs of order p with repetition q can be defined as follows: (1) M p q = λ ∫ 0 2 π ∫ 0 1 f ( r , θ ) H p q * ( r , θ ) r d r d θ , where H p q * ( r , θ ) is the complex conjugate of the basis function H p q ( r , θ ) . The generic form of H p q ( r , θ ) is following (2) H p q ( r , θ ) = R p ( r ) e j q θ , where R p ( r ) is the radially defined kernel function. For the considered class of harmonic transforms the function R p ( r ) is defined as follows (3) R p ( r ) = e i 2 π p r 2 F o r t h e P C E T t r a n s f o r m , (4) R p ( r ) = cos ( π p r 2 ) F o r t h e P C T t r a n s f o r m , (5) R p ( r ) = sin ( π p r 2 ) F o r t h e P S T t r a n s f o r m , The set of admissible values of (p, q) for the aforementioned transforms are different and they take the following values (6) { | p | ≥ 0 , | q | ≥ 0 a n d λ = 1 π , P C E T p ≥ 0 , | q | ≥ 0 a n d λ = 1 π i f p = 0 , λ = 2 π i f p ≠ 0 , P C T p ≥ 1 , | q | ≥ 0 a n d λ = 2 π , P S T Since the integration in Eq. (1) does not have an analytical solution for N × N image, its zeroth order approximation, given below, is normally used (7) M p q = λ ∑ i = 0 x i 2 + y k 2 ≤ 1 N − 1 ∑ k = 0 N − 1 f ( x i , y k ) H p q * ( x , i y k ) Δ x i Δ y k where (8) x i = 2 i + 1 − N D , y k = 2 k + 1 − N D , i , k = 0 , 1 , ... , N − 1 and Δ x i = Δ y k = 2 D For inner circle mapping D = N and for outer circle D = N √ 2 . The image function is reconstructed by using inverse transforms. The function reconstruction for PHTs are given as (9) f ˆ ( x i , y k ) = ∑ p = p min p max ∑ q = q min q max M p q H p q ( x i , y k ) , i , k = 0 , 1 , ... , N − 1 where p min , p max , q min , q max are the respective minimum and maximum values of PHTs, orders and repetitions as mentioned in Eq. (1). The closeness of the original image function f ( x , y ) with the reconstructed image function f ˆ ( x , y ) refers to the capability of the method to translate an image in a high compact manner. The closeness is measured by fidelity criterion which can be expressed as a mean square reconstruction error (MSRE) represented by ε which can be defined as follows: (10) ε = ∑ i = 0 N − 1 ∑ k = 0 N − 1 ( f ( x i , y k ) − f ˆ ( x i , y k ) ) 2 ∑ i = 0 N − 1 ∑ k = 0 N − 1 f 2 ( x i , y k ) The approximation of Eq. (1) represented by Eq. (7), is computationally more suitable for a square image. This approximation generates two kinds of errors, which are numerical integration error and geometric error. The reason behind numerical integration error existing is the integration using summation which generates zeroth order approximation. Fig. 1 (a) represent the square image contained in outer circle unite. Geometric error arises exists because of using the condition x i 2 + y k 2 ≤ 1 . This condition permits the pixels whose centers included in unit circle to take part in computation. While the pixels do not satisfy the above condition are discarded. Therefore, mapping from the square domain into the circular domain is not achieved perfectly, which leads to approximates the circular boundary of the unit circle in a zig-zag pattern as seen in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c). Fig. 1(b) shows an 8 × 8 image and Fig. 1(c) shows the approximated circular disk utilized in the traditional methods. 3 Framework used for PHTs computation 3.1 Grid division We rewrite the Eq. (1) for the purpose of accurate computation using the division of pixels into sub regions as follows: (11) M p q = λ ∑ i = 0 x i 2 + y k 2 ≤ 1 N − 1 ∑ k = 0 N − 1 f ( x i , y k ) h p q , i k where (12) h p q , i k = ∫ a i a i + 1 ∫ b k b k + 1 H p q * ( x , y ) d x d y Where a i = 2 i − N D , b k = 2 k − N D , i , k = 0 , 1 , ... , N The integration of the kernel function given in Eq. (12) can be approximated by using the division of the pixel [ a i , a i + 1 ] , [ b k , b k + 1 ] into n × n sub regions with equal weights. The discrete approximation of Eq. (11) using grid division is given by, M ˆ p q = λ D 2 ∑ i = 0 N − 1 ∑ k = 0 N − 1 f ( x i , y k ) ∑ l = 1 n ∑ m = 1 n w l w m v * p q t l + 2 i + 1 − N N , t m + 2 k + 1 − N N (13) t l + 2 i + 1 − N N 2 + t m + 2 k + 1 − N N 2 ≤ 1 where w l = w m = 2 / n , and t l is the center point of the sub grid. For example t 1 = 1 when n = 1 , t 1 = − 1 / 2 , t 2 = 1 / 2 when n = 2 , t 1 = − 2 / 3 , t 2 = 0 , t 3 = 2 / 3 when n = 3 , and t 1 = − 3 / 4 , t 2 = − 1 / 4 , t 3 = 1 / 4 , t 4 = 3 / 4 when n = 4 and so on. The computation of transforms includes only those pixels and sub regions whose center falls inside the circle. The recursive method is used for the computation of angular polynomials which also enhances the speed of calculations. If we divide each pixel into 3 × 3 sub regions, i.e., n = 3, then pixel is divided into 9 parts. Similarly, if we divide each pixel into 5 × 5 sub regions, i.e., n = 5, then pixel is divided into 25 parts. In the experimental section we have used n = 5. This method is motivated by the research of Pawlak [15] and Wang and Liao [16]. 3.2 Wavelet integration Let f x be an 1-D function, then its Wavelet numerical integration in the interval a , b is given by [17] (14) ∫ a b f x d x ≅ ( b - a ) 2 T ∑ l = 1 2 T f a + b - a ( l - 0.5 ) 2 T where T = 2 j and j = 0,1 … … J . The integer j indicates the level of the wavelet and the maximum level of resolution is the integer J . In the proposed method we use j = 2 , j = 3 for the computational efficiency. The 2-D formulation of the numerical integration of f x , y is expressed as (15) ∫ a b ∫ c d f x , y d x d y ≅ b - a ( d - c ) 4 T 2 ∑ l = 1 2 T ∑ h = 1 2 T f a + b - a ( l - 0.5 ) 2 T , c + d - c ( h - 0.5 ) 2 T We now accurately compute the PHTs by resorting to Wavelet numerical integration of the double integration given in Eq. (11) (16) M ˆ p q = λ D 2 ∑ l = 1 2 T ∑ h = 1 2 T ( ∑ i = 0 N - 1 ∑ k = 0 N - 1 f ( x i , y k ) v p q * ( ( 2 i T - N T + l - 0.5 D T ) , ( 2 k T - N T + h - 0.5 D T ) ) ) (17) w h e r e ( 2 i T - N T + l - 0.5 D T ) 2 + ( 2 k T - N T + h - 0.5 D T ) 2 ≤ 1 The constraint given in Eq. (17) is an important over the constraint x i 2 + y k 2 ≤ 1 used zeroth order approximation for inscribe circular disk. This constraint also allows those grids to take part in computation whose centres fall outside the circle. The radial polynomials and angular polynomials are computed recursively using the method given by Singh and Kaur [15]. 4 Experimental Analysis All algorithms in the experimental phase are carried out in Microsoft VC++6.0 under windows environments on a PC has 3 GB memory with 3.0 GHz CPU. The experiments are used to assess the accuracy performance of the proposed approach under the following issues 1. The reconstruction capability of the transforms. 2. The effective of the proposed technique under face recognition applications. 4.1 The face databases used in the experiments a) ORL database ORL database [18] included 400 face images related to 40 subjects. There are 10 different facial sample assigned for each subject. Each image of this database with 256 gray levels and size 92 × 112 pixels. The face images of this database contain different variations such as: facial expression (close/open eyes, smiling/ not smiling), facial details (with glasses/without glasses), illumination, and pose of slight tilt/yaw upto ± 20°. The face images in this database were taken against a dark homogeneous background. b) JAFFE database JAFFE database [19] consist of 213 face images distributed on ten Japanese female subjects. Each subject has seven kinds of facial expression which are sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral, happiness, and anger. There are two-four samples for each facial expression per subject. Figs. 2–4 show some subjects of the database. 4.2 Reconstruction aspects For our experiment, we use 64 × 64 Lena image due to its contrast gray value. Different method under different value of pmax(moment order = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70) using PCTs and PSTs for both inner and outer circle mapping are used to assess the accuracy of the proposed method under image reconstruction aspect. For reconstruction aspects we have given results for PCTs and PSTs. The performance of the proposed methods is same for PCETs also. The reconstructed images gained by using the proposed technique are compared with direct method, Gaussian numerical integration method [7]. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 shows the original 64 × 64 Lena image and it’s reconstructed image using the direct method and proposed method respectively. Now in Fig. 6 column 2 shows the reconstructed image using direct method. Results are gained by estimating PHTs under zeroth order approximation. Increasing moment order pmax leads to increasing the reconstruction error. MSRE is low at pmax = 20. After pmax > 20 the MSRE is increasing in direct method column. The column 3 in Fig. 6, shows the reconstructed image resulted by using Gaussian 5 × 5 numerical integration method [7]. The results of column 3 are improved as compare to direct method. MSRE is decreases with increase in pmax ≤ 50, after pmax > 50 the value of MSRE little increases. Columns 4, 5 and 6 shows the reconstruction image results of our proposed methods. The numerical stability trend of PCTs can be observed from Fig. 7 . We can clearly see from this figure that the proposed methods outperform the traditional approach in terms of the stability. Similarly, now we will analysis the experimental details of the reconstruction image of PSTs under inner circle. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed technique is compared with the accuracy of direct method and Gaussian 5 × 5 numerical integration method. Fig. 8 shows the results of image reconstruct error using PSTs for inner circle. Image is reconstructed using different techniques under various orders of moments, column 2 shows the results of direct method, direct method stable up to pmax = 30 after this image is totally destroyed. In column 3 we can clearly seen the better results, in which we arrange the order moments in ascending form, the reconstructed error is decreases which leads to reduce the white spots. Columns 4, 5, 6, shows the results of our proposed methods. We can clearly seen from Fig. 9 that our proposed method provides better stability at higher order moments as compare to direct method and similar to Gaussian 5 × 5 numerical integration error. Our proposed method gives better quality of reconstructed image than other methods. 4.3 Face recognition using proposed approach In order to assess and compare the recognition accuracy of the proposed methods in face recognition application experiments have been carried out over two standard face databases, namely, JAFFE and ORL which contain different variations using PCTs. The experiments are performed for direct method, 5 × 5 Gaussian integration, n = 5 grid division method and j = 3 for wavelet integration method. The dataset of JAFFE database is constricted by randomly selecting one face image from each of the basic seven expression groups (anger, disgust, happiness, neutral, fear, sadness, surprise) of each subject for training and remaining all for testing, i.e., the total number of training face images is 70, while it is 143 for testing out of a total of 213 images. The dataset of ORL database is constructed by randomly selecting five random images for training and rest five images are used for test for each subject in ORL database. Thus, there are 200 face images for training and 200 face images for testing, out of a total of 400 face images. The results of the first experiment which examines the recognition accuracy of the different approaches on ORL and JAFFE database are presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. As presented in Table 1 the maximum recognition rate achieved using the proposed methods are comparable with the Gaussian integration approach, however, the proposed method performs much better than the direct method. The same trend is also observed on JAFEE database, where the proposed method outperforms the traditional method. This is due to the fact that the proposed methods remove the numerical integration and geometric errors from PHTs which leads to improve its performance as a feature extraction descriptor and hence produce distinct features have the ability to distinguishing the face images under different variations. The rotation invariant trait of the proposed method has also been investigated. For this purpose a two experiments have been carried out, in both experiments the same datasets that have been utilized in the previous section has been adopted except that the test face images have been rotated with 30 ∘ , 45 ∘ , and 180 ∘ while the training face images are taken without rotation angle, Figs. 3 and 4 show two face images and their rotated versions used in the above mentioned experiments. The results of these experiments are presented in Tables 3 and 4 for ORL and JAFFE database respectively. It observed that the recognition rates of the proposed method slightly effected at rotation angle 30 ∘ while it remain stable at 180. The maximum effect in the recognition rates is takes place at rotation angle 45 ∘ where the recognition rates have dropped approximately less than 1%. The same conclusion is observed also in [20,21]. However, at this rotation angle the maximum change in the positions of the face image pixels is occurred which leads to unrecognizing the face image by other rotation variant methods therefore, the proposed methods are rotation invariant and achieved high recognition rates even in presence of rotation variation. 5 Conclusion PHTs are the effective region based shape descriptors. Their coefficients extracted from a set of orthogonal and complete basis function. The magnitude of PHTs is invariant to rotation and by using some transformation it can be made translation and scale invariant. PHTs are orthogonal, therefore they possesses distinct characteristics which are low information redundancy and good image reconstruction capability. PHTs are more robust to noise than other orthogonal rotation invariants techniques. The accuracy of PHTs is severely influence by the numerical integration and geometric errors. These errors decrease the quality of reconstructed image of PHTs magnitude. The proposed technique reduces these errors and to provide numerical stability at higher order moment. The results of the extensive experimental carried out in this work refer that the suggested technique provides accurate computation of PHTs which leads to improve the quality of reconstructed image and invariance properties of PHTs magnitude.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.090,"Effect of the synthesis conditions on the structural, morphological and optical properties of Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 nanoparticles","Abstract Beside their promising utility as thermoelectric generators, Bi2Te3 and related compounds have several applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this work, Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully prepared via physical vapor deposition technique at different conditions of flow rate and temperature. The x-ray diffraction patterns show that, the NPs crystallize in a rhombohedral crystal structure with preferable growth along the (015) plane. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) investigation shows that the NPs size depends significantly on the synthesis conditions of flow rate and temperature where it decreases with the decrease in the former or with the increase in the later. The effect of deposition conditions on the final morphology can be interpreted through the accompanied variation in the concentration of the gaseous precursors in the hot zone. The optical properties were studied using Kubelka-Munk theory. Optical band gaps of 0.52, 0.58, 0.53 eV were determined for the samples synthesized under different conditions.",Apr-18," Keywords Bi2Te3 Physical vapour deposition Optical Chalcogenide Kubelka-Munk theory 1 Introduction Bi2Te3 and its based solid solutions are layered structure with rhombohedral unit cell (space group:R-3m) such that the bismuth and tellurium atoms are arranged in parallel layers following the sequence Te(1)-Bi-Te(2)−Bi-Te [1] which is continually repeated [1]. In addition to their efficiency as thermoelectric materials [2–5] which culminated in the fabrication of thermoelectric generator and thermo-coolers, these compounds have several applications in electronics, microelectronics, optoelectronics and electromechanical devices [6]. For example, such compounds are used as photoconductive targets in TV cameras, IR spectroscopy, IR detectors and sensors [7–10]. Also, Bi2Te3 is a narrow band gap semiconductor and thus it could be exploited in other applications like temperature controller in laser diode [11] and optical recording system [12]. According to the presence of point defects, Bi2Te3 can exhibit either p- or n- type conduction but n-type is the most common as a result of considerable amount of anti-site point defects through the occupying of Te site with bismuth site [6].There are several strategies that were introduced to improve the thermoelectric performance of Bi2Te3 like doping, nanostructuring and nanocomposites [13]. Indeed, a great enhancement was achieved especially in nanostructures which can be attributed to the increase of density of states (DOS) and the decrease in the thermal conductivity through the scattering of the phonons across the boundaries [14]. Doping with antimony (Sb) [15] and selenium (Se) [16] is adopted strategy in order to enhance the physical properties of Bi2Te3. There are various techniques that are used for the synthesis of Bi2Te3 based compounds such as thermal evaporation [17], co-sputtering [18] molecular beam epitaxy [19], solvothermal method [20],etc. In this work, Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 compound has been synthesized by physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. Although, this compound has fuelled an intense research as an efficient thermoelectric material, few papers that focused on studying the effect of deposition on its structure, morphology and optical properties which have been presented here. 2 Experimental method Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 NPs were synthesized from a bulk alloy as a source material using the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique and the procedures can be summarized as the following: (i) The source material was placed in the hot zone at a certain temperature (T) to transform the solidus material to gaseous phase. (ii) Argon gas (Ar) was used as a carrier gas to transport the NPs formed in the gaseous phase to the cold zone. (iii) The Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 NPs were deposited on glass substrates placed in the cold zone at temperature not higher than 200 °C. (iv) After furnace cooling to the room temperature, the deposited NPs were extracted from the cold zone for carrying out the various investigations and measurements. Noteworthy, three samples of deposited Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 NPs were synthesized at different conditions of temperature and flow rate, specifically, (1035 °C, 270 SCCM), (825 °C, 270 SCCM) and (825 °C, 225 SCCM) and denoted in the following as sample A–C, respectively as a matter of facilitation. The samples were characterized using the x-ray diffraction (XRD) (Brucker Axs-D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation at λ = 0.154178 nm). The surface morphology and structure were demonstrated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) model: Quanta FEG250 for imaging the surface morphology. To study the optical properties of the synthesized samples, A Jascov-570 UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer was employed to record the reflection spectrum over the wavelength range 200–2500 nm at both normal incidence and room temperature. Diffuse reflectance spectrum was obtained using a diffuse reflectance accessory model ISN-470, and the reflectance was converted by the instrument software to F(R) values according to Kubelka-Munk method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and morphology 3.1.1 Effect of deposition conditions on the structure Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the synthesized samples A–C. The data confirm that the NPs for all samples crystallize in polycrystalline rhombohedral structure with preferential orientation along (015) direction. With respect to the sample (A), all peaks can be indexed to Bi2Te3 compound with preferable growth through (015) plane. The peaks can be indexed using standard reflection data of JCPDS card no. 85–0439. The sharpness of the peaks confirms the good crystallinity of the products. No additional peaks correspond to Te, Se, Bi or other impurities were observed indicating to the high purity of the sample. The x-ray pattern of sample (B) reveals that the phase is Te-rich Bi2Te3 indicating the simultaneous co-existence of Bi2Te3 and Te atoms (denoted by *). Additional small peak corresponding to Bi (denoted by ♦) could be observed. Noteworthy, the strong appearance of Te peaks here can be attributed to the decrease in temperature in the hot zone. Where, once the thermal decomposition of the bulk alloy occurs, the elements begin to evaporate with different evaporation rate [21]. The decrease in temperature with fixing the flow rate of argon leads to a reduce in the concentration of the gaseous precursors in the hot zone and hence, the chance of Bi atom to meat and react with Te atom in the hot zone decreases which make limitation for the growth of Bi2Te3 phase. This hypothesis is also assured if we take in consideration that the nucleation and growth of Te atoms is faster than Bi2Te3 [22]. The x-ray data of sample (C) illustrates a decrease in the intensity of the Bi and Te peaks as shown in Fig. 2a. The reason for the lack of Te and Bi phases here can be attributed to the increase of the concentration of gaseous precursors in the hot zone compared to sample (B) due to the decrease in the flow rate which leads to the increase of the chance of Bi and Te atoms to react and form Bi2Te3 compound. The average crystallite size (DXRD) was calculated using Debye–Sherrer’s equation [23] D = 0.9 λ/β cos θ where, θ is the glancing angle, λ is the wavelength of Cu kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and β is the full width at half maximum. Also, The dislocation density(ρ) which assess the proportion of defects through the samples is calculated using this formula ρ = 1/(DXRD) 2 [24]. It is well known that as the crystallite size becomes smaller the lattice strain (ε) becomes larger and the x-ray diffraction peak becomes broader [25]. The strain is calculated using this formula ε = β cosθ/4 [26]. All the previously mentioned x-ray parameters are tabulated in Table 1 . According to the XRD parameters, one can observe that with decreasing temperature or flow rate the DXRD increases and this can be attributed to the resultant decrease of the density of species in the hot zone. Also, the ρ decreases with the decrease in either temperature or flow rate as a result to the crystallization process becomes more slower. In addition, as it is expected [25], a decrease in the lattice strain was found with the decrease in either temperature or flow rate due to the decrease in the dislocation density. 3.1.2 Effect of deposition conditions on the morphology Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images as shown in Fig. 1 (a–c) show that the synthesis conditions of temperature and flow rate have a significant effect on the final morphology of the products. To be specific, the images illustrate that the Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 consist of spherical NPs, but both of the average size and size distribution depend on the synthesis temperature and flow rate. The histograms depicted as insets in Fig. 1(a–c) reveal that the particles of sample (A) have much larger average size (∼600 nm) compared to that of sample (B) (∼228 nm). This can be attributed to the high synthesis temperature (1035 °C) which led to a high evaporation rate of the source material and thus a high concentration of the gaseous precursors in the reactor during the synthesis process. Also, due to high temperature in the reactor, the tiny particles coalesce in large particles due to the repining effect and growth continuation. In contrast, as the temperature was fixed at 825 °C (samples (B) and (C)), the decrease in the flow rate from 270 to 225 SCCM results in an increase in the particle size from ∼228 to 379 nm. This can be interpreted as the following: by decreasing the flow rate, the time of survival of the gaseous precursor in the hot zone becomes larger and tiny particles will coalesce to each other leading to the formation of larger particle size [27–28] 3.2 Optical properties Diffuse reflection spectrum of the samples under study were recorded at room temperature as shown in Fig. 3 a, then converted to absorption spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3b, by employing Kubelka–Munk theory [29–30] using the formula: F(R) = α = (1-R)2/2R, where α is the absorption coefficient, R is the diffuse reflection factor and F(R) is the Kubelka-Munk function. Using the calculated optical absorption coefficient through Kubelka–Munk theory, the optical band gap of Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 specimens were determined using Tauc’s law [31–32] [F(R)hν]n = β(hν-Eop ) in which hν, β, and Eop are the incident photon energy, proportionality constant, and optical band gap, respectively. The exponent n equals 2 or 1/2 for direct or indirect transitions, respectively. By extrapolating the linear portion of the plots of [F(R)hν]2 and [F(R)hν]1/2 versus hν (see Fig. 3c), the optical band gap (Eop) could be determined as shown in Fig. 2c.The calculated optical band gaps are 0.52, 0.58, 0.53 eV for samples (A)–(C), respectively. These values are larger than the values calculated for the bulk Bi2Te3 (0.15 eV) and this can be ascribed to both of the incorporation of Se instead of Te [33] in its lattice and the quantum confinement effects resulting from the nano-sized dimensions [34]. Kadhim et al. reported an optical band gap of 0.43 eV for Bi2Te3 which increased to 0.73 eV with Se incorporation [33]. Also, Zimmer et al. [35] determined a direct optical band gap of 0.6 eV for Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 thin film. It is worth mentioning that, in this work, the maximum value of the optical band gap (0.58 eV) was obtained for sample (B) and this can be attributed to both of the smaller particle size than samples A and C and the extra existence of unreacted Te atoms in it. The refractive index (n) of Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 samples at hand were calculated as presented elsewhere [36], and the corresponding average values of refractive index are 2.12, 1.88 and 1.9 in the visible regions and 1.82, 2 and 1.87 near infrared for samples (A)–(C), respectively (see Fig. 3d). The free carrier concentration (N) was estimated optically according to Drud's model as presented elsewhere [37]. The corresponding value of N for Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 samples were found to be equal to 3.59 × 1019, 1.75 × 1020 and 3.14 × 1019 cm−3 for the samples A–C, respectively. 4 Conclusion Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully prepared using physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique at different conditions of temperature and flow rate. XRD patterns confirm that the structure of the NPs is polycrystalline in nature and having rhombohedral crystal structure. The effect of deposition conditions on the internal structure and morphology was studied in detail. It was found that a significant decrease in the particle size can be obtained with a decrease in the temperature or an increase in the flow rate. Optical band gaps of 0.52, 0.58, 0.53 eV for the samples were calculated using Kubelka-Munk model. The difference in the value of the optical band gaps can be ascribed to the difference in both of the particle size and the proportion of unreacted Te atoms within the material. So, to obtain Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 NPs with desired purity, structure and morphology, the deposition conditions should be optimized. Our samples can be employed in several applications in optoelectronic devices. "," [1] D.M. Rowe CRC Handbook of Thermoelectrics, Macro to Nano 2006 CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group [2] D.A.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.026,Tunable structure of nanowire-grid polarizer for deep ultraviolet region,"Abstract As the performance of nanowire-grid polarizer is determined by the characteristic size of nanowire, the polarizer for full ultraviolet (UV) region requires the characteristic size less than 50 nm, which is challengeable to the current fabrication level. In this letter, two pieces of nanowire-grid polarizers sandwiching a layer of polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) was proposed as a tunable structure of nanowire-grid polarizer for high performance in deep ultraviolet region with 100 nm of nanowire period. In this structure, the transmittance of transverse electric (TE) mode (T TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) mode (T TM), and also the transmission extinction ratio (Ex) could be tuned by the optical path of the PDLC layer. Assuming the refractive index of PDLC layer could be varied from 1.5 to 1.6 as its applied voltage changed from saturation voltage to zero, we calculated the T TM and Ex, which varies periodically as the PDLC layer refractive index increasing. For a given incident wavelength, the maximums of T TM and Ex could be attained easily by tuning the applied voltage on PDLC layer. The simulation results show that the tunable structure has a short starting wavelength than that of single layer and double-layer structure nanowire-grid polarizer at a given transmission or extinction requirement with same characteristic size of nanowire, because of the constructive interference of TM polarization and the destructive interference of TE polarization in these two layers of nanowire, similar to a Fabry-Perot cavity, which makes it excellent to be applied in deep UV region.",Apr-18," Keywords Optical polarizer Nanowire-grid Extinction ratio Tunable structure 1 Introduction Nanowire-gird polarizer is an optical polarization device based on metallic nanometer structure. It has been widely applied in many fields, such as liquid crystal display [1,2], polarized LED [3,4], projection display [5], polarization control [6,7], and optical communication [8] for its advantages of high polarization performance and high degree of integration. In the last ten years, more and more attention has been paid to nanowire-grid polarizer, whose applied fields have been expanded to ultraviolet [9,10] and THz [11–13] regions from visible [14,15] and near-infrared [16,17] regions. It is the characteristic size of nanowire that determinates the starting application wavelength of nanowire-grid polarizer. Therefore, the smaller characteristic size, the shorter wavelength the polarizer could be applied in. The polarizer used in near-infrared and visible regions could be realized easily by nanowire-grid of 100 nm characteristic size, which could be fabricated by nanoimprint lithography technique [18]. Limited by the bottleneck of lithographic process, the smaller characteristic size of nanowire-grid for deep UV region is not easy to fabricate in current technological conditions; therefore, more excellent polarizer in UV region requires novel structure [19,20] or novel material [21]. In reference [15], Yang proposed a double-layer nanowire-grid structure and fabricated it on the two surfaces of substrate, which could achieve higher extinction ratio than single layer nanowire-grid structure in visible and infrared regions. However, in deep UV region from 200 to 400 nm, the transmittance and the extinction ratio fluctuate sharply, as the two layers of nanowire form a similar Fabry-Perot cavity, which is sensitive to incident wavelength. Therefore, some wavelengths could obtain high transmittance and high extinction due to the constructive interference, while other wavelengths could not satisfy this conditions, then the T TM and Ex drop sharply. To cover the full wave band of UV region, novel structures of nanowire-grid polarizer should be proposed when the characteristic size of nanowire could not be reduced distinctly in the short term. In this letter, a tunable structure composed of two nanowire-grid polarizers and a PDLC layer was proposed to reduce the starting application wavelength of polarizer and enhance the extinction from starting wavelength in UV region based on a similar Fabry-Perot resonator. We will calculate and compare the polarization properties of single layer structure, double-layer structure and tunable structure of nanowire-grid polarizer in details with the software FDTD solutions using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the tunable structure could achieve the maximum of T TM and the minimum of T TE simultaneously by tuning of the applied voltage on PDLC layers easily, which result in the maximum extinction ration (Ex) of tunable structure. Comparing with single layer and double-layer, the tunable structure has a shorter starting application wavelength, from which the polarizer could be applied suitably. This advantage will make it feasible to be applied as a novel polarizer in deep UV region. 2 Structure design Traditional structure of nanowire-grid polarizer, shown in Fig. 1 (a), has a single layer of metallic nanowire-grid fabricated in the central of substrate. Different from double-layer structure shown as Fig. 1(b), which has two layers of nanowire located in the upper and lower part of polarizer, respectively. The tunable structure is demonstrated in Fig. 1(c), which is composed by two independent single layer nanowire-grid polarizers and a sandwiched layer of PDLC. Additionally, two layers of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) film are coated on the surfaces of nanowire-grid polarizers to ensure the applied voltage could be imposed to the PDLC layer. In order to calculate the transmittance and transmission extinction ratio, we assume the period of two nanowire-grid layers is 100 nm, and the width of nanowire is 50 nm; the nanowire is square shape and in the central of substrate; the material of nanowire and substrate are Aluminum and fused silica, respectively; the thickness of nanowire-grid layer and substrate are 100 nm and 5 μm, respectively. In double-layer structure, the two layers are aligned in X direction and the space interval h is set to 5 μm in the silica substrate. In tunable structure, the nanowire-grid layers have the same structure parameters as single layer structure, while the thickness of PDLC layer and ITO layer are set to 5 μm and 50 nm, respectively. 3 Simulation and comparison To compare the polarization properties of single layer and double-layer structure nanowire-grid polarizer, we simulated their T TM and Ex with parameters set in preceding text by FDTD algorithm with periodic boundary conditions in X and Y directions and perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions in Z direction. The mesh is set to 10 nm in whole simulation region for accurate result. The calculation results of T TM and Ex for both single layer and double-layer structure are showed in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2(a), from 254 nm to longer wavelength, the double-layer structure has a higher transmission extinction than that of single layer; but less than this wavelength in deep UV region, the double-layer structure does not have any obvious advantage, as the extinction fluctuates dramatically around that of single layer structure. Similarly in Fig. 2(b), the transmittance of TM polarization (electric field parallel to the X direction) also fluctuates acutely and periodically as the change of incident wavelength around that curve of single layer structure, while significant portions are under this curve due to the extra absorption of the additional layer of metallic nanowires. However, when the wavelengths satisfy the constructive interference conditions for the TM polarization, their transmittance could reach to or even be higher than that of single layer structure. Therefore, in order to improve the polarization performance of double-layer structure in UV region, a tunable structure should be designed to make sure any wavelength could satisfy the conditions of constructive interference and attain higher T TM and Ex simultaneously. To understand the periodic fluctuation of Ex, we consider the double layers of nanowires as a similar Fabry-Perot resonator, the refractive and transmission efficiency of single layer structure is R and T respectively. Then, the transmission of double-layer structure T d could be calculated by Eq. (1), (1) T d = T 2 ( 1- R ) 2 + 4 R sin 2 ( φ 2 ) where φ is the phase difference of the two successive light beam in F-P cavity, which could be presented as Eq. (2), (2) φ = 4 π λ n h cos θ + 2 δ where n indicates the refractive index of substrate sandwiched by two layers of metallic nanowire; h is space interval of two nanowire-grid layers; θ is the incident angle; δ is the initial phase shift caused by refraction on the surface of metallic nanowires, which is determined by the metal material, and also influenced by the incident polarization. Therefore, the initial phase shift is different for TE polarization and TM polarization. As stated above, the double layers structure is a wavelength sensitive device. The transmission enhancement only occurs in a series of wavelengths which could satisfy Eq. (3), (3) φ = 2 m π where m is an arbitrary integral number. For the wavelengths that could not meet Eq. (3), especially when (4) φ = 2 m +1 π the double-layer structure has limited enhance effect or even has negative effect on the T TM and Ex. Comparing with double-layer structure, the tunable structure is feasible to tune the refractive index of PDLC layer in order to ensure that the φ of TM polarization (φ TM) in Eq. (2) could satisfy the Eq. (3) and TE polarization (φ TE) satisfy the condition described in Eq. (4). Therefore, the maximum of Ex could be achieved by the constructive interference of TM polarization and the destructive interference of TE polarization in the tunable structure. We simulated the polarization properties of tunable structure with the parameters assumed in preceding text. As mentioned in Ref. [22], PDLC is mixture of polymer and liquid crystal (LC), and its refractive index could be calculated by Eq. (5), (5) n P D L C = f * n L C + ( 1- f ) * n P where np and nLC denote the refractive index of the polymer and the nematic LC, f is the occupation ratio of LC in the PDLC. Based on the known parameters (ne = 1.679, no = 1.511, f = 0.6, np = 1.49 at 20 °C), the maximal refractive index of the polarized and oriented PDLC that we calculated is 1.60 without the applied voltage, while the minimum is 1.50 with the saturation voltage. Then, we could calculate the Ex and T TM of tunable structure at particular incident wavelength 200 nm as the refractive index of PDLC changing from 1.5 to 1.6, the result shows as Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3, the curves of transmittance could be considered as the product of a sinusoidal function and a rising or a declining amplitude function, the former is caused by Fabry-Perot resonance and the latter is caused by the absorption of interlayer between two nanowire-grid layers. According to Eq. (2), the curves of transmittance and Ex has a same period, determined by incident wavelength and space interval h of two nanowire-grid layers, which should be designed according the variation range of nPDLC . The peak values of Ex and T TM appear on the same refractive index because the TM and TE polarization have different initial phases δ caused by the two metallic nanowire-grid layers in tunable structure. In the case of normal incidence, the initial phase difference 2δ of TM and TE polarization in Eq. (2) is π by design, which makes T TM reaches maximum while T TE reaches minimum. Therefore, the fluctuation of T TM and Ex are synchronous, and their peaks will appear at the same refractive index of PDLC layer as shown in Fig. 3. To confirm the improvement performances of the tunable structure, we calculated the maximum value of Ex and T TM for tunable structure at a series of wavelengths from 210 to 280 nm in deep UV region, and drew up the curves in Fig. 4 . It is obvious that this tunable structure could achieve a higher extinction ration than that of double-layer structure in the whole ultraviolet region by tuning the refractive index of PDLC layer, which could be applied to enhance the Ex of double-layer structure and expand the applied region to shorter wave band from 254 nm to 216 nm when the minimum extinction requirement is set at 20 dB. As the increasing of wavelength, the extinction of tunable structure increases smoothly without drastic fluctuation, which is another advantage of tunable structure polarizer. 4 Conclusion In summary, a tunable structure of nanowire-grid polarizer, as an improved version of double-layer structure, is proposed and demonstrated to shorten the starting application wavelength into deep UV region with the same characteristic size of nanowire. The results of simulation indicate that double-layer structure is a similar Fabry-Perot resonator, which is sensitive to the incident wavelength and fluctuate drastically in extinction and transmittance, especially in UV region. Comparing with double-layer structure, the tunable structure could tune the optical path between these two layers of metallic nanowire to satisfy the condition of constructive interference, resulting in the maximum transmittance of TM polarization and the maximum transmission extinction ratio. Therefore, the tunable structure has shorter starting application wavelength and higher Ex, which makes it valuable to be applied in deep UV region that could not realize by single layer or double-layer nanowire-grid polarizer with the same characteristic size.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.092,Noise-like pulse erbium-doped fiber laser for supercontinuum generation,"Abstract Two kinds of noise-like pulse bunches are observed in an erbium-doped fiber ring laser for the first time. Picosecond- and submicrosecond-scale pulse bunches with energy of 0.32 nJ and 7.1 nJ, respectively, are generated and used in super-continuum generation. Using a 50-m dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) a 20-dB bandwidth of over 750 nm is obtained.",Apr-18," Keywords Fiber laser Supercontinuum Noise-like pulse PACS: PACS number(s): 42.55.Wd 42.65.Re 42.62.Fi 1 Introduction Noise-like pulse (NLP) erbium-doped fiber (EDF) lasers were first reported by Horowitz et al. [1]. The temporal signal of an NLP bunch consists of low-coherence femtosecond pulses with randomly varying amplitude, duration and position within an envelope of tens of picoseconds. The spectral width of an NLP bunch is very broad and can exceed the excitation bandwidth of EDFs. NLP bunches with energy as high as 15 nJ [2] or a spectral width of 120 nm [3] were achieved in EDF lasers. However, the temporal envelopes of all the NLP bunches obtained to date range between 10 ps and 1ns. Super-continuum (SC) generation can be realized using either pulsed or CW laser sources [4]. Astonishing results have been achieved using photonic crystal fibers or microstructured fibers with high nonlinearity and special dispersion profile. However, the fabrication of such fibers requires expensive equipment and material which are not commonly available. By taking advantage of their smooth and broad spectra, NLPs have been proposed as pump pulses for supercontinuum generation in nonlinear fibers [5–8]. Compared with schemes using ultra-short pulses, pulse distortion during amplification and signal-to-noise ratio are not a concern. Besides, special design of the fiber dispersion profile is not necessary. The theory of SC generation using NLPs was studied by simulations, and a 956-nm (1178–2134 nm) spectrum was obtained in experiment [5]. A 951-nm (1127–2078 nm) SC was realized [6–7] by using an NLP EDF ring laser, and a short-term spectral stability of ± 0.05 dB was measured [7]. Recently, SC generation in a 0.75-km conventional single-mode fiber was demonstrated using an NLP figure-eight fiber laser [9]. In this letter, an EDF laser operating in the NLP regime is designed for SC generation. NLP bunches with two kinds of unreported time scales are observed. Picosecond-scale NLP bunches with a temporal width of only 3.1 ps (bunch energy of 0.32 nJ), and submicrosecond-scale bunches with 7.1 nJ energy are generated and used in SC generation. A 20-dB spectrum over 750 nm is achieved by using the submicrosecond-scale NLP bunches. It should be noted that the wavelength region longer than 1750 nm cannot be measured in the experiment and the resulting SC is ∼100 nm broader in the short-wavelength edge than those of previous reports using NLP sources [5–7]. Besides, the SC media is only a 50-m conventional DSF rather than a special fiber [4–7], which shows the efficiency of the proposed NLP fiber laser as a SC source. 2 Experimental setup and principles The EDF laser generating picosecond-scale NLP bunches is shown in Fig. 1 . A 124-cm EDF (80 dB/m absorption ratio at 1530 nm) is pumped by a 976 nm laser diode with a maximum power of 600 mW through the wavelength division multiplexer. The nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) plus polarization selection technique is used as the modelocking mechanism. A polarization-dependent isolator sandwiched by two polarization controllers realizes the polarization selection and the unidirectional propagation. A 134-cm DSF and a 4.6-cm polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) with birefringence BPMF  = 2.2 × 10−4 are used to optimize the cavity. A 10/90 optical coupler is used as output. The cavity frequency is 34.3 MHz and the net group velocity dispersion (GVD) is ∼0.004 ps2. A 140-m highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) with a GVD of −0.7 ps2/km and the nonlinear parameter of 20 W−1/km is added later in the cavity to generate submicrosecond-scale NLP bunches. The output of the laser is amplified by an EDFA and then input into a 50-m DSF for SC generation. It is noted that the major difference between the proposed NLP laser and a conventional ultrafast fiber laser [10–11] is the inclusion of the PMF to increase the cavity birefringence which focuses the fiber laser on the NLP regime. Large cavity birefringence was believed to cause NLP output [1]. Although Zhao et al. [2–3] claimed the NLP operation as an intrinsic regime, simulations in ref. [12] showed that the cavity birefringence is beneficial for NLP generation. In the experiment, when the PMF is not included in the cavity, modelocking results besides NLPs, such as multipulses and bound states, have been observed. The PMF makes it possible for the NLP operation to be the only working regime other than CW generation and eliminates all the otherwise possible mode-locking outputs. Furthermore, the combination of the PMF, PDI and the NPE establishes a weak band-pass filtering mechanism [13] which flattens the output NLP spectrum. The 3-dB bandwidth of such filter is (1) Δ λ ≈ λ c 2 2 ∑ n L n B n − 1 where, λ c is the central wavelength, L = ∑ n L n is the total cavity length, and B n is the birefringence of the fibers. To demonstrate the role the PMF plays in spectrum flattening, Fig. 2 shows the output NLP spectra when PMFs with different lengths are spliced in the cavity. The central wavelength and the shape of an output NLP spectrum can be changed slightly by tuning the two PCs. Each of the spectra in Fig. 2 is the flattest one that can be obtained. Since the research focus is on the shape of the spectra, we have some of the spectra shifted horizontally by several nanometers so that all the spectra are distinguishable. It should be noted that, although PMF is beneficial for NLP generation, it doesn’t mean the longer the better. Actually, there is no result other than CW when the PMF is longer than 11 cm. When the PMF is cut back to 10.2 cm, the NLP spectrum is very coarse as a result of the polarization mode dispersion induced by the PMF. It’s assumed that the average birefringence of the fibers in the cavity except for the PMF is B a v e = 5 × 10 − 7 . According to Eq. (1), we can find that the filter bandwidth is 50 nm, 76 nm, 85 nm and 100 nm for the 10.8−, 6.4−, 5.6− and 4.6-cm PMF, respectively. The filter bandwidth is increased and the top of the filtering curve is flattened by decreasing the PMF length. Therefore, the output spectrum becomes flatter, and the spectrum wings grow. Although the filtering effect is weak because of the low-coherence nature of NLPs, the top flattening effect can be observed. The increase in PMF length will enlarge birefringence, which is beneficial for NLP generation. However, the longer PMF will reduce the filter bandwidth, which is harmful to NLP generation. In our experiments, the flattest supercontinuum was generated with the PMF of 4.6 cm. In the rest of the experiment, the length of the PMF is kept at 4.6 cm. The autocorrelation (AC) signal of a picosecond-scale NLP bunch is a coherent femtosecond-scale peak resident on the shoulders of a picosecond-scale pulse. For example, the inset of Fig. 2 shows the normalized AC signal corresponding to the spectrum of the 4.6-cm PMF, which is a 122-fs spike on the top of a 1.26-ps pulse assuming a Gaussian pulse shape. In SC generation using NLP bunches [5], after the first few meters of propagation, the NLP bunch is compressed and the spectrum slightly broadens. Then it breaks into short pulses and dispersive waves. Those short pulses form the spectrum in the longer wavelength region due to nonlinear effects, and the dispersive waves spread out to shorter wavelength region. Thus, the majority of the energy is red-shifted, and a relatively uniform continuum is formed at the short wavelength region. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 3 (a) shows the optimum NLP output from the laser. The FWHM of the spectrum is 75 nm and the output power is 11 mW. Since there is always only one NLP bunch in one cavity round-trip, the output pulse bunch energy is 0.32 nJ. The inset shows the corresponding AC signal which is a 92-fs spike on a 2-ps pulse. To our knowledge, this laser outputs the shortest NLP bunches ever reported in fiber lasers. By tuning the PCs in the cavity, the optimum SC with a 20-dB spectral width over 612 nm, shown as the black curve of Fig. 3(b), is generated. The SC extends several hundreds of nanometers in the region longer than 1750 nm [6]. Unfortunately, limited by the instruments the whole spectrum cannot be measured. As is seen in Fig. 3(b), the NLP spectrum peak near 1550 nm is consumed by SC generation process. And the spectrum in the short wavelength region is very flat. The dip near 1500 nm can be overcome by increasing the power of the NLP bunches input into the SC media [5]. However, for a fixed input power, increasing the length of the DSF deepens the dip and extends the flat part of the SC to an even shorter wavelength. Accordingly, the length of the DSF is chosen to be 50 m based on the maximum power input into the DSF so that the dip is tolerable. The AC signal corresponding to the NLP laser output is shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The SC seed in Fig. 3(b) deviates from the optimum NLP output in Fig. 3(a). Its spectrum has a stronger peak near 1550 nm where the GVD of DSF is near zero, resulting in stronger phase matching required in four wave mixing [4]. Then the EDFA boosts the power from 12 mW to 132.8 mW (3.9 nJ pulse bunch energy) for SC generation. Although this input power is one order of magnitude lower than that in Ref. [5], the much higher pulse bunch energy and the larger peak power resulting from the shorter pulse bunch width enable the picosecond-scale NLP bunches to generate SC with almost the same broadness in the wavelength region shorter than 1750 nm. Furthermore, since fiber nonlinearity is crucial to the spectral broadening in SC generation, using a 50-m DSF instead of a HNLF implies that this NLP fiber laser is more efficient in SC generation than previous NLP sources. The output power of the SC is 25.6 mW. It is believed that a broader bandwidth and a larger spectral density can be achieved if a more powerful EDFA is used. The submicrosecond-scale NLP bunches, as shown in the upper row of Fig. 4 (a), are generated by inserting a 140-m HNLF into the fiber laser. In the cavity, an NLP bunch suffers the saturation absorption. Since the pulse bunch energy spreads to submicrosecond scale due to the large GVD of the HNLF, the peak power of the small pulses become weaker. The HNLF provides the nonlinear phase shift required by the NPE. The repetition rate is 1.41 MHz. Sub-nanosecond pulses are randomly hopping in the submicrosecond pulse bunch. The output power is 10 mW (7.1 nJ pulse bunch energy). The spectrum, shown as the blue line in Fig. 4(b), has a peak with the FWHM of 20 nm centered at 1559 nm plus a small peak resulting from the Raman effect in the HNLF. The bandwidth of the filtering effect is estimated to be 15 nm. The submicrosecond pulse train is amplified to 152.8 mW, 108.4 nJ and input into the 50-m DSF. In Fig. 4(b), the SC (black line) has a 20-dB spectral width over 750 nm, which is much wider compared with that (red line) generated using the picosecond-scale NLP bunch. Given the fact that the pump powers used in the laser and the EDFA are the same for the picosecond- and the submicrosecond-scale NLP bunches, the latter one is more efficient in SC generation. The lower repetition rate resulting from the longer laser cavity results in the higher pulse bunch energy after amplification in the EDFA and increases the efficiency. The output power of the SC is 24.4 mW. The pulse train after the DSF is shown in the lower row of Fig. 4(a). The NLP fiber laser and SC system are robust enough to generate stable optimum spectra for over several hours. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, noise-like pulse bunches with two unreported time scales are generated and used for SC generation. These noise-like pulse bunches are more effective in supercontinuum generation than those in previous reports using noise-like pulse sources. Especially, supercontinuum with flat spectrum over 750 nm was experimentally observed using submicrosecond scale noise-like pulse bunches.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.028,Statistical characteristics of a Gaussian beam reflected by a retro-reflector in atmospheric turbulence,"Abstract The statistical characteristics of a retro-reflector reflecting a Gaussian beam is analyzed, which shows that the retro-reflector can be approximately characterized by an ABCD ray-transfer matrix, and a monostatic system in atmospheric turbulence with a retro-reflector as the target is processed with ABCD ray matrix theory. Analytical expressions are developed for the basic statistical moments, the degree of coherence and the scintillation index of the retro-reflected wave are calculated in terms of three fundamental statistical moments, and then the backscatter amplification effect associated with these properties are discussed. As comparisons, the results of both monostatic and bistatic cases of a plane mirror are also presented. All the results are based on the weak turbulence with von Karman spectrum.",Apr-18," Keywords Atmospheric turbulence Retro-reflector Degree of coherence Scintillation index 1 Introduction A retro-reflector can reflect the incident wave back along the coming path, so it is widely used as a cooperative target to strengthen the intensity of the reflected wave in the monostatic systems, such as the lidar system [1], the laser ranging system and so on. n these applications it is inevitable to involve the problem of light propagation through the turbulent atmosphere in which case the wave front is usually distorted and the performance of the systems [2] may be greatly influenced, therefore, the research of the reflected wave from a retro-reflector in turbulence is necessary. The atmospheric turbulence may cause the decay of coherence, scintillation of intensity, beam wandering and spreading and so on, which were firstly studied with geometrical optics in the early time in the last century [3,4]; however, the strict condition required for the approach limits its range of application. Later several different theories [5,6], such as Rytov Method, the Markov Equations, Huygens principle and Feynman integral had been developed for light propagation through atmospheric turbulence and all led to analytic results with varying degrees of success, but also were restricted by different difficulties. The most widely used one of these theories is Rytov Method which was introduced by Tatarskii [7] and has been a classical theory until today in condition of weak turbulence [8]. In 1980’s, Yura and Hanson revealed that the Huygens–Fresnel integral to study the optical wave propagation through a complex paraxial optical system can be formulated with an ABCD ray matrix [9]. Subsequently, this method was combined with Rytov Method by L. C. Andrews to solve problems in the optical system in atmospheric turbulence [10] and was further extended to solve the double-pass wave propagation when the target is a mirror or a phase screen. An interesting phenomenon called the backscatter amplification effect or enhanced backscatter was discovered in 1970’s, and later was found widely existing in the double passage problems. In 1980s’ with local Green’s function Banakh and Mironov had studied extensively this subject and gained results including amplification effect associated with the MCF and the average intensity of the reflected waves from an unbounded plane mirror, a point reflector or a diffuse target for plane wave or spherical wave incidence [11]. L. C. Andrews and his partners also investigated the amplification effect for reflected wave from a mirror or a retro-reflector [12], by dividing the perturbation caused by the turbulence into two parts associated with the folded path and the reciprocal path [13], respectively. But their numerical results were restricted in several special situations. In this paper we firstly prove that the retro-reflector can be approximately seen as an ABCD optical element, and then the ABCD ray-matrix theory is developed for the double-passage propagation with a retro-reflector as the target. In terms of three basic statistical moments, several second-order and forth-order statistical moments of interest are derived and numerically calculated. Amplification effect associated with the scintillation index is discussed. 2 Property of the retro-reflector A retro-reflector is a solid tetrahedron composed of a base surface and three right-angle surfaces perpendicular to each other, which can reflect the wave back to the incidence direction. However, not all the wave incident on the retro-reflector can be reflected back. When the wave incidents on the optical surface normally, the effective reflecting area is shown in Fig. 1 , the aperture of the reflector is hexagonal [14]. In practice, most retro-reflectors are cut around the inscribed circle. It can be seen that the aperture of the retro-reflector is circular or approximately circular. In the condition of normal incidence, the performance of the retro-reflector reflecting a wave is rotational symmetrical [15], so it can be characterized by an ABCD ray-transfer matrix. If a ray incidents on the retro-reflector in position x 1 in direction x 1 ' , the position and the direction of the output ray are (1) x 2 x 2 ' = − 1 0 0 − 1 x 1 x 1 ' The ray matrix of the retro-reflector without considering the edge effect is (2) A inf B inf C inf D inf = − 1 0 0 − 1 Assuming that the retro-reflector has a Gaussian aperture with effective aperture radius W R , and by introducing the notation α R = 2 / k W R 2 , a finite retro-reflector can be modeled as a connection of a Gaussian lens and an infinite retro-reflector. (3) A B C D = 1 0 i α R 1 − 1 0 0 − 1 = − 1 0 − i α R − 1 3 Wave propagation by ABCD ray matrix In a monostatic system shown in Fig. 1, wave propagates forward and backward through the same path, for convenience, the coincident paths are unfolded into the same direction as shown in Fig. 2 . The optical field of a Gaussian-beam wave of unit amplitude at the emitting aperture of a transmitter can be expressed by [6] (4) U 0 r , 0 = exp − 1 2 α k r 2 where α = 2 / k W 0 2 + i / F 0 , k is the optical wave number, W 0 is the effective beam radius, F 0 is the phase front radius of curvature, r is a vector transverse to the propagation axis. The Gaussian–beam turns to a plane wave if α = 0 , or a spherical wave if α = ∞ . Propagating through a complex paraxial optical system characterized by an ABCD ray-matrix in the absence of turbulence, the field of the Gaussian-beam can be described by the generalized Huygens-Fresnel integral (5) U 0 r , L = − i k 2 π B exp i k L ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ d 2 s U 0 s , 0 exp i k 2 B A s 2 − 2 s ⋅ r + D r 2 = 1 p L exp i k L exp − 1 2 β L k r 2 where A–D are the ray-matrix elements for the overall propagation path, 1 / p L is complex on-axis amplitude of the beam (6) p L = A + i α B (7) β L = α D − i C A + i α B = 2 k W 2 + i 1 F While in the presence of the turbulence, the field at the plane z = L can be written as (8) U r , L = U 0 r , L exp ψ r , L where U 0 r , L is the field in Eq. (4), ψ r , L is the complex phase perturbation caused by turbulence, in Rytov approximation it can be written as (9) ψ r , L = ψ 1 r , L + ψ 2 r , L + ⋯ = χ r , L + i s r , L where ψ 1 and ψ 2 are the first- and second-order perturbation terms, χ and s denote the log- amplitude and the phase of the complex perturbation, respectively. In Rytov theory, all the second- and fourth-order statistical moments can be expressed in terms of three basic field moments as (10) E 1 0 , 0 = ψ 2 r , L + 1 2 ψ 1 2 r , L = − 2 L π k 2 ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n κ , ξ d 2 κ d ξ (11) E 2 r 1 , r 2 = ψ 1 r 1 , L ψ 1 ∗ r 2 , L (12) E 3 r 1 , r 2 = ψ 1 r 1 , L ψ 1 r 2 , L where E 1 0 , 0 only depends on the length of the path, while E 2 r 1 , r 2 and E 3 r 1 , r 2 only depend on ψ 1 . To calculate ψ 1 , the spectral representation is introduced (13) ψ 1 r ,L = i k ∫ 0 L ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ exp i γ κ ⋅ r − i κ 2 γ 2 k B z , L d ν κ , z d z where B z , L is the matrix element B, representing the general distance in the optical system from L to z , and γ = p z / p L is the ratio of the complex on-axis amplitude of the beam at the plane z = L in the absence of a random medium to that at arbitrary position z along the propagation path, d ν κ , z is the spectrum of the fluctuation of the refractive index of the atmosphere. (14) n 1 r , z = ∫ − ∞ ∞ exp i κ ⋅ r d ν κ , z where n r , z = 1 + n 1 r , z . Eq. (11) can be extended to the double- passage propagation as: (15) ψ 1 r ,L = i k ∫ 0 L ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ exp i γ 1 κ ⋅ r − i κ 2 γ 1 2 k B z , 2 L d v κ , z d z + i k ∫ 0 L ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ exp i γ 2 κ ⋅ r − i κ 2 γ 2 2 k B z ' , 2 L d v κ , z ' d z ' The first integral term represents the phase fluctuation in the forward propagation, 0 ≤ z ≤ L , the corresponding ABCD ray-matrix is (16) A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 = 1 z 0 1 = 1 L 1 − ξ 0 1 where ξ = 1 − z / L . The last integral term represents the phase fluctuation in the backward propagation, z ' = L − z , then the corresponding ABCD ray-matrix will be (17) A 2 B 2 C 2 D 2 = 1 z ' 0 1 − 1 0 − i α R − 1 1 L 0 1 = − 1 − i α R L η − L 1 + η + i α R L η − i α R − 1 − i α R L where η = z ' / L , which leads to (18) p L = 1 + i α L , p z = 1 + i α z and (19) p 2 L = − 1 − α α R L 2 + i L α R + 2 α , p z ' = − 1 − α α R L 2 η + i L α R η + α + α η Then the ratios of the complex on-axis amplitude can be expressed as (20) γ 1 = p z p 2 L , γ 2 = p z ' p 2 L In addition (21) B z , 2 L = − L 1 + ξ + i α R L ξ , B z ' , 2 L = L − z ' = L ( 1 − η ) By substituting Eqs. (18)–(21) to Eq. (15), the expression of ψ 1 can be derived, and further Eqs. (11 and 12) can be specialized as (22) E 2 ( r 1 , r 2 ) = 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n ( κ , ξ ) e x p i κ ⋅ ( γ 1 r 1 − γ 1 * r 2 ) − i κ 2 2 k [ γ 1 B ( ξ ) − γ 1 * B * ( ξ ) ] d 2 κ ξ + 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n ( κ , ξ ) e x p i κ ⋅ ( γ 2 r 1 − γ 2 * r 2 ) − i κ 2 2 k [ γ 2 − γ 2 * ) L ( 1 − ξ ) ] d 2 κ ξ + 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n ( κ , ξ ) e x p i κ ⋅ ( γ 1 r 1 − γ 2 * r 2 ) − i κ 2 2 k [ γ 2 B ( ξ ) − γ 2 * L ( 1 − ξ ) ] d 2 κ ξ + 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n ( κ , ξ ) e x p i κ ⋅ ( γ 2 r 1 − γ 1 * r 2 ) − i κ 2 2 k [ γ 2 ( 1 − ξ ) − γ 1 * B * ( ξ ) ] d 2 κ ξ (23) E 3 r 1 , r 2 = − 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n κ , ξ exp i γ 1 κ ⋅ r 1 − r 2 − i κ 2 k γ 1 B ξ d 2 κ d ξ − 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n κ , ξ exp i γ 2 κ ⋅ r 1 − r 2 − i κ 2 k γ 2 L 1 − ξ d 2 κ d ξ − 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n κ , ξ exp i κ ⋅ γ 1 r 1 − γ 2 r 2 − i κ 2 2 k γ 1 B ξ + γ 2 L 1 − ξ d 2 κ d ξ − 2 π k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ − ∞ ∞ Φ n κ , ξ exp i κ ⋅ γ 2 r 1 − γ 1 r 2 − i κ 2 2 k γ 2 L 1 − ξ + γ 1 B ξ d 2 κ d ξ As the wave propagates forward and backward through the same path, phase fluctuations caused by turbulence are also correlated, meaning that the integral terms in Eq. (15) are correlated. The statistical moments E 2 r 1 , r 2 and E 3 r 1 , r 2 both contain four terms, the first two terms of which are the self-correlations of the forward and backward propagation and the last two terms are the cross-correlation of the forward and backward propagation. In most applications the atmospheric turbulence can be considered as isotropic, Φ n κ , ξ does not depend on the direction. Eqs. (10), (22) and (23) are integrated on the variable for direction, leading to (24) E 1 0 , 0 = − 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ Φ n κ , ξ d κ d ξ (25) E 2 r 1 , r 2 = 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 2 k γ 1 B ξ − γ 1 * B * ξ J 0 κ ⋅ γ 1 r 1 − γ 1 * r 2 d κ d ξ + 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 2 k γ 2 − γ 2 * 1 − ξ J 0 κ ⋅ γ 2 r 1 − γ 2 * r 2 d κ d ξ + 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 2 k γ 1 B ξ − γ 2 * L 1 − ξ J 0 κ ⋅ γ 1 r 1 − γ 2 * r 2 d κ d ξ + 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 2 k γ 2 1 − ξ − γ 1 * B * ξ J 0 κ ⋅ γ 2 r 1 − γ 1 * r 2 d κ d ξ (26) E 3 r 1 , r 2 = − 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 k γ 1 B ξ J 0 γ 1 κ ⋅ r 1 − r 2 d κ d ξ − 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 k γ 2 1 − ξ J 0 γ 2 κ ⋅ r 1 − r 2 d κ d ξ − 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 2 k γ 1 B ξ + γ 2 L 1 − ξ J 0 κ ⋅ γ 1 r 1 − γ 2 r 2 d κ d ξ − 4 π 2 k 2 L ∫ 0 1 ∫ 0 ∞ κ Φ n κ , ξ exp − i κ 2 2 k γ 2 1 − ξ + γ 1 B ξ J 0 κ ⋅ γ 2 r 1 − γ 1 r 2 d κ d ξ In this paper, the propagating path in turbulence is set as horizontal and normal to the optical surface of the finite reflector with a size parameter Ω R = 2 L / k W R 2 . Atmospheric turbulence is characterized by von Karman spectrum with structure constant C n 2 = 2.46 × 10 − 15 m − 2 / 3 , outer scale L 0 = 10 m and inner scale l 0 = 1 cm . The wavelength is chosen as λ = 1.38 μm , the wave type may be plane, spherical or collimated Gaussian beams with beam parameter Ω = 2 L / k W 0 2 . Eqs. (24–26) are numerically computed and further several statistical moments of interest are expressed in terms of the basic moments. 4 Spatial coherence properties Spatial coherence property is an important second-order statistical moment, which directly reflects the degree of distortion of the reflected field. The Degree of Coherence is defined as (27) γ r 1 , r 2 , 2 L = Γ 2 r 1 , r 2 , 2 L I r 1 , 2 L I r 2 , 2 L 1 / 2 = exp E 2 r 1 , r 2 − 1 2 E 2 r 1 , r 1 − 1 2 E 2 r 2 , r 2 Since r 1 and r 2 are two arbitrary points on the receiving plane, it is difficult to obverse the pattern of Degree of Coherence, a limit is usually set as r 1 = − r 2 and the function γ can then be written as (28) γ r 1 , − r 1 , 2 L = γ ρ , 2 L = exp E 2 r 1 , − r 1 − E 2 r 1 , r 1 where ρ = r 1 − r 2 = 2 r 1 . Fig. 3 shows the Degree of Coherence versus the separation distance, it can be seen that the backscatter amplification effect also influences the spatial coherence of the reflected field. The retro-reflector increases the Degree of Coherence whereas the mirror decrease it, which means that field reflected by a retro-reflector is less distorted by turbulence. The coherence length is introduced to reflect the falling speed of the Degree of Coherence, which can be obtained when γ ρ 0 , 2 L = e − 1 . Fig. 4 shows the coherence lengths normalized by ρ P versus the parameter Ω R , where ρ P is the plane wave coherence length, ρ P = 1.46 C n 2 k 2 L − 3 / 5 . For a large reflector, the coherence length of backscattered wave from a mirror is the lowest in all cases and on the contrary that for a retro-reflector is the highest, and for a small reflector, the situation is inversed. The point of transition is where the amplification effect for reflected wave from a mirror becomes zero. However, the tendency of coherence length for a retro-reflector seems to be different, ρ 0 for reflected wave from a large retro-reflector is larger than that from a small retro-reflector. In fact, further calculation shows that coherence length of plane wave from an infinite large retro-reflector is infinite, which cannot be true. It can be found in the case of a plane wave reflected by an infinite retro-reflector the two rays propagating through r 1 and r 2 = − r 1 propagates through the same paths in opposite directions, so field at the two symmetrical points remain highly coherent. Therefore, γ r 1 , − r 1 , 2 L can not reflect the real distribution of spatial coherence. Another limit for the separation points is introduced to calculate the coherence length for the retro-reflector case, r 2 = 0 . The results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . The curve of coherence length varying with Ω R is similar to the one in Fig. 4 for a mirror but higher than the latter. The curves of coherence length are mainly increasing with the increase of Ω , except for the coherence length of wave from a point which does not change with Ω . 5 Scintillation index In practical applications, for example a lidar system, scintillation index is an important factor that influences the performance of the system. Calculating the scintillation index of the backscattered wave from different targets in atmospheric turbulence is of great significance. Scintillation index can be expressed with the basic statistical moments (29) σ I 2 r , 2 L ≅ 2 Re E 2 r , r + E 3 r , r Fig. 7 presents the curves of on-axis scintillation index with L , including both the theoretical and simulated results. The simulated curves and the theoretical ones agree well when L is small, and diverge as L gets very large. Fig. 8 shows the curves of on-axis scintillation index with Ω R and Fig. 9 shows the curves of on-axis scintillation index with Ω . Calculation shows that on-axis scintillation index in the cases of a mirror and retro-reflector are the same, so the curves are for both mirror and retro-reflector. The curves in the figures are all V-shaped, which means that the minimum σ I 2 0 , 2 L occurs in the case that the size of reflector is a little smaller than the first Frensel zone Ω R = 2 ∼ 3 and the width of beam is similar as the first Frensel zone Ω = 1 ∼ 2 . The left side of each curve are higher than the right side, meaning that a small reflector ( Ω R ≪ 1 ) causes less scintillation than a big one ( Ω R ≫ 1 ) does, and a narrow beam Ω ≪ 1 products less scintillation than a wide one ( Ω ≫ 1 ) does. For limited inner and outer scales, the scintillations indexes become smaller. The inner scale influences the scintillation index much whereas the outer scale influences it little, which is different from the cases of mean intensity and the coherence length. Amplification effect also influences the scintillation index, similar as the intensity amplification factor, the scintillation amplification factor is defined as (30) N s r = σ I 2 r , 2 L / σ I 2 r , 2 L i n c o h (31) σ I 2 r , 2 L i n c o h ≅ 2 Re E 2 r , r + E 3 , i n c o h r , r where E 3 , i n c o h r , r is the sum of the first two terms in Eq. (26). Fig. 10 shows the on-axis scintillation amplification factor N s 0 . It is mainly Ω that influences N s 0 whereas the size of reflector has little effect on N s 0 especially for narrow beams Ω > 10 . The scintillation amplification factor of plane wave is around 1.5 while that of spherical wave is exactly 2.0. It can be found that the limited inner and outer scales slightly increase N s 0 for a limited reflector whereas for a spherical wave the inner and outer scales have no effects on N s 0 . Fig. 11 shows the scintillation amplification factor at the receiving plane as a function of the normalized transverse distance from the optical axis in different cases. For a plane wave reflected by a infinite mirror, the amplification effect exists on the whole receiving plane as a constant, for other kind of wave reflected by a mirror, the amplification effect reduces slowly as the transverse distance gets bigger. For a wave reflected by a retro-reflector, the amplification effect reduces much faster as the transverse increases. Another difference from the case of mirror is that as the transverse increases the amplification effect for a retro-reflector may become negative. 6 Conclusion Under the assumption of the weak scintillation theory and within the framework of a rotationally symmetric complex ABCD paraxial optical system, analytical expressions are derived for the basic statistical moments for the reflected wave from a retro-reflector. Some statistical moments, including mean irradiance, degree of coherence and scintillation index, are obtained in terms of the basic moments. Amplification effect related to these moments is discussed in the paper. The calculated results show that the reflected wave from a retro-reflector has a higher intensity and a bigger intensity amplification factor than that for a plane mirror. And the coherence length of the retro-reflected wave is larger than that of the mirror-reflected wave. As the scintillation index is concerned, the reflected wave from a retro-reflector is the same as that from a mirror on the optical axis but lower at other position on the receiving plane. In a word, the reflected wave from a retro-reflector has a better property than that from a mirror in every way. The properties of the reflected field are mainly discussed as function of the reflector size parameter Ω R and the beam width parameter Ω . Variations mainly happen near the first Frensel zone ( 0.1 < Ω R < 10 , 0.1 < Ω < 10 ), for example, that the extreme value of the scintillation index amplification factor occurs when Ω R ≃ 1 and Ω ≃ 1 . It can be seen that the phase perturbation in Eq. (13) is just the first-order complex phase perturbation associated with the folded-path integrals, and the final forms of E 2 r 1 , r 2 and E 3 r 1 , r 2 are equivalent to the ones in reference [13], which also proves the validity of our derivation. However, derivation in this paper is much easier to understand and is more consistent with the method used in the case of mirror reflection.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.105,Comparative research on characteristics of light absorbers of metal-dielectric and metal photonic crystal transmission grating,"Abstract Using nanofabricated Si3N4 nanohole array photonic crystal grating, an Au metal-dielectric resonance grating by spin-coating Au on the Si3N4 nanohole array photonic crystal grating is investigated. Optical properties and related characteristics of metal-dielectric grating light absorber and meal grating light absorber are compared and analyzed. We simulate transmittances corresponding to different grating periods of the metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating in visible-infrared light region and display electric field distributions in the vicinity of nanoholes at different incident wavelengths by using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) software with broadband light source 400 nm–1100 nm.The mechanism of absorption generation in the metal-dielectric and metal transmission grating is analyzed and discussed in this paper. The Au structure of metal photonic crystal transmission grating is also investigated for light absorber. The metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating structure absorbs more than 90% of the incident light at absorption point wavelength.",Apr-18," Keywords Absorber FDTD Transmission Surface Plasmon resonance Electric field distribution 1 Introduction In 1902, R. W. Wood observed anomalous absorption in metal structure [1]. Then, related researches about light absorption in structured metal arise gradually in 1960s, 1970s and 1990s [2–4]. Recently, a multiplexed metal structure light absorber based on the two different size gold square in each unit cell has been proposed [5]. The principle of absorbers and filters in this paper is the excitation of surface Plasmon polaritons [8]. When light is incident to the interface of metal and dielectric, free electrons distributed on the metal surface will be excited and generate oscillation, which results to form surface Plasmas. Large photon energy are transformed to free electrons’ oscillation energy due to electronic oscillation generated on the metal surface and the energy of reflectivity declines sharply, which results to strong absorption of incident light power. However, it is rare to propose the transmitted device as an absorber that can absorb optical frequency electromagnetic wave. In many applications, optical absorber has a good prospect that it can be applied in areas such as solar cell, sensor, optical filter, optical waveguide, THz imager and thermal radiation detection [9–14]. Compared with the traditional absorbers, the characteristic of this structure is transmission grating rather than reflective grating. In this letter, the relationship between wavelength and transmission of the two structures and each electronic field distribution is investigated respectively. Transmittance of this structure is approximately close to zero at a certain wavelength in the range of 600 nm–900 nm, which means light power can be absorbed completely when light is incident through the transmission grating at a certain wavelength. Electric field distribution is simulated to discuss the absorption generation. The intensity of electric field at absorption wavelength in transmission grating is much lower than other wavelength because there is no resonance existing so that much light is reflected and rare light is transmitted. The peak transmission is caused by surface Plasmon resonance. We compare and analyze optical characteristics of the light absorber of metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating and the light absorber of Au nanohole array transmission grating under the incident light source in visible-infrared region. 2 Methods and calculation The range of incident light wavelength is set as 400–1100 nm due to both of two photonic crystal grating investigation going under visible-infrared light region. Fig. 1 (a) shows the light absorber structure of metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating. The device is made of a nanohole array grating etched through a gold film and a silicon nitride film deposited on a glass substrate. The diameter of the nanoholes is 240 nm. The thickness of silicon nitride is 250 nm and the thickness of gold film is 60 nm [5]. We choose nanohole grating to be convenient for observing obvious surface Plasmon resonance phenomenon by observing the intensity of electronic field. We take a series of examples of different periods of nanohole arrays such as 250 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm respectively, which is suitable for light diffraction. Columns of nanoholes are corresponding to grating lines that provide angular dispersion and diffraction for measuring the resonance spectra of the device. Fig. 1(b) shows structure of metal (Au) nanohole array transmission grating. The gold film thickness, nanoholes’ size, period of nanoholes arrangement and the change of period is the same as the structure of Fig. 1(a) for comparison convenience. Difference of 1(a) and 1(b) is whether silicon nitride layer exists or not. Both of these two fabrications can be accomplished by electron beam lithography. We use finite-difference time domain (FDTD) software (Lumerical Solutions, Inc.) to simulate and calculate the two structures. Designed light absorber of metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating and Au nanohole array transmission grating is both in the visible and near-infrared wave region. A Johnson-Christy material model based on measurement data is used for the electric permittivity of the gold film [6]. The optical constant of the magnesium fluoride is obtained from [7]. The condition boundary is set as periodic boundary conditions in the lateral direction. In the directions of propagation and transmission, the simulation domain is terminated with perfect matching layers. The incident light is normal incidence from the glass substrate into the device with a broadband light source 400 nm–1100 nm. Fig. 2 shows the calculated power transmittance of metal dielectric structure with different grating periods. Fig. 3 shows the transmittance in Au nanohole array transmission grating structure with periods of 250 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm. In Fig. 2, it’s clearly that the whole transmittance in the nanohole period of 500 nm or 600 nm is obviously lower than the transmittance in the period of 250 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm. There is a peak value and minimum value in every curve. It can be seen that the transmittance minimum value is found at the region of wavelength 600–800 nm. The total trend of transmission is lower. We calculate the minimum value of transmittance is 0.2855 at 602.02 nm, 0.0876 at 642.242 nm, 0.0085 at 804.04 nm, 0.0075 at 783.838 nm and 0.0017 at 682.828 nm corresponding to the grating periods of 250 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm, 500 nm and 600 nm respectively. These values of absorption points are very close to 0 which means rare of light pass through the grating because most of light is reflected at absorption. Most of light pass through the grating because reflectivity is too small caused by surface Plasmon resonance to maximize the transmittance resulting to peak value. In general, the wavelength of light absorption point moves towards longer wavelength because of the lowest point of transmittance towards to longer wavelength. Especially, the transmittance decreases and the lowest point of transmission becomes smaller when the period of grating increases. Metal-dielectric grating structure absorbs more than 90% of incident light at the absorption point. Fig. 3 shows the transmittance in Au nanohole array transmission grating structure with periods of 250 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm. From this picture, the wavelength of light absorption point moves towards to longer wavelength. Compared to Fig. 2, the lowest point of transmittance in metal grating structure is higher than the metal-dielectric grating structure, which means metal grating structure absorbs less light than metal-dielectric. The lowest transmittance point with period of 250 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm is 0.3021, 0.2096, 0.0127, 0.0017and 0.0012 respectively corresponding to the wavelength of 626.913 nm, 610.797 nm, 680.802 nm, 783.838 nm, 935.433 nm respectively. We calculate the electric field intensity distribution in the middle plane over the nanohole Au layer (20 nm above the surface of gold metal layer) in the unit cell of the metal-dielectric absorber structure with the a certain grating period. We take the lowest total transmittance curve of period 500 nm as an example. Fig. 4 (a) shows the electric field intensity distribution calculated with the light wavelength of 643 nm, a peak wavelength in the visible wavelength region of the wide absorption band. It can be seen that the center of the hole exhibits local field enhancement and electric field interference between holes. The surface Plasmon resonance generates on the metal. Fig. 4(b) shows the electric field intensity distribution at the wavelength of 783 nm—the absorption point wavelength. The electric field intensity of center of hole is weaker than Fig. 4(a). The electric field intensity distribution in Fig. 4 shows clearly that the Plasmon resonance mode in the structure of Fig. 4(a). The electric field intensity distribution in the middle plane over the nanohole Au layer (20 nm above the surface of gold metal layer) in the unit cell of the gold metal absorber structure with the period of 500 nm is also calculated. Fig. 5 (a), (b) shows the electric field intensity distribution calculated at wavelength of 700 nm (peak point), 794 nm (absorption point) respectively. Compared with Fig. 3, the electric field at absorption point is weak in nanoholes and the electric field at peak point exhibits good surface Plasmon resonance and local field enhancement. 3 Discussion and analysis In this paper, we simulate two structures of grating as light absorber by analyzing their transmittance and both of two optical characteristics are researched respectively. For exploring the relationship between optical property and different periods of nanohole array grating lines, transmittances under different periods of the two grating is measured. The transmittance in the nanohole photonic transmission grating generates a minimum transmittance at a certain wavelength closed to 0 resulting to the light absorber could be made. The transmittance in different periods of nanohole grating lines is various. In Fig. 2, transmittance in both structures keeps a tendency of reduction and the minimum of transmission is lower with the increasing of periods. The reason why transmittance is decreasing with increasing of periods is not clearly explained in recent year researches, but it is related with the depth of nanoholes according [15]. Especially when the grating period is 500 nm, the transmittance in whole wavelength 400–1100 nm keeps low related to the metal and dielectric material properties. As it is seen that absorption at certain wavelengths clearly improves with longer grating, which we can infer that the performance of light absorber is better with the increasing of grating period. It is significant for light absorber or filter fabrication. The reason why it appears is inferred that the reflectivity of light incident onto the interface of metal and dielectric increases due to the unit cell area of light touching increasing for distance between each nanoholes grating line increasing, which result to transmittance decreases. There is always existing transmittance peak in every curve of Figs. 2 and 3 because of surface Plasmon resonance and their peak value also moves to longer wavelength just like the adsorption point. It is beneficial for fabricating different certain wavelength light absorber or opical filter. The electric field distribution can express the reason of adsorption point generation. Peak wavelength is in the frequency range of surface Plasmon polaritons so that photon power is absorbed completely caused by surface Plasmon resonance and the reflectivity is almost eliminated. Compared with Figs. 4 and 5 respectively, the center electric field intensity of (a) exhibit strong local field enhancement in the hole, it means surface Plasmon resonance occurs at peak points. The position where surface Plasmon resonance generates is on the interface of metal and dielectric. In Figs. 4(b) and Fig. 5(b), electric field intensity of absorption point at the center of nanoholes of transmission grating structure exhibit week electric field. We infer that reflection is strong at adsorption wavelength resulting to light transmission declining sharply and adsorption wavelength frequency is far away from frequency of surface Plasmon polaritons so that no surface Plasmon resonance generates in the nanoholes. These values of absorption points in transmittance picture are very close to 0 which means most of light is absorbed by the device and rare light can be transmitted. Compared with metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating and Au metal nanohole transmission grating, the integral transmittance of gold metal structure is higher than metal-dielectric structure including the absorption wavelength point. Metal-dielectric grating structure absorbs more than 90% of incident light compared with gold metal grating structure. The metal-dielectric nanohole photonic crystal transmission grating is more suitable than Au metal nanohole transmission grating for being applied in light absorber and optical filter. 4 Conclusion In summary, using FDTD software, we have calculated the transmittance of the light absorber structure of metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating and a light absorber structure of Au metal nanohole transmission grating verse grating period in the visible-infrared light region. The electric field intensity distribution of the two structures under a certain wavelength with the grating period of 500 nm is analyzed combined with optical characteristic transmission. The advantage of metal-dielectric nanohole photonic crystal grating is obvious compared with Au nanohole photonic crystal grating. The integral transmittance of gold metal structure is higher than metal-dielectric structure including the absorption wavelength point. Metal-dielectric grating structure absorbs more than 90% of incident light compared with gold metal grating structure. The demonstrated light absorber of metal-dielectric photonic crystal transmission grating can be applied for future applications in enhanced optical sensing and imaging.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.159,Global calibration of non-overlapping cameras: State of the art,"Abstract Multi-camera vision systems (MVS) have a larger field of view than a single camera and are often applied to acquire geometric information of large-scale objects or scenes. Data integration from multiple cameras is a very important part for vision systems which is usually solved by using a global calibration method. After installing the MVS, in some cases, cameras do not have a common field of view (CFV) or only a narrow CFV. Accurate global calibration of cameras with non-overlapping field of view (FOV) is a very challenging task. A variety of global calibration of non-overlapping multi-camera methods (GCNM) have been proposed to estimate the relative positions and orientations of cameras based on different types of media or techniques such as large-range measuring devices, large-scale calibration targets, optical mirrors, motion model, laser projection, visual measuring instruments, etc. However, the GCNM is not yet a completely solved problem. Choosing which type of GCNM method to use is highly dependent on the specific vision system. Thus, in this paper, we present a comparative review of different GCNM methods and analyze accuracy, range, defects, and applications. Researchers and developers can take it as background information for their future works.",Apr-18," Keywords Global calibration Multi-camera vision systems Non-overlapping FOV 1 Introduction The visual system has the characteristics of non-contactness, rapid acquisition, high flexibility and high precision, so is widely used in various fields. The multi-camera vision system (MVS) is often used because it has larger measurement range than a single sensor. Camera calibration is an important task in 3D computer vision, especially when metric informations are required for applications involving accurate dimensional measurements. The global calibration of MVS is carried out to calculate the relative poses of the camera frames and the global coordinate frame (GCF). The measurement accuracy of MVS, as one of the most important technical indices, is directly influenced by the global calibration accuracy. In many applications of MVS, vision sensors may have no common FOV because some tasks require different cameras should shoot different parts of the object. As two adjacent cameras usually have no overlapping FOV or only a very small common FOV, the global calibration of MVS becomes an intractable problem. Most of the global calibration methods in the literatures are designed to calibrate the cameras with a common field of view. These methods rely on matching features in all sensor FOVs, which are not suitable for solving the case of non-overlapping FOVs. In order to overcome the limitations of non-overlapping FOV, many methods have been developed in recent years. Most of the non-overlapping FOV global calibration methods can be divided into 6 categories. • The first is based on large-range measuring devices; • The second is based on large-scale calibration targets; • The third is based on optical mirrors; • The fourth is based on the motion model; • The fifth is based on laser projection; • The seventh is based on visual measuring instruments. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 resumes the fundamentals of global calibration with non-overlapping views, and reviews a wide range of global calibration methods, Section 3 performs a comparative analysis according to the application requirements and discusses advantages and disadvantages, and finally, main conclusions are found in Section 4. 2 Methods of global calibration for non-overlapping cameras In most large-scale vision systems, a single camera can hardly cover all objects to be measured. Multiple cameras have the advantage of covering larger range. However, in MVS, it often happens that cameras have no common FOV. For example, as shown in Fig. 1 , four cameras are used to set up a vision system where there is no common FOV between every two cameras. Calibration of the system consist of two parts, firstly, intrinsic parameters of every camera need to be calibrated. A highly flexible technique to easily calibrate a camera has been proposed by Zhang [107] and widely used in various vision tasks. Secondly, the relative position parameters between different cameras should be calibrated accurately, which is the main purpose of global calibration. Theoretically, each camera's coordinate system needs to be transformed into the world coordinate system O w X w Y w Z w . In practical applications, one of the cameras (such as camera 2 as shown in Fig. 1) can be chosen as the basis of other cameras, after calculating the relative position of the other cameras relative to the base camera in the MVS, the position of each camera can be located. This is achieved by calculating the translation matrix T c i c 2 and the rotation matrix R c i c 2 . Eventually, the measurement data from each camera is fused to a common coordinate system. 2.1 Methods based on large-range measuring devices In order to ensure the accuracy of the global calibration, a high-precision measuring device can be adopted [7–11,13,108,109]. The most common large-range measuring devices are theodolites, laser trackers, and laser range finder. Lu and Li [8] develop a high precision global calibration method for large-scale visual measurement system using two theodolites. This method places a calibration target into the field of view of a camera, uses a theodolite coordinate measurement system (TCMS) to measure the 3D coordinates of the markers on the calibration target, and then calculates the positional relationship between the calibration target and the camera, and resolves the transformation matrix between the camera and TCMS. Lu used the visual system for straightness measurement of seamless steel tubes. The measurement test showed that the system could achieve a measurement accuracy of 0.06 mm in the range of 1500 mm. Another global calibration method is the use of laser tracker which has a higher accuracy and can replace the theodolite in many cases. Zhao et al. [108] described a global calibration method based on laser tracker. If the corresponding relationship between the 3D coordinates and the image points of all spots on a calibration board is known, the pose of the camera relative to the laser tracker can be resolved. The method achieves the measurement accuracy of 0.45 mm in the 8000 mm × 6000 mm working range. Kitahara et al. [7] presented a camera calibration technique for a large-scale space, such as a soccer stadium. Because there is not an enough large calibration board to cover the entire measurement space, they solved this global calibration problem by moving a calibration board to cover the whole area of the 3D space. Each position of the calibration board can be sensed by laser tracker and cameras simultaneously. Kitahara’s method provides a measurement error of less than 0.1 mm in large-scale space (e.g. 70m × 50 m with 25 m height). Laser range finder (LRF) is another high-precision measuring equipment for large-scale measurements. Liu et al. [10] proposed an external parameter calibration method for multiple cameras based on this device. The cameras capture the laser spots projected on the planar object and the LRF measures the distances between the different spots. The external parameters between different cameras can be computed according to the co-linearity of the laser spots captured by all the cameras at each LRF position and the distances between the laser spots. To solve the problem of non-overlapped views, the calibration of all the cameras can be achieved by pair-wise calibration. Liu’s method can method can achieve 0.3‰ relative error when the distance between the two cameras is around four meters. The method does not need any expensive high-precision 3D measurement equipment and high accuracy target, except a LRF and a planar object. It is simple to carry out and can achieve high accuracy, but this method will still be subject to certain light effects. Ortega et al. [11] presented a method of calibrating an outdoor distributed camera network having small or inexistent overlapping fields of view using LRF data. This method relies on a LRF data acquired and registered along the complete area of the network using SLAM methodologies. The method has a large measurement range and can be applied in person and robot detection localization, but has a lack of deeper evaluation of the precision and accuracy. With large-range devices such as theodolites, laser trackers, and LRF, 3D points of a plurality of calibration targets in a non-overlapping field of view can be easily obtained. Then the global calibration methods with high accuracy can be developed and already used in industrial visual inspection system. 2.2 Methods based on large-scale targets A calibration target is a workpiece with high precision and can be used for feature extraction and precision verification in camera calibration [14,15,19–21,23,25–28,32,81]. Planar calibration target is the most widely used calibration target, whose plane consistency is good, and features are easy to extract. Liu et al. [21] proposed a method to calibrate the vision system with non-overlapping field of view using a compound target consisting of two planar calibration targets which are fixed together, as shown in Fig. 2 . One vision sensor from MVS is selected as the global coordinate frame (GCF). The compound target is placed in front of the vision sensors for several (at least four) times. Using the constraint that the relative positions of all sub-targets are invariant, the transformation matrix from the coordinate frame of each vision sensor to GCF can be solved. The method does not require any high-precision 3D measurement device and shows that the RMS error of eight point pairs is 0.15 mm. This method has a high flexibility and can be applied to a variety of measurement environments. However, since the distance between the cameras is greater than the field of view of each camera, the pose change of the calibration target can not be too large so that the camera can view the corresponding sub-target, which results in instability of the calibration results. What is more, calibration images are also prone to defocusing. 1D target has the advantage of simple structure, light and portable. It can be manufactured to a large length, much larger than the size of 2D target. It has no occlusion, thus can be easily captured by multiple vision sensors. It is suitable for the calibration of MVS distributed in both large and small measurement fields [16,22,28,33]. Liu et al. [14] proposed a global calibration method for cameras with non-overlapping field of view based on 1D targets. The rotation matrix between adjacent cameras can be solved based on the collinearity of the feature points on the 1D target. The translation vector can be calculated according to the known distance of the feature points on the 1D target. The transformation from the coordinate frame of each vision sensor to a global coordinate frame can be obtained by repeating the pair-wise calibration on different pair of vision sensors. RMS error of this method is within 0.060 mm. Franca et al. [17] also used 1D target for global calibration. The cameras are divided into binocular sets. The fundamental matrix of each binocular set is then estimated, allowing to perform a projective calibration of each camera. Then, the calibration is updated for the Euclidean space. In order to achieve high accuracy, the length of the 1D target should be proportional to the distance between the sensors. With the number of images more than 50, the error obtained in the estimation of the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters was around 0.5%. The non-absolute linearity of the 1D target and the extraction error of the calibration point will affect the overall calibration accuracy. In order to solve the problem of non-overlapping fields of view, 1D targets can be connected for global calibration. Xie et al. [27] proposed a method to calibrate the relative position and orientation relationship between two cameras with non-overlapping field of view. Firstly a rough estimation of the relative pose of the two cameras was given using the invariant constraints on the angle and distance between two short 1D bars, then changing the distances between light spots on the two 1D bars respectively to refine the estimation of the relative pose parameters and the structure parameter of the targets. The experimental calibration shows that the system calibrated by this method reaches an accuracy of 0.108 mm when measuring a distance section of 1040 mm. This method provides a flexibility and tight space advantage compared to other calibration methods. If there are more cameras, only two cameras can be calibrated at a time, which makes the calibration method complicated to be realized. 2.3 Methods based on optical mirrors Mirror-based method has been successfully used for the calibration of extrinsic parameters by using the reflection characteristics of the optical mirror [12,34–52,83]. This method overcomes the limitation that all cameras must observe the common target directly and allows the camera to observe the target indirectly through the mirror. Sturm and Bonfort et al. [36] used a plane mirror to estimate the target's pose with respect to the camera for the case where the camera has no direct view of the object. The views of the reflected object are treated as if they were direct views. The method computes a camera pose from the camera’s calibration and the given point correspondences, and then gets the pose of virtual cameras relative to the object, followed by estimating the positions of the planar mirrors. The result shows that the approximate diameter of the reconstructed part of the platter was 80 mm, resulting in a 0.3% relative error in the reconstruction. Robot pose estimation plays an important role in robot vision system with non-overlapped views. Transformation between a camera and the body of the robot need to be calibrated. Hesch et al. [37] proposed a method of estimating the six-degrees-of-freedom transformation between a camera and the body of the robot. The method requires calibration between a camera and robot body using planar mirror. The robot maneuvers in front of a planar mirror, allowing the camera to observe fiducial features on the robot from several vantage points. The measurements collected are processed in a maximum-likelihood estimator, which produces estimates for the camera-to-robot transformation, as well as for the mirror configuration in each of the images. One of the key advantages of the method is its ease of use. But this method requires that the coordinates of the points on the robot-body frame must be known a priori. Lebraly et al. [39] proposed a calibration method for two non-overlapping cameras embedded on a vehicle, for visual navigation purpose in urban environment. The method does not require knowing the scene geometry and uses visual markers stuck on the mirror surface in order to initialize nonlinear equations. After the minimization, the standard deviation of re-projection error is 0.14 pixel. These results are satisfying for mobile robot applications. Xu et al. [40] used planar calibration plates and planar mirrors to calibrate a system consisting of four non-overlapping field-of-view cameras. The proposed method involves calibrating the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, solving a set of transformation relationships between the other cameras, including the mirrored virtual camera, and the global central camera chosen. Through global calibration by this method, a displacement of 1100 mm by a high-accuracy motor-driven moving platform is measured, with the standard deviation 0.074 mm. Agrawal et al. [42] proposed a method of external parameter calibration based on a single reflection of a spherical mirror whose radius is known. The position of the spherical mirror and the external parameters can be solved at the same time. The method does not require knowing the position of the spherical mirror and that the boundary of the spherical mirror is visible in the image, simply by using the projection of the 3D reference point. Therefore, the method is simple and practical. Note that the 2D projections are confined to a significantly smaller pixel area for the spherical mirror, which may affect the calibration results to some extent. For small systems with a small number of cameras, the mirror-based approach is relatively simple to use. But for large-scale measurement systems, this method faces some challenges. First, as the distance from the camera increases, the image of the reference object becomes smaller, resulting in a decrease in accuracy. Second, the placement of the mirror is a problem often overlooked, and sometimes theoretically it is difficult to ensure that multiple cameras can, directly and indirectly, observe the target. 2.4 Methods based on structure from motion (SFM) SFM has been used to calibrate multiple cameras [53–73]. This method tracks the movement of people on the ground or other targets, to establish the corresponding relationship of different camera field of view. All motion-based methods are inspired by Caspi and Irani [53], and assume that the motion of the target can compensate for the lack of image correspondence points, with the exception of the use of target motions. Esquivel et al. [59] proposed a method for calibrating non-overlapping dual cameras based on the motion consistency of rigid links. This method uses two internally calibrated non-overlapping cameras to synchronously capture a sequence of images for calibration of the camera's external parameters. The method calculates the motion of the camera independently, and uses the similarity transformation to arrange all reconstructions. However, this method is not suitable for calibrating cameras that do not meet motion compliance requirements. Each camera captures an individual sequence which is afterwards processed by a SFM algorithm resulting in positions and orientations for each camera. The unknown relative transformations between the rigidly coupled cameras are estimated utilizing the rigidity constraint of the rig. Lébraly et al. [65] proposed a method for the calibration of non-overlapping cameras embedded on a vehicle, for visual navigation purpose in urban environment. The calibration procedure consists in manoeuvring the vehicle while each camera observes a static scene. Lébraly carried out a study of the singular motions and a specific bundle adjustment which both reconstructs the scene and calibrates the cameras. Solutions to handle the singular configurations, such as planar motions, are exposed. The method provides errors below 0.5 mm for the translation, and about 0.01° for the rotation. Anjum et al. [66] developed a method to estimate relative position of non-overlapping cameras. The method estimates the missing trajectory information in the unobserved areas of the multi-sensor configuration using both parametric and non-parametric algorithms. First, Kalman filtering is used to estimate the trajectories in the unobserved regions. Next, linear regression estimates the position of the target based upon the motion model generated from the measured positions in the field of view of each sensor. Finally, the relative orientation of the sensors is calculated using the observed and estimated target position from adjacent cameras. The performance of the algorithm was demonstrated on a set of real and synthetic data in networks of N = 3, N = 4 and N = 8 cameras. Their experiments showed that for a network of N = 4 non-overlapping sensors the average location estimation error is approximately 1% of the size of the scene and this error is further reduced to 0.75% for a N = 8 sensors network. Micusik et al. [71] solved a relative pose problem for non-overlapping surveillance cameras with known gravity vector. The method shows how to tackle the problem of missing point correspondences heavily required by SFM pipelines and how to go beyond this basic paradigm. The error of 0.38 m in center estimation and 5° in rotation for the method at the camera distance of 10m is obtained for the video surveillance. The above calibration methods based on structure from motion do not require a high-precision measuring device, so it is relatively inexpensive and flexible, and is often used for robot navigation, visual tracking, video surveillance, etc. These methods require scene information, which is difficult to obtain in industrial measurement, and accuracy still need to be improved. 2.5 Methods based on laser projection Laser projection method has a larger measurement range and is less affected by light, so often used in the global calibration method [74–80]. As the laser pointer is small, portable, distance measurement accuracy, methods based on the laser projection are suitable for non-overlapping field of view of the calibration parameters. Liu et al. [76] proposed a method for multi-vision system calibration on point laser projector. The field of view of a non-overlapping camera is realized by passing the laser beam through the field of view of different cameras, and the external parameters of the multi-camera are solved according to the fact that the spot of the same laser beam is collinear. The method shows that the point pair distance RMS error of the calibrated measurement system is about 1.2 mm with respect to 1.1 m measurement range. This method is simple, low cost for large-scale, off-site parameter calibration and it’s operable in narrow space environment. However, it is difficult to ensure that each camera captures high-quality planar targets and spot images. Zou et al. [77,78] installed a laser pointer on a calibration target, and proposed a method of calibrating a camera pointing toward and away from the camera. This method is suitable for factories and garages. As long as the laser can pass through, even a narrow space, this method can also be used. At the same time, this method is not sensitive to a variety of lighting conditions. However, it is difficult to ensure that the laser direct projection in the optical center. The method provides the standard deviation is about 1 cm, and the average reprojection error is 2.1 mm. Liu et al. [74] proposed a global calibration method using oblique light as the target. The proposed method utilizes pairs of skew laser lines, which are generated by a group of laser pointers, as the calibration objects. Each pair of skew laser lines provides a unique coordinate system in space which can be reconstructed in certain vision sensor’s coordinates. This method is more flexible, the camera with different perspectives can be calibrated, but it’s difficult in practice. Since it is necessary to project the laser line to the field of view of each camera, a large number of line lasers are required when the number of cameras is large. The method provides the angle difference is less than 0.02° and the baseline difference is less than 0.5 mm. Compared with the laser line, the laser plane provides more information, increases the accuracy of feature extraction, laser plane can cover more space, and it’s more flexible and suitable for field calibration. The method in reference [75] utilizes several light planes, which can be generated by a line laser projector or a rotary laser level, as the calibration objects. The fact that local light planes available in different cameras are identical in global coordinates is used to recover the geometries. It should be noted that this method assumes that the laser plane is absolutely flat, which is different from the actual situation. This method improves the former accuracy and provides angle difference is less than 0.01° and the baseline difference is less than 0.2 mm. 2.6 Methods based on visual measuring instruments If the spatial coordinates of multiple feature points and the internal parameters of the camera are known, the camera's external parameters can be solved by a single image captured by the camera. The spatial coordinates of the feature points can be obtained by using the technique of 3D reverse engineering. Thus, vision-based measurement devices such as close-range photogrammetry systems and hand-held scanners can be used for global calibration of non-overlapping cameras [87–90]. The close-range photogrammetry, one of the most important methods for modeling large-scale 3D objects and scenes, has served as a key solution to the extrinsic calibration of cameranet works. In the field of close-range photogrammetry, it is common to use easily identifiable encoded targets for multi-view matching of unordered image sets because there are seldom sufficient feature points on the surface of an object. Dong et al. [87] proposed a method for extrinsic calibration of a non-overlapping camera network based on close-range photogrammetry. As Fig. 3 shows, this method does not need to calibrate the target or camera. The method is carried out by reconstructing the three-dimensional coordinate points of the coded targets directly with a hand-held camera, and then calibrates the camera's internal parameters. Finally, each camera uses an image to calibrate the external parameters. The experimental results show that the method is simple and that the relative error for the 3D reconstruction is smaller than 0.003%, the relative errors of both rotation and translation are less than 0.066%, and the re-projection error is only 0.09 pixels. Bridal et al. [89] used a calibrator similar to the shape of the object to be measured, and then affixed enough reflective markings on it, and used the industrial close-range measurement method to obtain the 3D coordinates of these markers that are applied to the camera's global calibration. Results compared with the ATOS measurement show that the system can achieve 0.2 mm measurement accuracy, which indirectly proves that the global calibration accuracy of the system is high. Gong et al. [90] argued that it is important to find a suitable target for global calibration of non-overlapping multi-cameras. With the help of a hand-held scanner called REVscan that is a product of the Creaform company, the measured object can act directly as a calibrator without the need for additionally dedicated calibration targets. This method is very flexible and suitable for indoor or outdoor measurements. The experimental results show that the system achieves 0.1 mm measurement accuracy in the range of 1353 mm. Other works based on combined techniques are described in [91–106] to implement global calibration. 3 Discussion A comparison of calibration methods is presented in Table 1 in terms of accuracy, range, environmental influences, safety and economy. Some quantitative information is provided according to the referenced specific application. Methods based on large-range measuring device, large-scale calibration targets, and visual measuring instruments can provide acceptable accuracy under certain conditions for most applications. Many calibration methods need to be closer to the object as they have a short working distance except methods based on large-range measuring device and laser projection. Nowadays, many lightweight commercial instruments combined with these methods can also be used for global calibration. All methods are not dangerous for people, with the exception of some high power lasers that are not eye-safe. Table 2 compares advantages and disadvantages of the reviewed methods for global calibration. The calibration method based on a large-range of devices has a large operating range, enabling wide calibration of the cameras in wide-area distribution while maintaining high accuracy. However, due to the need for special devices such as laser trackers and theodolites, which are more expensive and relatively heavy, the cost of this method is particularly high and it is not convenient to move those devices. The method based on large-scale target is often used for global calibration because the method has the advantages of low cost and moderate precision. However, this method requires complex optimization algorithms and that multiple cameras can simultaneously capture multiple images of the target, and puts forward higher requirements for the design and placement of the target. The optical mirror-based calibration method requires only mirrors and calibration target, so the cost is not high. But the relatively small imaging area of calibration target in the mirror and the constrained placement of the target affect the accuracy of calibration. Calibration method based on structure from motion can work in long distance and does not require high-precision measurement device, so the cost is not high. But this method requires the support of the scene information, which is harsh for industrial measurements. In addition, the state of motion will influence the accuracy of calibration. Methods based on laser projection can provide moderate accuracy but are dangerous for people as some laser classes (high power) are not eye-safe. The method based on visual measuring instruments is a kind of great potential global calibration method because of its high precision and good flexibility. There are many commercial high-precision visual measuring instruments available, but the price of these instruments is not low. Table 3 summarizes the references of global calibration methods grouped by several kinds of applications. In the survey, main applications of global calibration are in the field of 3D reconstruction, visual track, parameter measurement and pose estimation. The global calibration method based on the large-range device is mainly used for the geometric parameter measurement of large objects because of the high precision and large measuring range. The global calibration method based on large-scale target has a good compromise in terms of cost and accuracy due to the need for simple auxiliary targets. Therefore, this method has a very wide range of applications, especially for geometric parameter measurement. The mirror-based global calibration method is also a less costly approach, more suitable for the visual systems where the distribution of the cameras is relatively sparse but the cameras changes greatly in orientation. The method based on structure from motion is rarely used for industrial measurement due to the lack of scene information support and low precision, but has a wide range of applications in visual tracking, pose estimation and robot navigation. The method based on laser projection can theoretically work in a large range, but it is difficult to obtain high calibration accuracy because the image quality of the spot or the light plane decays as the work distance increases. Therefore, this method is more often used for visual tracking tasks, or applied to some tasks of the parameters measurement where accuracy requirements are not considered first. The method based on the visual measuring instrument can reconstruct the three-dimensional model of arbitrary target according to the distribution of cameras. Thus, no matter how complicated the structure of the MVS is, it is theoretically possible to construct a stereoscopic target whose shape is close to the object to be measured. This method demonstrates very good adaptability and is a global calibration solution with great potential for application. In fact, many 3D vision techniques can be used for global calibration. Wilson [105] reviews 3D vision techniques and solutions in a literature with commercial purposes providing a list of applications and manufacturers. Sets of questions and advises are presented in [106] in order to help the reader to choose the right 3D vision technique for their project. Global calibration should be carried out with flexibility and accuracy in more complex and diverse tasks, such as reconstruction of complex objects and moving objects during navigation, collaborative work with humans, fine positioning, inspection, etc. In all the reviewed applications, each global calibration method has its single purpose. This is because requirements of each task are quite different and each technique has its scope and is more adequate than others. 4 Conclusion The calibration of the cameras is a fundamental task as well as a key part of MVS. The global calibration of cameras with non-overlapping FOV has a wide range of applications, but also is a tricky problem that has not yet been fully solved. This paper summarizes the different methods widely used in global calibration of non-overlapping FOV in the MVS. An excellent global calibration method should have the following characteristics, such as high precision, good adaptability, low cost, easy operation, and so on. However, it is very difficult to satisfy the above characteristics at the same time, especially for MVS with non-overlapping FOV. This article provides a detailed analysis of the accuracy, adaptability, and application of each method. Choosing which type of global calibration method depends entirely on the structure and task requirements of the vision system to be calibrated. With the advancement of optical technology and the reduction of the price of high-precision commercial equipment, the global calibration methods will become more and more diversified and convenient in the future.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.017,Investigation of achromatic micro polarizer array for polarization imaging in visible-infrared band,"Abstract The design and fabrication of a micro polarizer array (MPA) for polarization imaging is described for visible-IR region. The MPA, composed of 1280 × 1024 elements, is designed to be integrated directly onto the CMOS chip. Each micro polarizer consists of a 200-nm-period Al wire grating with the dimension of 5.2 μm × 5.2 μm, and the performance of gratings with finite number of periods and gradient ridge-length has been thoroughly investigated. The grating ridge of each polarizer orients four different directions offset by 45°, which determines different polarization directions correspondingly. Initial test and experiment for the MPA are performed and the crosstalk caused by diffraction is discussed.",Apr-18," Keywords Polarimetric imaging Micro polarizer array Subwavelength gratings 1 Introduction To compensate human eyes’ inability of identifying the polarization information, conventional imaging systems are designed to capture the intensity and wavelength information, when the polarization characteristic of the light is unfortunately ignored. Polarization is, however, an indispensable nature of light which indicates the vector information of the optical field. There are significant different polarization states of radiated and scattering light from different objects, or from the same object at different conditions. Analyzing the polarization images will bring us additional information, such as surface features, shape, shading, and roughness, which cannot be obtained from the conventional intensity image [1]. As a result, by taking into account of the polarization characteristics of light, it is possible to improve the ability of information acquisition and analysis. And capturing the polarization properties has proven to be beneficial in diverse applications, such as haze/foggy imaging [2], underwater imaging [3], material identification [4], non-contact fingerprint detection [5] and so on. Generally, existing polarization imaging systems include the following categories: division of time polarimeters [6], division of amplitude polarimeters [7], division of aperture polarimeters [8], and division of focal plane polarimeters [9,10]. The micro polarizer array polarimeter [11–14], a kind of division of focal plane polarimeters, is characterized with real time, high reliability and stability, but low power consumption. Each micro-polarizer of the MPA is essentially a sub-wavelength metal grating which obtains polarization variations of the light [15]. Compared with the traditional polarizers, subwavelength metal gratings have much broader spectral width and smaller volume. Due to their superiorities of small size, compact structure, and easy to be integrated, subwavelength metal gratings can replace the traditional optical polarimeters to reduce the optical components and increase system flexibility in the optical system [16]. The advantage of the polarizing imaging device based on micro polarizer array in terms of volume, weight, power consumption, has greatly promoted the application field of polarization imaging. The micro-polarizer array is designed to be integrated on the CMOS photosensitive chip. The size of the micro-polarizer array is exactly the same as that of the chip, and the micro-polarizer array is aligned strictly pixel to pixel with the chip. In a 2 × 2 unit of the MPA, as is shown in Fig. 1 , the polarization direction of the micro-polarizer is different from each other, which is decided by the orientation of the ridges: 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°. Therefore, in the image captured by the camera, each pixel in a 2 × 2 unit records the intensity of light passing through polarization analyzer of a certain polarization direction. The advantage of the micro-polarizer array is that it can acquire images of four different polarization directions by simply acquiring one single-frame image. 2 Design For subwavelength metal gratings [17], whose period is less than the wavelength of incident light, the traditional scalar diffraction theory is no longer suitable. Instead, the vector diffraction theory is used for detailed analysis of subwavelength structures. Some widely-used vector diffraction theories include Finite Element Method (FEM) [18], Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) [19], Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) [20], and so on. Furthermore, some approximate analysis can be performed by the equivalent media theory [21], which can reflect the working principle of the grating polarization characteristic intuitively. Equivalent media theory is to replace the periodic structure with a layer of uniform medium. The periodic grating is regarded as a homogeneous medium, meanwhile, the entire electric field within the grating can be seen as uniform. According to the Maxwell equation boundary condition, the equivalent refractive index of equivalent dielectric layer for TM polarized light and TE polarized light is [22] (1) n T E = f n 2 2 + 1 - f n 1 2 1 2 (2) n T M = f n 2 - 2 + 1 - f n 1 - 2 - 1 2 in which n 1 , n 2 are the refractive index of air and the grating medium respectively, f is the duty cycle, and f = w / p, w is the width of the grating, p is the grating period. For metal gratings, n 2 = n + i *k, where n and k denote the refractive index and extinction coefficient of the metal, respectively. For different duty cycles f, the equivalent refractive index of TM polarized light and TE polarized light is different. Therefore, the grating exhibits polarization characteristic, that is, the incident TE polarized light (whose polarization direction is parallel to the grating ridge) is reflected, and the incident TM polarized light (whose polarization direction is perpendicular to the grating) is transmitted. The essence of this phenomenon is that the TE polarized light can excite the electrons of the nanowires to generate current, and is consequently reflected. While, due to the presence of the air gap between the nanowires, current cannot be excited by the TM polarized light, resulting in the transmission. The equivalent dielectric theory is utilized to understand the polarization characteristics of metal gratings and perform the preliminary parameter design. Transmittance is the most important parameter to evaluate the performance of gratings, which reflects the utilization of the grating for light energy. The rate depends on the parameters of the grating itself and the incident light. The incident light is decided by its wavelength, angle of incidence, and polarization state. Main parameters of gratings are grating period, grating groove parameters, surface roughness, grating materials. For polarized gratings, there is one more parameter to evaluate the polarization effect, that is the extinction ratio [23]. Extinction ratio is defined as the transmission rate of TE wave divided by the transmission rate of TM wave. To achieve high transmittance and high extinction ratio, it is necessary to optimize the parameters of the grating, in which the groove parameters are the most important factors affecting the transmittance and extinction ratio. The preliminary simulation and optimization of the structures are performed using the FDTD method. To calculate 3-dimensional models with a large simulation area, FDTD method is chosen because of its advantages of time-saving and accuracy. Aluminum is used for its characteristic of easy processing and the simulated Al wire gratings are positioned on top of an infinite silica slab. Spectral responses were calculated using normal incidence plane wave excitation at a wavelength of 630 nm and tabulated dielectric functions for both aluminum and silica [24]. Fig. 2 presents the simulation results of Al wire gratings illuminated by normally incident light at 630 nm for varying grating period (p), duty cycle (f) and groove depth (d). The groove depth is fixed to be 160 nm in Fig. 2(a) and (b), while in (c) and (d) the duty cycle is set to be 0.4. In Fig. 2(a) -Fig. 2(d), the transmittance and the extinction ratio decline with the raise of the grating period, which means the smaller period the better. However, considering the difficulty of the fabrication of structures with a too small period, the period is finally chosen to be around 200 nm. As can be seen from Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), with the increase of the duty cycle f, there is an obvious decrease of transmittance but a clear growth of the extinction ratio at the same time. Consequently, a centered value of duty factor, such as 0.4 or 0.5, is selected to get a transmittance larger than 0.8 and a high extinction ration larger than 100. In Fig. 2(c), there is no clear connection between transmittance and groove depth, while in Fig. 2(d), having a larger groove depth will get a better extinction ratio, and the depth should therefore be over 140 nm to feed the need. Thus, considering all above factors, the period, groove depth and duty cycle are finally determined as 200 nm, 160 nm and 0.4 respectively. Fig. 3 presents the calculated spectra for the designed grating at the wavelength from 500 nm to 1200 nm. The transmittance is larger than 0.8 and the extinction ratio is over 100, which achieve our requirement perfectly. The calculations above are for infinite periodic structures, but the target structure cannot be extended infinitely. The size of the micro-polarizer array is designed to be the same with that of the CMOS chip. A chip consists of 1280 × 1024 pixels, and the size of each pixel is 5.2 μm × 5.2 μm. Since the grating period designed is 200 nm, a basic unit consisting of horizontal or vertical (0° or 90°) ridges will have 26 periods. And for the unit consisting of oblique (45° or 135°) ridges, the periods number is 36. Thus, Al wire gratings with various finite periods are simulated at the wavelength of 630 nm. As is shown in Fig. 4 , the grating of smaller number of cycles does not exhibit good polarization characteristics with low maximum transmittance and low extinction ratio. While, it performs well when the period number reaches 20 or more, and the polarization performance of the grating with 26 periods can be comparable to that of the infinite periodic structure. Furthermore, the structure with oblique ridges is also calculated, with grading length of the ridge strips, unlike straight gratings with stable length. Fig. 5 presents the similar trend with Fig. 4. Gratings with oblique grating ridges achieve the requirements of polarization characteristics with the periods number over 20. Hence the 5.2 × 5.2 μm oblique grating with 36 periods can meet the requirements. But when the period number is the same, the performance of oblique gratings is not as good as that of straight gratings. 3 Experiment The micro polarizer array was fabricated on a fused silica substrate. First a 160 nm thick layer of aluminum was evaporated using DC sputtering. This was followed by an e-beam evaporation of SiO2 that acts as a hard mask for aluminum etching [25,26]. For the electron beam exposure, the sample was coated with ZEP7000 electron beam resist. The micro polarizer array with different line orientations was then exposed using Raith (former Vistec) EBPG 5000 + HR system. The exposed resist was then developed in ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP) and rinsed in Isopropanol and DI-water. The pattern in the resist was then transferred to SiO2 layer and finally to aluminum using reactive ion etching. Fig. 6 (a) presents the SEM photos of the 1080 × 1024 MPA. The overall structure matches the design perfectly, with each pixel of 5.2 μm × 5.2 μm. The width of the grating ridge is 10 nm wider than expected, because of the fabrication error. A reference polarizer with the dimension of 5 mm × 5 mm is also fabricated to do characterization, since there is no effective method to do transmittance measurement though a micro structure of 5.2 μm × 5.2 μm, as is shown in Fig. 6(b). The reference structure is Al wire grating with only one ridge orientation, and the structural parameters are the same with the designed grating. The optical parameters were measured by a ellipsometry (J. A. Woolam). A comparison between experimental data and calculated data is made in Fig. 7 . The maximum transmittance of the grating is about 0.6 during the wavelength from 500 nm to1200 nm, and the extinction ratio is about 100, which meets the usual commercial standards, though both data are lower than calculated results. Imaging experiments were performed using a black and white visible light CMOS camera. Object light reaches the CMOS window through the imaging lens and the MPA polarizer, and the protective case of the CMOS is removed in order to get a close contact between the polarizer and the CMOS chip. Fig. 8 presents polarized images taken by the reference polarizer. The object is a polarization testing pattern for polarized glasses, as is shown in Fig. 8(a), which is shot without the polarizer. There is a fish pattern with polarization selectivity in the red box, which is distinguished from the background. But the fish cannot be revealed in Fig. 8(a), because the fish and the background have the same light intensity in the natural light. The reference polarizer is rotated in front of the CMOS. With the polarizer rotating, the background intensity stays at the same level while the fish pattern will become bright and dark according to the rotation angle. The angle when the fish becomes brightest is defined as 0°, and it becomes darkest after the polarizer rotating by 90°. The contrast between the fish image and the background is not obvious when the polarizer is rotated by 45° or 135°, because they have similar intensity at this time. This phenomenon shows that, compared with the background, the fish pattern has an obvious polarizing effect depending on the incident light. And the polarizer presents good polarizability. To get the experiment photos photographed with the MPA polarizer, each micro-polarizer of the MPA needs to be strictly aligned with each pixel of the CMOS chip. Pixel images which are taken by the same kind of micro-polarizer are extracted to form four final pictures, and the processing is presented in Fig. 9 (a). Pixel images obtained with 0° polarizers are marked with “I”, and they are extracted from the original picture to form an image which can be regarded as photographed with a 0°-polarizer. Fig. 9(b) presents the processed four pictures, which, however, shows no obvious polarization effect. There should be no problem of the gratings, since experiments of the reference polarizer have shown the expected performance. Two reasons are responsible for the failure of the experiment. One possible reason is the inaccurately alignment of the system. To get a good experiment performance, each micro polarizer should be strictly aligned with a corresponding pixel of the CMOS chip as designed. And that means the adjustment precision of the system should be accurate to micron level, which is beyond the equipment condition of our laboratory. While another reason may be the strong crosstalk caused by diffraction [27,28]. A pixel of Al gratings can be seen as a rectangle polarizer. Diffraction occurs when light passes through a polarizer, and the further the transmission distance is, the more obvious the diffraction phenomenon will be. Considering the thickness of the SiO2 base of the MPA, the glass protective layer of the CMOS and the air gap between these elements, the spacing between the MPA and the photosensitive chip of the CMOS is estimated to be 2–3 mm. The diffraction of the adjacent polarization will affect each other to produce crosstalk. In order to study the diffraction effect, the diffraction calculation model of a square hole is built. The side length of the square is 5.2 μm. A beam of plane wave light at the wavelength of 630 nm is incident on the model. The field distribution is calculated at a distance of 2 mm off the square hole, as is shown in Fig. 10 . The field intensity along the straight line through the center is also specifically calculated. Fig. 10 (a) presents a nearly circular distribution of the diffraction field with a radius of about 100 μm, far beyond the 5.2 μm boundary limit of the square hole. And the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the center optical filed is about 148 μm, calculated by the cross line at Fig. 10(b). The calculation result exhibits the strong influence of diffraction. The polarization of a micro polarizer has a significant effect on the surrounded polarizers within a radius of a dozen periods. As a result, there is no way to perform a good experiment for the MPA, since the performance of a polarizer if interfered and covered by others. It is known that there is a layer of micro lens at the surface of the CMOS, and the micro-polarizer array is designed to be integrated on the CMOS photosensitive chip, in the position between the photosensitive chip and the micro lens. Because of the focusing action of the micro lens, the crosstalk of the diffraction effect will be reduced. As a result, the following work is to explore the method of integrating the polarizer directly on the chip. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we have described the design and fabrication of a 1280 × 1024 MPA in visible-IR polarization imaging. The influence of the number of grating periods and grating shape on the polarization characteristics of the grating is discussed in detail. Each micro polarizer consists of a wire grating fabricated with Al on a SiO2 substrate. SEM evaluation indicates successful fabrication of the desired structures. The measurement result shows a maximum transmittance of 60% and an extinction ratio of about 100:1. The experiment of the reference group showed good polarization performance of the designed grating. The crosstalk caused by diffraction is analyzed. Future research will include integration of higher extinction-ratio wire grating structures into micro polarizer arrays, and efficient methods to integrate the MPA on a CMOS chip.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.093,Consistent neural network empirical physical formula constructions for nonlinear scattering intensities of dye-doped nematic liquid crystals with ultraviolet pump laser-driven Fredericksz threshold shifts,"Abstract Intrinsic high nonlinearity in experimentally measured laser scattering intensities poses significant difficulties in analyzing various molecular and optical properties of nematic liquid crystals (NLCs). In this respect, as we theoretically proved in a previous paper, universal nonlinear function approximator layered feedforward neural network (LFNN) can be applied to construct consistent empirical physical formulas (EPFs) for nonlinear physical phenomena. The novelty of this paper is that, by using our previous conference paper data (literature data or simply data for short) for He-Ne probe laser illumination nonlinear scattering intensities of dye-doped NLCs with ultraviolet pump laser-driven Fredericksz threshold (FT) shifts, we constructed definitive LFNN-EPFs for these illumination intensities of nonlinear scattering exhibiting FT shifts. The dyes used in the literature data were methyl red (MR) azo and disperse red (DR) anthraquinone. The LFNN-EPFs fitted the data very well. Moreover, magnificent LFNN test set forecastings over previously unseen data confirmed the consistent LFNN-EPFs inferences of the intensities of scattering. The LFNN-EPFs properly extracted the FT threshold shifts, as well as revealing the intensity dependencies on the kind of dye used. We, therefore, conclude the LFNN consistently infers nonlinear physical laws governing the NLC scattering data. Provided that sufficient scattering intensity data is available, these nonlinear physical laws embedded in LFNN-EPFs may potentially be useful for investigating various NLC molecular structure parameters in molecular nonlinear optics domain. This knowledge may be applicable in developing new optical materials.",Apr-18," Keywords Neural network Empirical physical formula Nematic liquid crystal Fredericksz transition Azo and anthraquinone dyes Scattering intensity Ultraviolent laser 1 Introduction When subjected to optical, electrical, magnetic and thermal disturbances, liquid crystal (LC) materials show highly nonlinear optical responses [1,2]. In nematic LCs, although lacking positional order, they orient in the direction of director vector n → . As LCs are fluid, their physical properties, being proportional to orientation of molecules, change depending on the alignment of LCs. The alignment of LC molecules, which are sandwiched between parallel glass plates (LC cells), can be controlled by applying an external electric field. At a critical value, applied electric field causes reorientation of LC molecules which is called the Fredericksz transition (FT). Reorientation of LC molecules induced by external electric fields are very important both for theoretical and practical purposes, for instance displays, holographic recording and tunable LC lens [3–5]. The novelty of this paper is that, by nonlinear layered feedforward neural network (LFNN) [6], we produced definitive empirical physical formulas (EPFs) for He-Ne probe laser illumination intensities of nonlinear scattering from dye-doped NLCs which exhibited ultraviolet pump laser-driven Fredericksz threshold (FT) shifts. The data for the dye-doped NLC scattering intensities (experimental data, literature data or even simply data for short) was borrowed from our previous experiments published in an international conference proceedings [7]. Because a LFNN consistently approximate any function [8], as we previously theoretically proved [9] and experimentally [10,11] showed, LFNN can be suitably used to construct EPFs. The LFNN EPFs fitted the literature experimental data [7] very well. Moreover, magnificent LFNN test set forecastings over previously unseen data showed that the scattering intensities were consistently estimated by constructed LFNN-EPFs. The LFNN-EPFs properly extracted the FT threshold shifts, as well as revealing the intensity dependencies on the kind of dye used. We, therefore, conclude the nonlinear physical laws governing the NLC scattering data can be guessed consistently by LFNN. Provided that sufficient scattering intensity data is available, these nonlinear physical laws embedded in LFNN-EPFs may potentially be useful for investigating various NLC molecular structure parameters in molecular nonlinear optics domain. This knowledge may be applicable in developing new optical materials. 2 Theories 2.1 Fredericksz transition (FT) threshold in NLCs Under external electric field, energy density of undoped nematic LC layer of thickness of d can be expressed in terms of elastic, electric and anchoring energies [12], (1) F = 1 2 K 1 ( ∇ → . n → ) 2 + 1 2 K 2 ( n → . ∇ → × n → ) 2 + 1 2 K 3 ( n → × ∇ → × n → ) 2 − 1 2 ε 0 E 2 ( Δ ε sin 2 θ + ε ⊥ ) + 1 2 W sin 2 θ 0 z = 0 z = d K 1, K 2 and K 3 being elasticity constants, n → is director vector of NLC molecules, W is the anchoring energy coefficient, Δ ε is dielectric anisotropy and magnitude of electric field is E. The director makes θ 0 angle with the boundary surface at z = 0 and z = d In dye doped LC layer, the optical torque on the molecules can be given as (2) Γ o p t i c = ε 0 ς + n e 2 − n 0 2 n → . e → n → × e → E 2 where ς is dye concentration dependent dimensionless constant, e → is electric field vector direction and no and ne are respectively refractive indices of LC for ordinary and extraordinary rays [13]. By integrating the of Eq. (2) over angle, the interaction energy between electric field of light and dye molecules is found as (3) F o p t i c = − 1 2 ε 0 ς + n e 2 − n 0 2 E 0 2 sin 2 θ where E 0 , is the electric field component of light and θ is the angle between director and electric field vector. Total energy density of dye doped LC layer is obtained as (4) F t o t a l = F e l a s t i c + F e l e c t r i c + F a n c h o r i n g + F o p t i c In planar orientation of LC molecules in the cell ( n → = ( cos θ , 0 , sin θ ) ) and with electric field perpendicular to the director, and also setting K1 = K3 [12], and θ 0 = θ , Eq. (4) takes the simpler form (5) F t o t a l = 1 2 K θ ′ 2 − ε 0 E 2 ( Δ ε sin 2 θ + ε ⊥ ) − ε 0 ς + n e 2 − n 0 2 E 0 2 sin 2 θ + W sin 2 θ z = 0 z = d where θ ′ = d θ d z . After a lengthy derivation by applying Euler-Lagrange equation to (5), with small θ and properly imposed boundary conditions at the surface, Eq. (6) is found for critical electric field (6) E C = K π 2 Δ ε ε 0 d + K W 2 − ς + n e 2 − n 0 2 E 0 2 Δ ε ε 0 Without dye molecules and optical field and with strong anchoring energy ( W → ∞ ) Eq. (6) takes the form of classical formula for FT threshold [2] as in Eq. (7) (7) E C = π d K Δ ε ε 0 2.2 Short LFNN fundamentals and EPF formation by a LFNN Under absence of satisfactory theory, unknown molecular structure parameters in LCs have to be inferred from the limited set of measured data. One method is light-scattering. Still, theoretical formulas for dye-doped NLC scattering intensities are usually unknown as well as being extremely nonlinear. Briefly, it is a difficult pursuit to obtain suitable estimations for intensities. To overcome this difficulty, because a LFNN consistently approximate any function [8], in this paper, we built up definitive LFNN-EPFs to estimate the laser light intensities of scattering from dye-doped NLCs, Methyl red (MR) and Disperse Red (DR). As anticipated, the LFNN-EPFs found excellent matches both for the actually trained literature data values and also previously unseen untrained test data values. Because we developed a novel comprehensive theory about the applicability of LFNN to EPF formation [9], we will not go into details here. Still, we briefly point out some essential points when necessary. Also, we reproduce the brief details of a LFNN here. More can be found for instance in Refs. [6,8,11]. 2.2.1 LFNN in brief Mimicking functionality of the brain, an artificial neural network (ANN) [6] is built up from artificial neurons all of which connected by changeable synapses. The new information is learnt by ANN via weight adaptation. A LFNN has one input- multi hidden-one output layer ANN (Fig. 1 ). Because a proper one hidden layer LFNN can approximate any nonlinear function [8], in this paper, we trained solely one hidden layer LFNNs. In Fig. 1 (one hidden layer) the LFNN with multi-output vector f → is used t to estimate the target output vector y → by Eq. (8) (see Ref. [8]), (8) f → : R p → R r : f → k ( x → ) = ∑ j = 1 h 1 β j G ( A j ( x → ) ) , x → ∈ R p , β j ∈ R , A j ∈ A p , and k = 1 , ... , r where A p is functions (from R p to R ) which is defined as A ( x → ) = w → • x → + b . ‘ • ’ is for scalar product operation, in Fig.1 x → being the input and w → being vector of input layer to hidden layer weights, respectively. Bias component is b . w 1 (with column vector A ( x → ) ) and w 2 (with column vector β → ) w1 and w2 are the weight matrices (see Fig. 1 and Eq. (8)). Still, from Eq. (8) and Fig. 1, the matches w 1 → A ( x → ) and w 2 → β → are true solely for LFNNs with one hidden layer. To use multiple hidden layers, both Eq. (8) and the matches need to be altered correctly. With a suitable LFNN of Eq. (8), we present the sample data to simultaneously to input and output layers. Having done a finite number cycle of weight alteration, we obtain a set of final weights with reasonable level of error value between estimated and targets outputs. If, with the final weights LFNN, the test set predictions over untrained data set are also good, then the aim has been fulfilled. That is to say, the final LFNN successfully reveals the general relationship which connects input data to output data. 2.2.2 Applicability of LFNN to EPFs Physical functions (deterministic or random) generally have several independent variables with only one dependent variable. That is, the functions have the mathematical form of g → : R p → R r , where p ≻ 1 and r = 1 ). With enough sample data, we can use Eq. (8) of LFNN to finally obtain a suitable EPF for the physical function. For more details see for instance [9,11]. In both train and test periods, the independent ( p ≻ 1 ) variables are presented to the input while the dependent one ( r = 1 ) is presented to the output layer respectively. 3 Materials and Methods: the details of LFNN application to EPFs 3.1 The literature data to produce LFNN-EPFs The scattering intensities data of dye-doped NLCs (experimental data, literature data or even simply data for short) was borrowed from our previous experiments published in an international conference proceedings [7]. In the literature data, FT threshold voltages of pure LC, dye doped LCs azo (methyl red (MR)) and anthraquinone (disperse red (DR)) had been measured by plotting the applied voltage to LC cell versus light intensity. The LC cells had been exposed to both probe He-Ne and pump UV laser light. 3.2 The LFNN structure details Commercial NeuroSolutions V5.06 neural network software was used. The LFNN was 1-1-1 layer (input-hidden-ouput). The neuron numbers were one ( p = 1 ) for input layer, variable for hidden layer p = 1 ( h 1 = 4, 7, 10) and one ( r = 1 ) for output layer. The physical variables used were as follows. Applied voltage ( for input ) and pure and dye-doped LCs intensities of laser scattering (for output). Alterable weights were in number [ p x h 1 + h 1 x r = h 1 x ( p + r ) = h 1 ( 1 + 1 ) = 2 h 1 = 2 x ( 4 − 10 ) = ( 8 − 20 ) ] in this paper [see, Fig. 1]. No bias was applied. As we usually take in our previous papers [10,11], again in this paper, in Eq. (8) we used linear functions at the output layer, and at the hidden layer were the hyperbolic tangent G activation functions, that is tanh = ( e x − e − x ) / ( e x + e − x ) . The LFNN weight adaptation method was the Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation. The whole of LFNN-EPFs were obtained by uniformly dividing the literature NLC data (consisting of 200–300 data points) into two separate parts 80% (train set to fit) and 20% (test set to predict). 3.3 The minimization of error function As in our previous papers [10,11], the error function minimization was the same apart from the identities of physical variables used. Again, the fitting error between the target and real output of the LFNN was the mean squared error (MSE) [Eq. (9)]. In Eq. (9), y → of Fig. 1 is the user defined target output vector, output vector f → of Eq. (8) is the LFNN predicted one and N is the number of train or test sample literature data. (9) M S E = ∑ k = 1 r ∑ i = 1 N y k i − f k i 2 N For both train and 10 - 3 test literature data, the final error levels were about 10 − 3 . 3.4 The definitive construction method for LFNN-EPFs of NLC laser scattering intensities Again, this part of the method is essentially the same as in our previous papers [10,11] apart from the fact that the identities of the physical variables used in this paper were naturally different from the previous ones. Therefore, we do not reproduce it here. For the definitive construction method for LFNN-EPFs, see Section 3 in Refs. [10,11]. In this paper, LFNN input vector x → was the applied voltage and target vector y → was the He-Ne probe laser scattering intensities from either pure (E7) or dye-doped (MR and DR1) NLC samples. 4 LFNN-EPFs construction results and discussion In this paper when appropriate we use the following abbreviations. exp : literature borrowed experimental data, nno : train and test set LFNN output results, au : arbitrary units. 4.1 Train set LFNN- EPFs results In Fig. 2 a–c, literature borrowed experimental data values (exp) of He-Ne probe laser light intensities which pass through the LC cells against voltage were shown together with LFNN-EPFs (nno) train set fittings of these exp values. Although already discussed in Ref. [7], still here we very briefly underline some useful points of exp values so that one can easily make comparisons with nno results. In the literature exp values by applying voltage to LC cell, FT threshold shifts had been measured with two types of measurements (with UV pump laser on/off). UV pump laser excites the LC sample and induces measurable changes by a probe He-Ne laser beam, which reaches the detector after passing through the LC cell. Detector only detects the intensity of probe laser beam. In Fig. 2a–c, literature data exp values and LFNN-EPFs (nno) train set fittings of exp values were given. With one hidden layer and h = 7 hidden neuron number, the LFNN-EPFs fitted very well the probe laser intensities for pure and dye-doped NLCs. In other words, the FT threshold shifts in NLCs were faithfully extracted by the LFNN-EPFs. Indeed, in order to gain more insight into what the LFNN-EPFs faithfully extracted, here we borrow the physical explanations from [7]. UV (exp (on)) light affects the LC-alignment layer surface energy, which causes a shift in FT threshold. As seen in Fig. 2a, UV off FT threshold voltages are higher than that of UV on voltages. Dye doped LC cells E7 + DR1, E7 + MR (Fig. 2b and c) show somewhat different behavior because under light illumination the interaction between dye molecules and LC molecules causes a change in FT threshold voltage. Marked FT threshold shifts in dye doped LC cells as compared to pure LC cell (E7) can be explained by UV light-dye and UV light-alignment surface interaction. The interactions between LC and dye molecules increases by UV light, making a significant shift in FT threshold to lower values. Note also that, from Eq. (6) we observe a decrease in FT in dye doped cells, depending on the dimensionless constant ς for dye concentration. As pointed out above, LFNN-EPFs faithfully extracted all these physical relationships (the FT threshold shifts) in NLCs. To gain an insight into how LFNN fitting ability with varying hidden neuron number is affected, in Fig. 3 a and b, with varying hidden neurons values (h = 4 to 10), nno fittings of exp values of E7 + DR1 were given for UV laser off and on conditions. As can be seen, it is very difficult to differentiate the nno fittings between h values. This may indicate that to fit our experimental results, increasing h values does not significantly contribute to better fits, indeed even LFNN with as low as h = 4 may be sufficient for acceptably well fits. 4.2 Consistent LFNN-EFPs predictions over test set If one does not investigate the performance of the train set FNN-EPFs (Figs. 2a–3b) over test sets (data not used in the train period), then one cannot consistently apply LFNNs to obtain acceptable scattering intensity EPFs. That is, if the train set LFNNs forecast well the test set data, one can consider the LFNN to have learnt the literature data in a consistent manner. We regard the consistent LFNNs as acceptable LFNN-EPFs. In Fig. 4 a-c, respectively for pure (E7) and dye-doped NLCs (DR1, MR), the estimations of the test set which correspond to train set results of Fig. 2a–c were plotted. In Fig. 4a-c, test set nno estimations of exp values were very good. Also, in Fig. 5 a-b, the test set estimations which correspond to train set results of Fig. 3a-b were remarkably good. These agreements show that the LFNNs consistently find the physical knowledge embedded in scattering intensities of FT threshold shifts in NLCs. In short, the constructed LFNNs can be used with safety as convenient LFNN-EPFs for scattering intensities accompanied with FT threshold shifts in NLCs. 5 Conclusion In this paper, for pure and dye-doped NLCs with ultraviolet pump laser-driven Fredericksz threshold shifts, we produced definitive LFNN-EPFs by using literature data of nonlinear scattering intensities. Marked conclusions and potential applications can be presented in the following. 1 Exceptional LFNN test set estimations over previously unseen data show that LFNN-EPFs predict the intensities consistently. Accordingly, the physical laws pertaining the FT shifts can be consistently revealed by the constructed LFNN. 2 The LFNN-EPFs estimate correctly the dependence of intensities on the identity of dye. 3 By using consistent NLC intensity predictions, the LFNN-EPFs may contribute to determine the undiscovered structure parameters of LC molecules.

Solitons which arise due to the balance of the dispersive and nonlinear terms are a class of stable waves [1–4,17–19]. Under the continuous wave background the breather solution is often established. Breathers can be seen as the localized oscillating solitons in which the energy distribution is localized and periodic. According to the propagation characteristics, they are divided into the Kuznetsov–Ma breather (periodic in time but localized in space) and the Akhmediev breather (periodic in space but localized in time) [5,6]. There exists another kind of the localized solution, the Peregrine soliton (PS), which can well describe the rogue waves (RWs) [7,16]. As the limiting case of the breather solution, it is localized both in spatial and time. Recent studies have shown that the higher-order terms can lead to the conversion of nonlinear localized and periodic waves on the continuous wave background [20–23]. The dynamic breather-to-soliton and RWs-to-soliton conversions have been established in some nonlinear systems [24–26]. In this paper, we focus on a generalized higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation in the operator form (1.1) i ψ x + S [ ψ ( x , t ) ] − i α H [ ψ ( x , t ) ] + γ P [ ψ ( x , t ) ] = 0 , where S [ ψ ( x , t ) ] = 1 2 ψ tt + ψ | ψ | 2 , H [ ψ ( x , t ) ] = ψ ttt + 6 ψ t | ψ | 2 , P [ ψ ( x , t ) ] = ψ tttt + 6 ψ | ψ | 4 + 4 ψ | ψ t * | 2 + 8 ψ tt | ψ | 2 + 6 ψ t 2 ψ * + 2 ψ 2 ψ tt * . S, H and P denote the nonlinear Schrödinger operator, the Hirota operator, and the Lakshmanan–Porsezian–Daniel (LPD) operator respectively. Eq. (1.1) has two independent coefficients: α and γ, in which the third-order and fourth-order linear dispersion and other nonlinear terms such as Kerr effects, cubic quintic nonlinearity, self-steepening and self-frequency shift are taken into consideration. When γ =0, without considering the LPD operator, Eq. (1.1) becomes the Hirota equation [22]. If α =0, Eq. (1.1) is known as the LPD equation modeling a general class of the one-dimensional continuum Heisenberg spin chain [23]. The integrability, Lax pair, and lower-orders soliton solutions of Eq. (1.1) have been demonstrated [27] and the existence of N-soliton by the bilinear method has been investigated in [28]. Furthermore, the Kuznetsov–Ma breather and Akhmediev breather on the continuous wave background has presented [29]. In this paper, we display a breather solution expression with two free parameters on the plane-wave background and derive some new types of nonlinear localized and periodic solutions, such as multi-peak soliton, antidark soliton, W-shaped soliton and periodic wave. Finally, we provide some examples of breathers into solitons and analyze the interaction behaviors of these nonlinear waves. 2 Different types of nonlinear waves For Eq. (1.1), we can use the Darboux transformation (DT) technique to generate the breather solution on the plane wave background. Substituting the seed solution ψ [0] = k exp[i(Gx + Ft)] by the Lax pair given in [27], we obtain the first order linear functions r 1 and s 1 in the form (2.1a) r 1 = 2 ie − ( i / 2 ) ( 1 + 6 γ ) x sin [ B ] , (2.1b) s 1 = 2 e ( i / 2 ) ( 1 + 6 γ ) x cos [ C ] . From the onefold DT, the first-order breather solution is (2.2) ψ [ 1 ] = 1 + 2 b N r + iN i D 1 e ix ( 1 + 6 γ ) , where κ = κ r + i κ i = 1 + λ 2 = 1 + ( a + ib ) 2 , A = A r + iA i , χ = χ r + i χ i = arccos [ κ ] , B = A − χ / 2 , C = A + χ / 2 , N r = cosh [ 2 A i ] sin [ χ r ] − sin [ 2 A r ] cosh [ χ i ] , N i = sinh [ 2 A i ] cos [ χ r ] − cos [ 2 A r ] sinh [ χ i ] , D = cosh [ 2 A i ] cosh [ χ i ] − sin [ 2 A r ] sin [ χ r ] . λ is a spectral parameter, and A r = t κ r + zV r , A i = t κ i + zV i , V r = d r κ r − d i κ i , V i = d r κ r + d i κ i , d r = a + α η 1 + γ η 2 , d i = b − α η 3 + γ η 4 , with η 1 =2(1−2a 2 +2b 2), η 2 =2a(η 1 +8b 2), η 3 =8ab and η 4 =2b(η 1 −8a 2). To simplify we fix the values of the amplitude k and the frequency F of the background in the above expression. Solution (2.2) depends on four independent parameters: the coefficients of the higher-orders effects α, γ, and the real parameters a, b. By adjusting their values to meet certain relations, we can present the breather-to-soliton conversions and derive different types of wave structures in solution (2.2). Since both N and D are composed of the trigonometric function and the hyperbolic function. Solution (2.2) characterizes an unified structure combined a soliton and a periodic wave with the propagation velocities V r /κ r and V i /κ i respectively. Based on the velocity difference, some new types of nonlinear wave structures can be clearly demonstrated in the following two cases: Case 1 – V r /κ r ≠ V i /κ i . Solution (2.2) shows an one-breather structure on the plane-wave background. Further taking a =− F/2, we have the time-periodic Kuznetsov–Ma breather with |k|<|b| and the space-periodic Akhmediev breather with |k|>|b|. When |k|→|b|, the period tends to infinity. Solution (2.2) describes the Peregrine soliton(PS) which is localized both in time and space. Case 2 – V r /κ r = V i /κ i . In this case, d j =0. The breather can be converted to other nonlinear waves in solution (2.2). The exact conversion relation can be obtained (2.3) 4 ( 1 − 6 a 2 + 2 b 2 ) γ = 8 a α − 1 . The higher-order coefficients α and γ cannot be zero simultaneously in this conversion. Based on parametric analysis, several types of localized and periodic structures are displayed in Figs. 1–7. If a ≠− F/2, then κ r ≠0, κ i ≠0. Solution (2.2) presents the multi-peak soliton, which is a localized one-soliton with some oscillation or main peaks [23,30]. This structure can describe the propagation of the few cycle pulses (FCP) in the Kerr media [31]. Figs. 1 and 2 depict the one-cycle pulses soliton and the two-cycle pulses soliton respectively. As shown in Figs. 1–3, when the parameter a increases, the oscillation becomes stronger. If a =− F/2, there are three solution structures displayed in Figs. 3–5 . When |k|<|b|, we have κ r =0, κ i ≠0, then V r =0, V i = κ i d r . Solution (2.2) keeps the soliton feature and a antidark soliton [32] is depicted in Fig. 4. When |k|>|b|, then V i =0, V i = κ r d r . Solution (2.2) shows the periodic structure. In Figs. 5 and 6 , we obtain two kinds of periodic waves with the period D t = π k 2 − b 2 . When |k|→|b|, D t →∞. Solution (2.2) generates a W-shaped solution [33] depicted in Fig. 7 . It is a limiting case of Fig. 6. 3 Conversion and interaction between the nonlinear waves In this section, we demonstrate the second-order breather-to-soliton conversion and mutual interaction of the different localized and periodic waves in Eq. (1.1). To give the second-order breather solution, we use (2.1) to have two sets of first order linear functions r 1,1 = r 1(λ 1), s 1,1 = s 1(λ 1) and r 1,2 = r 1(λ 2), s 1,2 = s 1(λ 2) with the eigenvalues λ 1 and λ 2 respectively, where r 1,j and s 1,j (j =1, 2) keep the same form as r 1 and s 1 in Section 1: λ j = a j + ib j , r 1 , j = 2 ie − ( i / 2 ) ( 1 + 6 γ ) x sin [ B j ] , s 1 , j = 2 e ( i / 2 ) ( 1 + 6 γ ) x cos [ C j ] , κ j = κ jr + i κ ji = 1 + λ j 2 = 1 + ( a j + ib j ) 2 , A j = A jr + iA ji , χ j = χ jr + i χ ji = arccos [ κ 1 ] , B j = A j − χ j / 2 , C j = A j + χ j / 2 , A jr = t κ jr + zV jr , A ji = t κ ji + zV ji , V jr = ( a j + α η j 1 + γ η j 2 ) κ jr − ( b j − α η j 3 + γ η j 4 ) κ ji , V ji = ( a j + α η j 1 + γ η j 2 ) κ jr + ( b j − α η j 3 + γ η j 4 ) κ ji . By DT technique [27], the second-order linear functions r 2,1 and s 2,1 can be written as (3.1a) r 2 , 1 = 2 ( − 4 ib 1 cosh [ iC 1 * ] cosh [ iC 2 ] sinh [ iB 1 ] − sinh [ iB 2 ] ( k 1 D 11 + k 2 D 12 ) ) D 11 + D 12 , (3.1b) s 2 , 1 = 2 ( 4 ib 1 cosh [ iC 1 ] sinh [ iB 1 * ] sinh [ iB 2 ] − cosh [ iC 2 ] ( − k 2 D 11 + k 1 D 12 ) ) D 11 + D 12 , where k 1 = a 1 − a 2 + i ( b 1 − b 2 ) , k 2 = a 1 − a 2 − i ( b 1 − ib 2 ) , D 11 = − cos [ 2 B r 1 ] + cosh [ 2 B i 1 ] , D 12 = cos [ 2 C r 1 ] + cosh [ 2 C i 1 ] . Further, the following second-order breather solution ψ [2] can be obtained (3.2) ψ [ 2 ] = ψ [ 1 ] − 2 i ( λ 2 − λ 2 * ) s 2 , 1 r 2 , 1 * r 2 , 1 2 + s 2 , 1 2 . Solution (3.2) describes the second-order breather structure on the plane-wave background, which contains two groups of the velocities: V 1r /κ 1r ,V 1i /κ 1i and V 2r /κ 2r ,V 2i /κ 2i . The velocities in each group correspond to each breather component and are determined by each eigenvalues in solution (3.2). Similarly, by the analysis of the velocities, the transition, coexistence, and interaction of different types of localized and periodic waves are exhibited for Eq.(1.1). Case 1 – V jr /κ jr = V ji /κ ji , j =1, 2. The second-order breather is converted into the soliton solution. We have (3.3) 4 ( 1 − 6 a j 2 + 2 b j 2 ) γ = 8 a j α − 1 , j = 1 , 2 . By adjusting parameters to meet the above relations, two breather components in solution (3.2) are all converted into other nonlinear waves. The coexistence and interaction of these localized and periodic structures are displayed in Fig. 8 . Case 2 – V 1r /κ 1r = V 1i /κ 1i , V 2r /κ 2r ≠ V 2i /κ 2i . We can choose one of the two breather components to convert it to a soliton, and the other component's structure remain unchanged. It is clear that the conclusion of the parameters condition met by these soliton and periodic solutions still holds. Then we can display many examples on the mutual interactions between breather and other types of nonlinear waves in Fig. 9 . Case 3 – V 1i /κ 1i = V 2i /κ 2i . This condition leads to the parallel propagation of the two breather component in solution (3.2). Taking λ 2 =1+0.2i and b 1 =0.8, we get a 1 =0.730,−0.0558, and 1.1584. A simple example is displayed in Fig. 10 (a) with a 1 =0.730. As shown in Fig. 10, two single component breather with different amplitudes and velocities keep the same propagation direction. 4 Conclusions In this paper, we have investigated a generalized higher-order dispersive nonlinear Schrödinger equation with two independent parameters. The breather solution has been converted into several types of solutions including multi-peak soliton, antidark soliton, W-shaped structure and periodic waves under different parameter conditions. Via some graphic illustrations, the coexistences and interactions of these nonlinear waves have been analyzed.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.041,Interferometric array configuration design for the expected UV-plane coverage,"Abstract UV-plane coverage (UVPC) represents the distribution of spatial frequency sampling of the interferometric array. This paper focuses on designing an interferometric array configuration for the expected UVPC. The method presented uses the array that can entirely sample the expected UVPC points as the initial array, and gradually deletes apertures to obtain a final array. The advantage of the method is that it can design an array configuration for any expected UVPC and the distribution of the generated UVPC can be quite similar to the expected one. Two examples are given to present the feasibility of the method.",Apr-18," Keywords Interferometric array Array configuration design UV-plane coverage Removing apertures 1 Introduction In the past decades, optical telescopes have been built with increasingly large aperture for higher resolution observation in astronomy. With the aperture size growing, cost and weight grow too, which limits the construction of a large telescope. Several ways have been developed to solve this problem. One of them is the interferometric array, which can sample the spatial frequency information of the target and then obtain the intensity distribution by inverse Fourier transform. The resolution of an interferometric array depending on the longest baseline can reach up to hundreds of meters. UVPC comes from the locations of the array apertures and represents the distribution of spatial frequency sampling of the interferometric array. Excellent UVPC helps find important frequency information of the observed target and restore high quality target image. Therefore it is necessary to arrange the array configuration for the expected UVPC. There has been enormous research about the interferometric array configuration. For example, Golay [1] and Kopilovich [2] have discussed the construction of nonredundant array configurations; Boone [3] and Villiers [4] provided methods to achieve a desired natural tapering for the density distribution of the UVPC. Y. Su [5] introduced a “sieving” algorithm, removing element candidates in an array to fit the UVPC to a predefined shape. However, those approaches can only obtain uniform or Gaussian UVPC distributed symmetrically along the radius. In some practical cases, we need the UVPC to provide high resolution in several directions, where the densities of the UV-plane points are larger while uniform or Gaussian UVPC cannot meet the demand. Olivier Guyon [6] has proposed an optimization of UVPC for a rotating phased array of telescopes, telling us that when making use of the Earth's rotation for ground-based interferometers, nonuniform snapshot UVPC is needed. This paper will present a method that can design an array configuration for any expected UVPC. The method uses the array that can entirely sample the expected UVPC points as the initial array, and gradually deletes apertures to obtain a final array. This method is introduced in detail in Section 2. Two examples are given to present the feasibility of the method in Section 3. 2 Array configuration design method An array’s UVPC can be calculated accurately by the locations of its apertures, while the locations of array’s apertures cannot be calculated by UVPC. The relation between the UV-plane point and the location of apertures can be written as (1) ( u , v ) = ( x 2 − x 1 , y 2 − y 1 ) λ Where u and v are the coordinates of the UV-plane point, x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , y 2 are the coordinates of the apertures, λ is the wavelength. However, if put apertures on every point of half of the UVPC, these apertures plus the aperture on the center of the plane can form an array whose UVPC entirely contains all the points of the former UVPC. This case is shown in Fig. 1 . Of course, the number of the apertures is too large and the array will produce vast extra UV-plane points. Naturally, if we can reduce the number of the apertures while keeping the UV-plane points we want, the array configuration will be closer to an expected one. The question is how we could reduce the number of the apertures. In the array mentioned above, we actually only use the connections between the center aperture and “non-center” apertures to get the expected UV-plane points, and the connections between “non-center” apertures produce the extra UV-plane points. Considering a simple case shown in Fig. 2 , if the connection between one aperture A and the center aperture O is equal to the connection between some other two apertures B and C, which means the length and orientation of two connections are the same, then the aperture A is useless to produce the expected UV-plane points and it is necessary to delete it. Therefore, the number of apertures can be reduced by taking advantage of the connection between “non-center” apertures. However, the practical case is usually more complicated. Firstly, two entirely equal connections might not be existed. But if the length and orientation of two connections are close enough, we can treat them as the equal connection. Secondly, as shown in Fig. 3 , if one aperture’s connection with the center aperture can be replaced, but its connections with other “non-center” apertures replace more apertures’ connections with the center aperture, the operation of deleting this aperture will make more apertures that can be deleted survive. This situation leads to a question that which aperture should be really deleted. Here, we use two parameters to describe the contribution and substitutability of every aperture. Suppose A is the set of entire apertures, a 0 , a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N represent the apertures, where a 0 represent the center aperture. We have (2) A = a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , ⋯ , a N Define a x a y as the connection between a x and a y , a x a y = a m a n represents that two connections are the same (both length and orientation). The contribution C k of a k can be defined as the number of the set a m , a n , which satisfies (3) a k a m = a 0 a n ( 1 ≤ k , m , n ≤ N , k ≠ m , n ) The substitutability S k of a k can be defined as the number of the set a p , a q , which satisfies (4) a 0 a k = a p a q ( 1 ≤ k , p , q ≤ N , k ≠ p , q ) If an aperture has high contribution and low substitutability, it contributes to the expected UVPC a lot, and few other aperture pairs can replace it, which means it is supposed to be kept. If an aperture has low contribution and high substitutability, its impact on the expected UVPC is insignificant and can be replaced by other aperture pairs, which means it can be removed. To decide which aperture should be removed first, we define an objective function for each aperture. The objective function for each aperture can be defined as f k = S k / C k , ( 1 ≤ k ≤ N ). If C k = 0 , f k is treated as infinity. The aperture with maximum f k will be deleted first. Then calculate f k for every aperture again. Repeat the operation until the number of apertures or the UVPC meets the demand. The remaining apertures constitute the final array configuration. The parameters of every aperture except the center aperture in Fig. 3 are shown in Table 1 . Obviously, aperture E and G have maximum objective functions and should be deleted first. This result agrees with the demand for fewest aperture number. It is not appropriate to define the objective function as f k = S k − C k ,( 1 ≤ k ≤ N ). For example, aperture a 1 : C 1 = 0 , S 1 = 6 , f 1 = S 1 − C 1 = 6 ; aperture a 2 : C 2 = 5 , S 2 = 12 , f 2 = S 2 − C 2 = 7 . So that aperture a 2 should be deleted first. But aperture a 1 has no contribution to delete other apertures while 6 pairs of other apertures can replace it, so there is no reason to keep a 1 . When the objective function is f k = S k / C k , f 1 = inf , f 2 = 2.4 , aperture a 1 will be deleted first and aperture a 2 will be kept temporarily, which is more reasonable. The procedure of the presented array configuration construction can be concluded as follows: Step 1: Construct an initial array configuration according to the expected UVPC. The initial array contains apertures on points of half of the UVPC and a center aperture. Step 2: Set a maximum acceptable aperture number of the final array. Step 3: Calculate the objective function for every aperture and delete the aperture with maximum objective function. Step 4: Repeat the operation in step 3 until the aperture number equals the one set in step 2. The rest of the apertures constitute the final array. The impact of different aperture numbers on the final UVPC will be discussed in Section 3. 3 Examples We give two examples showing the results of array construction. The expected UVPC in Fig. 4 is distributed symmetrically along the radius, which is common in the traditional array configuration optimization research. The expected UVPC in Fig. 5 is distributed asymmetrically along the radius with the UV-plane points inside two circular areas. As mentioned in Section 2, if the length and orientation of the aperture connections are close enough, we treat them as the equal connection. However, too small tolerable errors of the length and orientation might lead to zero contribution and zero substitutability for most apertures, making the deleting operation quite random, while too large tolerable errors will make final result inaccurate. In practical cases, the tolerable errors should be determined by the accuracy requirement. Here, the tolerable error of length of the aperture connection is set as 0.5 m and the tolerable error of orientation of the aperture connection is set as 0.02 rad for good results. The picture (d) of Figs. 4 and 5 show the final array configuration with a certain number of apertures respectively. Their UVPC in the picture (e) of Figs. 4 and 5 are quite similar with the expected UVPC in the picture (a) respectively. To evaluate the result, we give the distribution of the expected UV-plane points that are missed (in the picture (f) of Figs. 4 and 5) and the distribution of extra UV-plane points (in the picture (g) of Figs. 4 and 5). And we give the parameters of results with different final aperture number, shown in Tables 2 and 3 . The number of the expected UV-plane point in Fig. 4(a) is 210, so that the number of initial array apertures is 106 (210/2 + 1=106). The theoretical least number of apertures to form this UVPC is 15 (15 × 14 = 210), although the array configuration with 15 apertures that forms this expected UVPC might not exist. Fig. 4 shows the final array configuration with 30 apertures and its UVPC. Although extra UV-plane points exist, the shape of the UVPC in Fig. 4(e) is similar to the expected one in Fig. 4(a). From the Table 2, we can find that when the aperture number is 30, the proportion of missing expected UV-plane points is only 2.9%, which means almost all the expected UV-plane points are obtained. The number of the expected UV-plane point in Fig. 5(a) is 420, so that the number of the initial array apertures is 211 (420/2 + 1=211). The theoretical least number of apertures to form this UVPC is 21 (21 × 20 = 420). From Table 3, we can find that when the aperture number is 50, the proportion of missing expected UV-plane points is 2.9%, which means most of the expected UV-plane points are obtained. But Fig. 5 shows that the UVPC produced by 30 apertures is already similar to the expected UVPC. According to the Tables 2 and 3, with the final aperture number increasing linearly, the number of expected UV-plane points missed does not decrease linearly while the number of extra UV-plane points increases fast. In practical cases, whether to obtain the entire expected UVPC points should be considered carefully, because sometimes missing a few UV-plane points will not influence the general distribution of expected UVPC but decrease the aperture number largely. The method proposed by Y. Su is a little similar to our method. We both remove apertures from candidate apertures. But there are two major differences between our methods. First, the candidate apertures in Y. Su’s method come from the practical terrain or random distribution, while the candidate apertures in our method come from the expected UVPC. Second, Y. Su’s method aims to form uniform or Gaussian tapered UVPC, while our method aims to form any expected UVPC. 4 Conclusion A method that can design an array configuration for the expected UVPC is provided in this paper. This method uses the array that can entirely sample the expected UVPC points as the initial array, and gradually deletes apertures to obtain a final array. The contribution, substitutability and an objective function for every aperture are defined as the indications to delete apertures. The advantage of this method is that it can design an array configuration for any expected UVPC and the distribution of the generated UVPC can be quite similar to the expected one. Two examples were given to present the feasibility of the method. It can be applied in the field of interferometer imaging. "," [1] M.J.E.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.001,A novel unsupervised bands selection algorithm for hyperspectral image,Abstract A novel bands selection method based on ABS (Adaptive Band Selection) and JSKF (Joint Skewness-Kurtosis Figure) is proposed in this paper. The hyperspectral data is separated into different sub-spaces by employing ABS and JSKF respectively. Subsequently a novel optimal bands selection method NIA (Normalization Index Algorithm) is proposed to select the optimal bands according to the value of ABS and JSKF. Both the high correlations of the adjacent bands and the richness of complementary information are considered in detail in this proposed method. Some numerical simulations are made to test the validity and capability of the proposed dimension reduction algorithm.,Apr-18," Keywords Hyperspectral Dimension reduction Bands selection ABS JSKF 1 Introduction With the advanced development of the spectrometers, we are entering a new age of hyperspectral remote sensing. The high spectral resolution airborne and satellite spectrometers improve the capability for capture of targets in fields as diverse as geology, environment monitoring, agriculture or military [1]. However, the high dimensionality not only increases computational complexity but also may degrade classification accuracy [2]. Accordingly, dimensionality reduction is a necessary preprocessing step to obtain a smaller set of features that summarize the information in the hyperspectral image cube for most of the applications [3]. Some dimension reduction algorithms based on different transformations have been proposed to improve classifier efficiency on the hyperspectral image due to the high-dimensional nature of the data recently [4–7]. Moreover, some kinds of dimension reduction methods based on bands selection which can remove the bands that convey little or no discriminatory information have also been deeply researched [8–12]. There are primarily two kinds of approaches to reduce data dimensions can be identified in recent researches. The first approach is based on domain transform, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), OSP (Orthogonal Subspace Projection), CA (Canonical Analysis) and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform). Since the data are transformed, some critical information may be compromised and distorted [8].The other one is based on non-transform, like optimal bands selection and original data partition. In our research, the second approach is considered and utilized to reduce the dimensions of the hyperspectral image because the verified capability in keeping the characteristics of the original data [13]. It is anticipated that the redundancy resulting from inter-band correlation should be high and can be removed without loss the important information [7]. Therefore, the correlations of the adjacent bands in hyperspectral image should considered in detail. On the other word, the high correlations of the adjacent bands should be reduced and the selected bands should reserve the band range as wide as possible. However, the experimental result demonstrates that the optimal bands selected by ABS method will focus in a narrow spectral band. Furthermore, the JSKF classification can be used to divide the hyperspectral image into several subspaces. This subspaces ideas can be considered in bands selection algorithm to obtain a wide range selection result. Based on the selection algorithm ABS and JSKF, a novel bands selection method NIA is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the ABS and JSKF algorithms are introduced briefly and the band selection results are considered the intermediate variables of the proposed algorithm. A hyperspectral image is divided into diverse sub-spaces according to the threshold value of ABS and JSKF, respectively. The high level of redundancy from adjacent bands correlation can be reduce effectively after sifting by the ABS model. Meanwhile, the value of JSKF represents the degree of deviating from the normal distribution which equal to the degree of richness of complementary information [14]. Subsequently a new bands selection algorithm NIA is introduced to combine and take advantages of the two partitions sub-spaces from ABS and JSKF. Besides, the statistics evaluations of the selected bands are also considered in the paper. Numerical simulation is performed to validate the performance of the proposed bands selection algorithm for hyperspectral image. The rest of the paper is organized in the following sequence. In Section 2, the proposed bands selection algorithm is introduced in detail. In Section 3, numerical simulation results are made and given to demonstrate the validity of the algorithm. Concluding remarks are summarized in conclusion. 2 Bands selection algorithm Firstly, both the ABS and JSKF band partition algorithm are introduced in this section. Thereafter, the intact bands selection algorithm based on the ABS and JSKF is addressed in detail. 2.1 The authentic hyperspectral data The original data in this paper are acquired by a hyperspectral camera. The hyperspectral camera used in this research is Image-λ-V10E-PS, as shown in Fig. 1 , and its basic parameters are listed in Table 1 . In this experiment, the capture angle of the camera is controlled by the electric turntable as shown in Fig. 1, and the hyperspectral camera can be fixed on the turntable. In addition, to reduce the influence of ambient lighting changes, we chose a sunny afternoon in this experiment. The digital images are multiplexed and transmitted to computer in real-time. Here infrared cut filter or polarizer is not used in the present experiment. Some pre-processing, like grayscale correction and denoising, are necessary because of the systematic errors exist in this acquisition operations. One of the experiment data having 303 bands and 256 × 256 pixels for each band is regarded as the original data in this research. The false color composite of this hyperspectral image and its 3D sensitive schematic are shown in Fig. 2 . The black spot in the image is a tank model we set before. In the following sections, all the hyperspectral data are on behalf of this cube data by default. 2.2 OIF and ABS algorithm The concept of OIF (Optimal Index Factor) was first proposed by Chavez Berlin and Sowers in 1982 [15]. In their paper, OIF provides a new method to select an optimal group of the bands by estimating the value of OIF. High value of OIF indicates that the bands contain much information with little duplication [16]. In other words, the selected bands obtain more information and can reflect the different spectral features of the objects in the image more roundly. The OIF can be expressed as (1) O I F = ∑ i = 1 n σ i ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = i + 1 n R i , j where σ i represents the standard deviation of the i - t h band of the hyperspectral image. The parameter R i , j denotes the correlation coefficients between the i - t h band and j - t h band of the image. In the literature [15], three bands are combined as a cluster and the total value of their OIF will be regarded as the only index of the subset. However, the drawbacks of this algorithm were soon appears in the practical application [17]. The “optimal” cluster of the hyperspectral image may not perform as wonderful as the description in the literature [15]. The fatal drawback of OIF is that the author neglected the high correlation between the adjacent bands. The correlation coefficients of each two bands are varying for different positions, the 3D schematic and the correlation coefficients curve of the adjacent bands are shown in Fig. 3 . Where the CCAB in Fig. 1(b) is short for Correlation-Coefficients-of-Adjacent-Bands and the hyperspectral data used in Fig. 3 contain 303 bands. The correlation coefficients of the adjacent bands used in this paper is defined as (2) C C A B = R i , i + 1 i = 1 , 2 ⋯ n - 1 , Following the OIF, some improved algorithms based on OIF are proposed to mitigate the influence of CCAB [13]. A new algorithm called ABS was proposed recently which the correlation of the adjacent bands is considered and utilized. The ABS index can be expressed as follow (3) I n d e x ( i ) = σ i ( R i − 1 , i + R i , i + 1 ) / 2 (4) σ i = 1 M × N ∑ x = 1 M ∑ y = 1 N f i x , y − μ i 2 1 2 (5) R i , j = E ( f i − μ i ) ( f j − μ j ) E ( f i − μ i ) 2 E ( f j − μ j ) 2 where I n d e x ( i ) denotes the ABS index value of the i - t h band. The parameters σ i and R i , j represent the standard deviation of the i - t h band and the correlation coefficients between the i - t h band and j - t h band of the image respectively. M a n d N gives the size of the specify band of the hyperspectral image. Besides, f i and μ i represent the i - t h band image and the average pixel value of the i - t h band image respectively. The symbol E is on behalf of mathematic expectation. The ABS curve of the experimental hyperspectral data is represented in Fig. 4 . It is obviously that all the maximum values of the ABS are concentrated in the exclusive “peak” of the curve as shown in Fig. 4. The result has demonstrated that the optimal bands selected by ABS method will focus in a narrow spectral band which disobeyed the original expectation of this algorithm. One of the main advantages of hyperspectral image is that it can provide the completed spectral information which is useful for analyzing the composition of the material. Thus, some improving schemes should be designed for ABS. 2.3 Joint-Skewness-Kurtosis-Figure algorithm The statistics parameters skewness and kurtosis are usually employed in multiple conflicting and competing portfolio objectives [18,19]. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution while kurtosis is a measure of the extent to which observations cluster around a central point. Both the skewness and kurtosis are sensitive to isolated peaks and valleys [20]. For a standard normal distribution, the value of skewness and kurtosis statistic are equal to zero. For hyperspectral image, the background information is approximate Gaussian distributed and the target features can be regarded as the anomaly information [14,21]. Therefore, to select the bands which target features are more clearly can be simplify as to select the bands which are obviously deviated from Gaussian distribution. Here the Joint-Skewness-Kurtosis-Figure (JSKF) is introduced to test the bands deviation from the Gaussian distribution. The definition of skewness, kurtosis and JSKF can be expressed as follow (6) S k e w n e s s = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n f i − μ 3 1 n ∑ i = 1 n f i − μ 2 3 2 (7) K u r t o s i s = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( f i − μ ) 4 1 n ∑ i = 1 n f i − μ 2 2 − 3 (8) J S K F = S k e w n e s s ⋅ K u r t o s i s where f i and μ represent the i - t h band image and the average pixel value of the hyperspectral image respectively. The symbol n is the largest band number of the hyperspectral data. In fact, Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) are the definition of the third central moment and fourth central moment of the data. The JSKF curve of the experimental hyperspectral data is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The result of the JSKF can be divided into three sub-spaces adaptively according to the distribution of the value. The grayscale distribution and anomaly information are similar in the same sub-space while the similarity between different sub-spaces is much lower [14]. For this reason, the classification based on the value JSKF is suitable for bands selection of the hyperspectral image. 2.4 Novel bands selection algorithm The flowchart of the bands selection scheme is displayed in Fig. 6 . To design this bands selection algorithm both the ABS and JSKF method are considered and utilized. Firstly, the hyperspectral data is divided into single band as shown in Fig. 6. Subsequently, the hyperspectral data is converted by suing JSKF algorithm and the data is divided into certain sub-spaces by estimating the JSKF value. In the meantime, the hyperspectral data is also converted by ABS algorithm and the result of ABS is classified into certain sub-spaces by the rule of JSKF algorithm. In the following step, a bands selection method called NIA (Normalization Index Algorithm) is proposed in order to perform the full algorithm shown in Fig. 6. Finally, the NIA is performed for the results of the ABS and JSKF and the selected bands in NIA are regarded as the final selection of this novel algorithm. Two weight factors p and q representing background information and anomaly targets information are introduced in NIA. Some simulations will be given to show the capability of this algorithm in Section 3. In order to perform the full algorithm, NIA is necessary to be introduced in this section. The Normalization Index Algorithm is performed as follow: the hyperspectral data in each subset are encoded afresh respectively. Assume that the three partitions of the data are encoded as (9) a 1 , a 2 ... , a l ; j 1 , j 2 ... , j l , 1 s t s u b s e t a l + 1 , a l + 2 ... , a m ; j l , j l + 1 ... , j m , 2 n d s u b s e t a m + 1 , a l + 2 ... , a n ; j m + 1 , j m + 1 ... , j n . 3 r d s u b s e t where a and j represent the value of ABS and JSKF respectively. n is the total number of the hyperspectral data where n = 303 in this research. Moreover, the quantities of each subsets in this experiment are l , m - l and n - m as we can obtain in Eq. (9). Subsequently the values of NIA can be obtained according to the classification in Eq. (9). The normalized NIA results are regarded as the final valuation factors in this research. Besides, the parameter k in Eq. (10) is correlated to the parameter i mentioned before. The k - t h band will be considered to select while the value of NIA is more close to 1 than others. Moreover the quantity of the selected bands can be controlled by a threshold value. The k - t h value of NIA is defined as (10) N I A ( k ) = p a k | max ( a 1 , a 2 ... , a l ) | + q j k | max ( j 1 , j 2 ... , j l ) | , ( 0 ≤ k ≤ l ) p a k | max ( a l , a l + 1 ... , a m ) | + q j k | max ( j l + 1 , j l + 2 ... , j m ) | , ( l < k ≤ m ) p a k | max ( a m + 1 , a m + 2 ... , a n ) | + q j k | max ( j m + 1 , j m + 2 ... , j n ) | . ( m < k ≤ n ) (11) p + q = 1 where the parameters p and q denote two weight factors of NIA. Note that p and q are equal to 0.5 respectively in this paper. Actually, other values can be introduced for replacing the value we set. It depends on what kinds of information we search for. The parameter p represents the weight of information and independence of the bands while q represents the weight of anomaly targets information. 3 Numerical simulation Numerical simulation in this section is considered for demonstrating of the bands selection algorithm. A hyperspectral image obtained from the experiment mentioned above who having 256 × 256 pixels is regarded as the original images and is shown in Fig. 2. Of the data, there are several classes: tree, grass, road, trail, tank models and shadow. Furthermore, some objective performance evaluation criteria are used to assess the proposed algorithm in this paper, such as the standard deviation, average gradient and Entropy. The hyperspectral image obtained from the experiment owns 520 bands from 400 nm to 1000 nm is merit-based selected. To simplify the calculation, the original data is equidistant sampled into 303 bands in the visible wave range. As the partition shown in Fig. 6, the hyperspectral data is divided into three sub-spaces: { 1 , 2... , 125 } , { 125 , 126... , 213 } and { 214 , 215... , 303 } . In other words, the parameter l and m in Eq. (9) are confirmed as 125 and 213 respectively. Part of the bands selection results and the stem curve of NIA are displayed in Figs. 7 and 8 respectively. It is obviously that the curve of NIA is smoother than those ABS and JSKF, especially when the weight factor q is larger than p . Of course the selecting operation will be taken place among all the subsets as shown in Fig. 8. The smooth values and decentralized selected bands are benefit to bands selection since we can reserve the visible wave range spectral information approximately which is significant to the following processing for the hyperspectral data (e.g. anomaly target detection and recognition). Besides, some statistics evaluations like standard deviation, space frequency, entropy and average gradient are applied to evaluate the selected bands. The statistics evaluation in detail is shown in Table 2 . Note that the “Average” in the last list of Table 2 is the average value of the entire bands. Larger standard deviation and entropy indicate that more information is contained in the selected bands while the larger average gradient indicates richer detailed information. As shown in Table 2, the selected bands perform better than the average one in all of the statistics evaluations. To demonstrate the validity and capability of the proposed algorithm, the ABS and JSKF are considered to the following comparison experiment. The experiment results of ABS, JSKF and proposed algorithm are listed in Table 3 . It is obviously that the selected bands of ABS and JSKF algorithm are centralized in the relatively narrow area which matches the curves in Figs. 4 and 5. Also, the corresponding spectral positions of the selected bands by different algorithms are illustrated in Fig. 9 . From the curves shown in Fig. 9, the curve of ABS algorithm is close to a horizon line which the positions are centralized in the narrow range [134, 149]. In addition, the performance of JSKF algorithm is better than the ABS one, however, the range of the selected bands is still much worse than the proposed algorithm. The selected bands of the algorithm we proposed covers most of the spectrum which benefit to the anomaly target detection and recognition as mentioned before. Mutual information is a typical measure for independence between random variables. In the following experiment, the mutual information is considered and utilized to test the independence between the selected bands in different methods and the result is displayed in Fig. 10 . The curves in Fig. 10 indicate that the mutual information between selected bands in proposed method is smaller than those in ABS and JSKF method. This result is expected because the selected bands in our algorithm are based on the NIA idea and the range of the selected bands is more widely than the other two methods. To weight the difference between the selected bands quantitatively, the relative mean square error (RMSE) function is introduced [22], defined as (12) R M S E = r m s e ( f i , f j ) = ∑ ∀ m , n f i ( x , y ) − f j ( x , y ) 2 m a x ∑ ∀ m , n f i ( x , y ) 2 , ∑ ∀ m , n f j ( x , y ) 2 where f i and f f represent the i - t h and j - t h selected bands respectively. The values of RMSE denote the difference of the two images. Now we test the RMSE values between the selected bands in different methods, respectively. The RMSE curves are calculated and displayed in Fig. 11 . The result has demonstrated that the bands selection algorithm in this paper performs better than the other two algorithms. RMSE of the proposed algorithm is larger than the other two algorithms, in other words, the errors between the selected bands in proposed method is more dissimilar than the other two sets of data. As we can know from Fig. 11, the result meets the expectation of bands selection for hyperspectral image. As mentioned above, the second sub-space range from 125th band to 213th band. In this space, the selected results of these three selection algorithms are list in Table 4 . As we can see from Table 4, the selected result of ABS and JSKF are almost the same with the result shown in Table 3 because the selected bands are focus in the center area of the spectrum curve. The result of the proposed has the widest range. To verify the ability of the proposed band selection algorithm, another hyperspectral image is considered and utilized in the following experiment. A hyperspectral image from AVIRIS having 126 bands is utilized to test the proposed algorithm. The size of single band of the hyperspectral image is 256 × 256 and the scene of the image is a military airport, which shown in Fig. 12 . By using the ABS and JSKF band selection algorithms, the results of this hyperspectral image are depicted in Figs. 13 and 14 , respectively. Also, the spectrum information can be divided into four sub-spaces adaptively according to the distribution of the value as shown in Fig. 14. The three sub-spaces are { 1 , 2... , 19 } , { 20 , 21... , 63 } , { 64 , 65... , 126 } and { 96 , 97... , 126 } , respectively. According to the bands selection results of ABS and JSKF, the band selection result of NIA is illustrated in Fig. 15 . In calculation we use a computer with Core2, CPU 2.5 GHz and 2048 Mbytes memory under Windows 7 system. Except the calculation of the correlation coefficients of each two bands, the band selection processes for this hyperspectral image take 4.7281 s. The selection results of ABS, JSKF and NIA are list in Table. 5 , respectively. As we can learn from Table 5, the selection results of ABS concentrate on the range of [21, 31], while the JSKF results concentrate on [2,18]. Furthermore, the selection results of the proposed algorithm have the widest range. As mentioned above, the wide range selection results reserve the visible wave range spectral information approximately. At the aspect of quantitative analysis, the mutual information and relative mean square error are employed to weight the independence and the difference between the selected bands. As shown in Fig. 16 , the mutual information of the between the selected bands by using the proposed algorithm are smaller than those by using ABS and JSKF, which indicates that selected results by NIA are more independent than the other two algorithm. Besides, the RMSE curves displayed in Fig. 17 demonstrates the errors between the selected bands in proposed method is more dissimilar than the other two sets of data. The statistics evaluations and the curves of the experiments above demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is optimal one, especially for the case that abundant anomaly features are contained in the original hyperspectral image. 4 Conclusion We have presented a bands selection algorithm for hyperspectral image by using ABS and JSKF model in this paper. The hyperspectral data is separated into several sub-spaces automatically by employing ABS and JSKF respectively. Subsequently a novel optimal bands selection method NIA (Normalization Index Algorithm) is proposed to select optimal bands. Two weight factors p and q representing background information and anomaly targets information in NIA serve as the valve of the whole algorithm to interpose the ultimate results. Some numerical simulations have demonstrated the validity and superior performance of the proposed bands selection scheme for hyperspectral image.

The CSQDs have been used in many applications, in the optical domain such as QD lasers [7], solar cells [8,9], optical communication [10] and recently for several biological purposes [11]. The different existing shapes for the nanostructures are a consequence of different techniques of growth. For III–V compound semiconductors, we can find pyramidal and lens shapes profile quantum dot [12,13] and due to their complex forms, the calculation of electronic and optical properties of these structures require an extensive theoretical and numerical effort [14,15]. For II–VI quantum dots, the transmission electron microscopy, have shown spherical shapes as shown in Fig. 1 [16] and we also can remark that the CSQDs are not perfectly sphere-shaped. Many theoretical investigations on these structures have been reported and the majority of these authors used the effective mass approximation and have resolved the Schrödinger equation with the spherical coordinates [17–19]. In the present work we have used for modelling CdSe/ZnS CSQDs, both, this method and a mathematical model based on coordinate transformation. The latest model, used in our previous works for modeling different geometrical forms of quantum wires and dots, has given results in agreement with experiment [20–22]. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the details of different methods will be presented. The appropriate choice of coordinate transformation will be also discussed. In Section 3, the electron and hole energy levels, transition energies as well as oscillator strengths are investigated. Finally, conclusions will be presented in Section 4. 2 Theoretical methods 2.1 First mathematical method We consider a spherical quantum dot with a central semiconductor core coated with a larger bandgap semiconductor material acting as a shell. In this core-shell structure the inner radius is denoted by R1 and outer radius by R2 like is shown in Fig. 2 a). The first method consists to resolve the Schrödinger equation of the electron (hole) in the spherical coordinates [23]: (1) − ℏ 2 2 m i * r 2 ∂ ∂ r r 2 ∂ ∂ r + 1 sin θ ∂ ∂ θ sin θ ∂ ∂ θ + 1 sin 2 θ ∂ 2 ∂ ϕ 2 + U p ( r ) ψ n l m ( r , θ , ϕ ) = E ψ n l m ( r , θ , ϕ ) The expression of effective mass m i * and the confined potentials U p ( r ) (Fig. 2b)) of particles is: (2) m i * = m 1 * r ≤ R 1 m 2 * R 1 < r ≤ R 2 (3) U p i ( r ) = 0 r ≤ R 1 V c R 1 < r ≤ R 2 ∞ R 2 < r As the mass and the potential are symmetric spherically, the separation of radial and angular coordinates leads to: (4) ψ n l m ( r , θ , ϕ ) = R n l ( r ) Y l m ( θ , ϕ ) R n l ( r ) is the radial wave function, and Y l m ( θ , ϕ ) is the spherical harmonic, where n is the principal quantum number, l and m are the angular momentum quantum numbers. To achieve the wave function and their corresponding eigenenergy values, the radial function must satisfy the boundary conditions: (5) R n l , 1 ( R 1 ) = R n l , 2 ( R 1 ) and 1 m 1 * d R n l , 1 d r r = R 1 = 1 m 2 * d R n l , 2 d r r = R 1 and the normalization condition: (6) ∫ 0 R 1 r 2 R n l , 1 * R n l , 1 d r + ∫ R 1 R 2 r 2 R n l , 2 * R n l , 2 d r = 1 Two cases need to be considered for the solution of Rnl (r): In the region where E > Up , the solution is a linear combination of spherical Bessel function jl and Neumann function nl and can be written as follows [24]: (7) R n l ( r ) = R n l , 1 = A 1 j l ( k n l , 1 r ) + B 1 n l ( k n l , 1 r ) r ≤ R 1 R n l , 2 = C 1 j l ( k n l , 2 r ) + D 1 n l ( k n l , 2 r ) R 1 < r ≤ R 2 R n l , 3 = 0 r > R 2 Where A1, B1, C1 and D1 are normalized constants and: (8) k n l , 1 = 2 m 1 * E ℏ 2 and k n l , 2 = 2 m 2 * ( E − V c ) ℏ 2 In the region where E < Up , the solution is a linear combination of spherical Bessel function jl , Neumann function nl and Hankel function hl (+) and hl (−) and can be written as follows [24]: (9) R n l ( r ) = R n l , 1 = A 2 j l ( k n l , 1 r ) + B 2 n l ( k n l , 1 r ) r ≤ R 1 R n l , 2 = C 2 h l ( + ) ( i k n l , 2 r ) + D 2 h l ( − ) ( i k n l , 2 r ) R 1 < r ≤ R 2 R n l , 3 = 0 r > R 2 (10) k n l , 1 = 2 m 1 * E ℏ 2 and k n l , 2 = 2 m 2 * ( V c − E ) ℏ 2 2.2 Second mathematical method 2.2.1 The theoretical formulation Our proposed approach for modelling the shape of CSQD shown in Fig. 3 a) and c) in the (x,y) and (z,y) planes, is based on coordinate transformation. The effective mass Schrödinger equation for electrons (holes) in conduction (valence) band in space (x,y,z) is given by: (11) − ℏ 2 2 ∂ ∂ x 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ x + ∂ ∂ y 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ y + ∂ ∂ z 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ z + U p ψ = E ψ where m* is the electron or hole effective mass, Up (x,y,z) is the 3D potential profile determined by the conduction or valence band offset, E and ψ ( x , y , z ) are the quantized energy levels and their corresponding wave function, respectively. We begin by a selection of the coordinate transformation. If ε = ε ( x , y , z ) designates the old coordinate space and β = β ( u , v , w ) the new space with x = x(u,v,w), y = y(u,v,w), z = z(u,v,w). Our purpose is to pass from the old to the new space, an example is shown in Fig. 3. This transformation makes simpler the geometry of the nanostructure leading to flat interfaces in the computational domain. The Schrödinger Eq. (11) can be mapped into β space as: (12) − ℏ 2 2 u x ∂ ψ x 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ u + v x ∂ ψ x 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ v + w x ∂ ψ x 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ w + u y ∂ ψ y 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ u + v y ∂ ψ y 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ v + w y ∂ ψ y 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ w + u z ∂ ψ z 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ u + v z ∂ ψ z 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ v + w z ∂ ψ z 1 ( u , v , w ) ∂ w + U p ψ = E ψ with: (13a) ψ x 1 ( u , v , w ) = u x m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + v x m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + w x m * ∂ ψ ∂ w (13b) ψ y 1 ( u , v , w ) = u y m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + v y m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + w y m * ∂ ψ ∂ w (13c) ψ z 1 ( u , v , w ) = u z m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + v z m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + w z m * ∂ ψ ∂ w In Eqs. (12) and (13a)–(13c): ψ[x(u,v,w), y(u,v,w), z(u,v,w)] = ψ(u,v,w), U  p [x(u,v,w), y(u,v,w), z(u,v,w)] = U  p (u,v,w) while u x , u y , u z , v x , v y , v z , w x , w y and w z are the elements of the Jacobian matrix Jx,y,z representing partial derivatives of the inverse functions u = u(x,y,z), v = v(x,y,z) and w = w(x,y,z) with respect to x, y and z, as example, u x = ∂ u ∂ x The Jacobian matrix Juvw corresponding to the transformation x = x(u,v,w), y = y(u,v,w), z = z(u,v,w) is explicit function on u, v and w: (14) J u v w = x u x v x w y u y v y w z u z v z w where subscripts denote the partial derivatives with respect to u, v and w. Thus, the Jacobian matrix Jxyz for the inverse mapping u = u(x,y,z), v = v(x,y,z) and w = w(x,y,z) given by J x y z = J u v w − 1 , an explicit function on u, v and w: (15) J x y z = u x u y u z v x v y v z w x w y w z = x u x v x w y u y v y w z u z v z w − 1 We can remark that, the elements of matrix J x y z depend on the selected coordinate transformation. For the first step and for the shapes that we have to study, we consider the following form of the transformation: (16a) x = Cu (16b) y = Cf(u,v,w) (16c) z = Cw C is a scaling factor, expressed in nanometers. Thus, we obtain: (17a) J u v w = x u x v x w y u y v y w z u z v z w = C 0 0 C f u C f v C f w 0 0 C (17b) J x y z = u x u y u z v x v y v z w x w y w z = 1 / C 0 0 − f u / ( C f v ) 1 / ( C f v ) − f w / ( C f v ) 0 0 1 / C = 1 C 1 0 0 μ ρ λ 0 0 1 where fu , fv and fw are derivatives of f(u,v,w) with respect to u, v and w. μ = C . v x = − f u / f v , ρ = C . v y = 1 / f v and λ = C . v z = − f w / f v . We note that the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is not zero and we obtain J x y z = J u v w − 1 = C 3 f v ≠ 0 . The second step consists on the mapping of the Hamiltonian into the new coordinate space using the Jacobian matrix for the selected coordinate transformation. In our problem, the Eq. (12) is simplified, using the transformation (17b), and becomes: (18) − ℏ 2 2 C 2 ∂ ∂ u 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + μ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + μ ∂ ∂ v 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + μ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + ρ ∂ ∂ v ρ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + λ ∂ ∂ v λ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ w + ∂ ∂ w λ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ w + U p ψ = E ψ Thus and in the third step, the above equation is discretized using 3D finite difference method. We consider Nu , Nv and Nw the number of points in each direction u, v and w, the discretization equation is given in considering the following in boundary conditions: (19) ψ 0 , j , k = ψ N u + 1 , j , k = 0 ψ i , 0 , k = ψ i , N v + 1 , k = 0 ψ i , j , 0 = ψ i , j , N w + 1 = 0 (20) − ℏ 2 2 C 2 A u u 1 1 m * i + 1 / 2 , j , k − A u u 2 1 m * i − 1 / 2 , j , k + A u v 1 μ m * i + 1 / 2 , j , k − A u v 2 μ m * i − 1 / 2 , j , k + μ i , j , k A v u 1 1 m * i , j + 1 / 2 , k − A v u 2 1 m * i , j − 1 / 2 , k + A v v 1 μ m * i , j + 1 / 2 , k − A v v 2 μ m * i , j − 1 / 2 , k + ρ i , j , k A v v 1 ρ m * i , j + 1 / 2 , k − A v v 2 ρ m * i , j − 1 / 2 , k + λ i , j , k A v v 1 λ m * i , j + 1 / 2 , k − A v v 2 λ m * i , j − 1 / 2 , k + A v w 1 1 m * i , j + 1 / 2 , k − A v w 2 1 m * i , j − 1 / 2 , k + A w v 1 λ m * i , j , k + 1 / 2 − A w v 2 λ m * i , j , k − 1 / 2 + A w w 1 1 m * i , j , k + 1 / 2 − A w w 2 1 m * i , j , k − 1 / 2 + U p i , j , k ψ i , j , k = E i , j , k ψ i , j , k where: (21) A u u 1 = ψ i + 1 , j , k − ψ i , j , k h u 2 , A u v 1 = ψ i + 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 , k − ψ i + 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 , k h u h v , A v u 1 = ψ i + 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 , k − ψ i − 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 , k h v h u A u u 2 = ψ i , j , k − ψ i − 1 , j , k h u 2 , A u v 2 = ψ i − 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 , k − ψ i − 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 , k h u h v , A v u 2 = ψ i + 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 , k − ψ i − 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 , k h v h u A v v 1 = ψ i , j + 1 , k − ψ i , j , k h v 2 , A v w 1 = ψ i , j + 1 / 2 , k + 1 / 2 − ψ i , j + 1 / 2 , k − 1 / 2 h v h w , A w v 1 = ψ i , j + 1 / 2 , k + 1 / 2 − ψ i , j − 1 / 2 , k + 1 / 2 h w h v A v v 2 = ψ i , j , k − ψ i , j − 1 , k h v 2 , A v w 2 = ψ i , j − 1 / 2 , k + 1 / 2 − ψ i , j − 1 / 2 , k − 1 / 2 h v h w , A w v 2 = ψ i , j + 1 / 2 , k − 1 / 2 − ψ i , j − 1 / 2 , k − 1 / 2 h w h v A w w 1 = ψ i , j , k + 1 − ψ i , j , k h w h w , A w w 2 = ψ i , j , k − ψ i , j , k − 1 h w h w In the above expression, i, j and k are indices of the discretization points, while hu, hv and hw are the discretization steps, along u, v and w coordinate, respectively. We obtain a generalized eigenvalue problem, B X = λ X , where X is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ , B is a sparse and band matrix. Once the general forms of the matrices involved is established, there are several computer packages available which can be used to solve this system of equations. In our work we have used the package LAPACK. In the next step, we propose to study the coordinate transformation which can fit the shape of core-shell quantum dot 2.2.2 Choice of the coordinate transformation In this part, we will be interested to adjust the different parameters to find a realistic approach for CSQD shapes, and we propose to use the following coordinate transformation: (22a) x = C u (22b) y = C sinh ( A . v ) K cosh ( B u ) cosh ( D . w ) , is the detailed expression of 16b (22c) z = C w Let us study the effect of parameters A, B, D and K on the shape of the quantum dot for fixed value of v = 1.5 and C = 1 nm. From Fig. 4 a) and b), we can note that the peak of the function increases with A, however, an increase in K, leads to a decrease in the hauteur of the function. When we increase the couple B, D, the width of quantum dot decreases, like is shown in Fig. 4c). The variable v plays an important role on form of quantum dot. For fixed values of A, K, B and D, the peak and the width of the function increases with positive values of v. The function is also decreases and is negative with negative values, as shown in Fig. 5 . Also, we can notice that the function is symmetric with respect to the axes u and w and finally we can conclude that the parameters A, K, B, D and the variable v, playing a very important role on the fitting of the shape of core shell quantum dot. It is therefore relatively easy to plot a geometrical form of CSQD. The CSQD profile in ε -space shown in Fig. 3a) and c) in the (x,y) and (z,y) planes respectively, are mapped in the β -space, the corresponding computational domains are in (u,v) and (w,v) planes (Fig. 3b) and d)) and it is therefore a parallelepiped. For fixed values of parameters A, K, B, D and C, the real dimensions of core and shell depend of the variation of computational domain in u, the variation domain in v and the variation domain in w and therefore we have: D C o r e u = [ u 1 , u 2 ] , D C o r e v = [ v 1 , v 2 ] , D C o r e w = [ w 1 , w 2 ] , D S h e l l u = [ u 3 , u 4 ] , D S h e l l v = [ v 3 , v 4 ] and D S h e l l w = [ w 3 , w 4 ] , which corresponds in ε -space to D C o r e x = [ x 1 , x 2 ] , D C o r e y = [ y 1 , y 2 ] , D C o r e z = [ z 1 , z 2 ] , D S h e l l x = [ x 3 , x 4 ] , D S h e l l y = [ y 3 , y 4 ] , D S h e l l z = [ z 3 , z 4 ] with: x 2 − x 1 2 = a S x 4 − x 3 2 = a C z 2 − z 1 2 = c S z 4 − z 3 2 = c C y 2 − y 1 2 = b S y 4 − y 3 2 = b C Due to complex form of CSQDs, the resolution of Schrödinger equation in ε -space is very difficult and this transformation makes it easier in β -space using the finite difference method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Energy levels We start our work with numerical simulation of the electron and hole energy levels for the spherical quantum dot using the first method. The effects of the core and shell sizes on the energy levels have been studied. The parameters used in our calculations are listed in Table 1 [25]. We note that the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum of the different cores are taken as references for electron and hole energy levels respectively. Fig. 6 a) illustrates the effect of core thickness for fixed value of shell width in CdSe/ZnS CSQD. We can remark that the electron and hole energies decrease when increasing the core radius. It is straightforward to mention from Fig. 6b) that the electron energy shows the same behaviour with the shell thickness at fixed value of core width. The hole energy is insensitive to core thickness change. These same behaviours of charge carriers have been underlined in the works of Zgaren et al for CdSe/ZnS CSQD and for different II-VI nanocrystals [26]. In the target to compare the two proposed methods for the same widths of the two shapes of CSQD illustrated in Fig. 7 , our calculated values of energy levels for electrons and holes are listed in Table 2 . We have considered three dimensions of the CSQD, with R1  = aC  = bC  = cC and R2  = aS  = bS  = cS . E1e (E1h ) and E2e (E2h ) are the electron (hole) energy levels using the first and the second approaches. As can be seen, the energies are very similar for 2 nm and 4 nm core and shell thicknesses respectively. However, the discrepancy increases with the core and shell sizes, the ratios E 2 e − E 1 e E 1 e and E 2 h − E 1 h E 1 h reach 80% for electrons and 100% for holes with 4nm and 6nm core and shell thicknesses. This behaviour can be explained by the difference between the geometric shapes and the volume of the two CSQD forms used in this work. In the aim to achieve the same electron energies E1e , obtained with the first method (Table 2), we have examined the new dimensions of modelled shape and we have calculated the new energies using the second theoretical approach. The corrected values of the thickness listed in Table 3 are a’C  = b’C  = c’C  = 2.15, 3.85 and 5.15 nm for the core and a’S  = b’S  = c’S  = 4.3, 6.41 and 7.72nm for the shell. We can note that, the ratio between the new and the old dimensions is of 1.075, 1.283 1.287 for the first, the second and the third structure respectively. The new hole energy values E 2 h * calculated with the second method (Table 4 ), for the different corrected structures, are in agreement with those (E1h ) obtained with spherical CSQDs (Table 2), the ratio E 2 h * − E 1 h E 1 h does not exceed 5.9%. 3.2 Optical properties: transition energy, wavelength and oscillator strength The new dimensions of CSQD listed in Table 3 are used to study and carry out the quantum efficiency of a transition. We have calculated the corresponding transition energies, wavelengths and the oscillator strengths given by the expression [22,27]: (23) f m → k = 2 m 0 ℏ 2 ( E m − E k ) 〈 ψ m l ψ k 〉 2 where (Em – Ek) is the energy difference between the initial ψm and final ψk states and 〈 ψ m l ψ k 〉 is the dipole matrix element of the transition between the initial and the final states. In our case we are interesting on the interband transition, m0 is the free electron effective mass. The results are listed in Table 4. The transition energy decreases with core thickness and varies in the range 1.912–2.245 eV, which corresponds to emission wavelength range 0.648–0.552 μ m . Many experimental data with photoluminescence spectra confirmed these results [28–31]. In the Ref. [28] for example, the authors mentioned that the emission wavelength found for quantum dot sizes 2.4 ± 0.2 n m , 2.9 ± 0.4 n m and 4.4 ± 0.9 n m , are 0.504 ± 0.006 μ m , 0.537 ± 0.006 μ m and 0.590 ± 0.030 μ m respectively. For better comparison with the experience, we must take into account the effect of the coulomb interaction. The corresponding oscillator strength values decrease when the transition energies augment. This behavior can be explained by a decrease in overlap wave functions. In contrast to the first mathematical method presented in this manuscript, the second has the advantage of being able to be applied for non-concentric core shell and can be developed for others CSQDs and auto-organized quantum dots. 4 Conclusions We have presented in this paper two mathematical methods to model the core-shell quantum dots. The first is based in the spherical coordinate, the second on a coordinate transformation. The energy levels for corrected structures are in agreement with experimental data and can be generalized for others CSQD. The obtained wavelength range 0.552–0.648 μ m achieved with the spherical CSQD and the adjusted structure modeled with second method is very important for solar cells conception. Our proposed method has the advantage of being able to be developed for auto-organized quantum dots. It offers a fast and inexpensive way to check device designs and processes and can provide good guidance for the selection of CSQD parameters to experimental studies. ", [1] S. Mathew B.S.

Analysis of peak voltage result, which was obtained by moving a sensing port displacement from a fixed concave mirror (CM) was found to be useful to detect a magnesium ion concentration, which is filled in between the probe and target. The proposed sensor is capable for measuring magnesium ion with variation of concentration 0–5%. The resolution of the sensor can be achieved at 0.2%. It was also observed that the use of CM with a longer focal length improves the sensitivity of the sensor. The high sensitivity, the small size, the ease fabrication process, and the bio-compatibility of the proposed device are appealing characteristics that makes it ideal for practical bio-sensing applications.",Apr-18," Keywords Fiber coupler Displacement sensor Concave mirror Refraction 1 Introduction Detections of refractive index and concentration of liquid solution have widely been reported using various fiber-optic sensors [1–5]. Owing to the intrinsic characteristics of the optical fiber, these sensors are in general simple to fabricate, compact, robust, immune to electromagnetic radiation, chemical and biological inert, and can be integrated in complex networks for real-time multiple parameter sensing. In recent years, many important advances were achieved in the fiber optic sensor technology; in terms of sensitivity, resolution, dynamic range, response time, signal to noise ratio and fabrication techniques. These advances have also promoted the development of optical fiber chemical sensors and biosensors [1,2]. For instance, the side-emitting technique was conducted using fiber optic micro-bend [3] and tapered fiber [4] to detect refractive index of chlorinated water and concentration of uric acid, respectively. Optical fibers coated with silver thin layer [5] and nanocomposite of ZnO-polypyrrol [6] were also used to detect concentration of uric acid and manganese ion based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Coreless fiber [7] and thin core fiber [8] connected to single mode fiber were used to detect concentration of sucrose and refractive index of solution, respectively. A method based on displacement sensor can also be used to measure the concentration or refractive index of solution. For instance, a displacement sensor with a bundled fiber probe was capable of measuring refractive of solution [9], glucose concentration [10], calcium [11] and salinity [12]. This type of sensor works based on detection the output voltage as the displacement between sensor probe and mirror immersed in liquid of the solution sample is varied. Fiber coupler is an optical device that can be used to split a beam of light. It was used as a displacement sensor using a mirror as a target [13]. Based on the displacement sensor, fiber coupler was also employed as a level sensor [14] and a Rhodamine B concentration sensor [15] using a concave mirror (CM) as a target in conjunction with a green light source. In this paper, we propose a new displacement sensor for measuring magnesium ion concentration using a fiber coupler as a probe and a concave mirror as a target. The magnesium ions detection is explored in this study since the ion is very important for the human in energy metabolism process, protein synthesis, muscle contraction, fat breakdown, DNA stability, and cell growth. Lack of magnesium ions in the body will affect health even can cause disease and cancer [16]. Therefore, the magnesium ions sensing device is becoming important especially for the food and beverage industry in order to meet the needs of magnesium ions that are perceived by the body. 2 Working principle of the sensor Mechanism of magnesium ion detection using fiber coupler and concave mirror (CM) is shown in Fig. 1 . Light source of the laser is coupled to input port of the coupler, part of the output light beam from the sensing port (Pe ) enter to concave mirror. Medium between sensor port and CM is the testing sample. Partial of the reflected light beam from CM passed through a sensing port (Pb ) and then transmitted to the detection port (Pd ). The distance between sensing port and CM is attributed by d. If position of sensing port is changed in relation to CM, then the detected optical power as function of d is given by [15]; (1) P d = P 0 1 − exp − 2 d − f 2 / f 2 d 2 − 2 d f d − f a tan sin − 1 N A n + 1 2 where a, NA, f and n is core of radius, numerical aperture, focal length of CM and refractive index of medium between sensing port and CM, respectively. P0 can be written by equation as follows; (2) P 0 = 1.15 c r 1 − c r 10 − 0.1 L e − 2 × 10 − 0.1 D 2 P i n , where cr, Le , and D are coupling ratio, excess loss, and directivity of fiber coupler respectively. While Pin optical power of the laser which is coupled to input port [13]. Optical power of laser is measured by an optical detector using digital voltmeter in term of output voltage (Pd ). Output power is proportional to output voltage. When Eq. (1) is simulated, we can obtain the curve showing the relationship between output voltage (V) and d. The curve also indicates a peak voltage at a certain location. The value of Vp increase with refractive index of medium. If we assumed that refractive index is a linear function to magnesium ion concentration in solution as a medium, then the test sample of magnesium ion concentration can be read from the peak voltage. Variation of position scanning between sensing port and concave mirror is used to obtained peak voltage. 3 Experimental Setup The schematic experimental setup for the proposed magnesium ion concentration sensor is shown in Fig. 2 . It consists of a He-Ne laser (with wavelength of 632.8nm and maximum power of 10mW), fiber coupler and silicon detector. The fiber coupler probe was constructed from a multimode plastic fiber with structure 2×2, diameter of 1mm, 50/50 splitting ratio, 4dB insertion loss and 1.6dB excess loss. A CM with two different focal length 4.5 and 6mm was used as reflector. CM was placed on the bottom sample tube with diameter of 4cm and 3cm height. The positioning of the fiber coupler sensing port was accomplished by mounting it on a micro-displacement meter, which was rigidly attached to a vibration free table. Light from the fiber coupler input port was coupled into the sensing port. The signal from sensing port was measured by moving the probe away from the zero point, where the reflective surface of concave mirror and the probe were in close contact. The signal from the optical detector was converted into voltage and was measured by a digital voltmeter. The output intensity was measured by changing the position of the fiber coupler sensing port, which functions as probe from 0 to 15mm in step of 100μm. The measurements were carried out for magnesium ion with concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5%. During the experiment, temperature was kept constant to that error due to temperature fluctuation is negligible. 4 Result and Discussion Detection of magnesium ion concentration was obtained by monitoring the output voltage while the displacement between the sensing port and CM is varied. The initial position of the sensing port is about 2mm above the center of the CM. The curves related to the output voltage as function of displacement sensing port was measured for two different CMs for comparison purpose. The results are analyzed and plotted as shown in Fig. 3 . Figs. 3(a) and (b) shows the displacement curves with CM1 and CM2, which has a focal length 6 and 12mm, respectively. The measurement error for both curves is obtained at around 0.6mV. It is shown that the peak voltage position was obtained at around 7.0mm and 9.5mm for the displacement curves with CM1 and CM2, respectively. It is worthy to note that CM 1 and CM 2 has a diameter of 9.0mm and 12.0mm, respectively. In the experiment, the starting position of sensing port was at 2.0m from surface of concave mirror. Compare to reference of 12, the main novelty of the proposed setup is applying fiber coupler probe as element sensing. In this probe, we have a first peak voltage at very close distance, therefore the sensor is suitable for a shorter distance measurement. Figs. 4 (a) and (b) show the peak voltage position at various magnesium ion concentrations for CM1 and CM2 target respectively. It is shown from both figures that peak voltage position changes irregularly with the variation of magnesium ion concentration. Therefore, it is difficult to predict magnesium ion concentration using the peak voltage position. Correlation between peak voltage value and magnesium ion concentration is shown in Fig. 5 . It indicates a linear trend relation between the peak voltage and magnesium ion concentration. The linearity is more than 99%. Therefore, we can determine value of concentration based on value of peak voltage. Slope of the curve in Fig. 5 defines sensitivity of the sensor, which indicates CM2 produces a better sensitivity than that of CM1. This is attributed to the longer focal length that allows the sensing fiber port to collect more light and increases the sensitivity. The refractive index of various magnesium ion concentrations was also measured using Abbe refractometer and the result is summarized in Fig. 6 . The result shows that the refractive index is linearly correlated with the concentration. Therefore, this approach can be used for detection of magnesium ion concentration. The stability of the sensor was then tested for 720s for each interval 30s and the result is presented in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 shows the sensor has a high stability with standard of deviation is 0.4mV (0.1%) and 0.5mV (0.11%) for CM 1 and CM 2, respectively. Resolution of the sensor is defined by ratio of standard deviation over sensitivity (slope of the linear curve). Overall, performance of the proposed magnesium ion concentration sensor using fiber coupler probe for CM 1 and CM 2 is summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 shows that sensitivity of the sensor with CM 1 is higher than sensor with CM 2, therefore the sensor resolution with CM 2 is lower than CM 1 (1/1.5 times). The results indicate that fiber coupler based displacement sensor can be used for detection of magnesium ion concentration. During the experiment, the error due to this temperature variation is negligible as the temperature is kept constant at 25°C. Based on a simple calculation, a response time or bandwidth of optical detector is used in this experiment can be found at 0.175kHz. 5 Conclusion Fiber optic coupler based displacement sensor configured with CM was proposed and demonstrated for detection of magnesium ion concentration. The results shows that a peak voltage of the sensor is linear to the concentration with the best resolution is obtained at 0.2% and range of 0–5%. The use of CM with a longer focal length improves the sensitivity of the sensor. The simplicity and low cost of the sensor make it suitable for various industrial applications.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.022,"Electromagnetic radiation analysis of planar, segmented and circular array antenna in THz applications","Abstract The electromagnetic radiation of three types of antenna arrays, such as planar, three-segmented and circular are designed, analyzed and compared in view of their applications in communication systems for THz applications. Each array consists of a number of sub-arrays which consists of vertical linear arrays of patch antennas, with certain values of intensities and phase distributions that determine the shape of beam in vertical direction. In this paper, the ranges of angles for beam scanning of planar array, segmented array and circular array are simulated with MATLAB in Terahertz frequency range. The beam steering capabilities of each array are analyzed and a comparative analysis at 1THz frequency is reported.",Apr-18," Keywords Microstrip antennas Adaptive arrays Beam steering Scanning angle range Electromagnetic radiation 1 Introduction The antennas with beamsteering facility make them intelligent by improving range and channel capacity while reducing the interference. These types of antennas have significantly huge application in military and space systems. With advanced techniques of antenna fabrication, beamsteering can be achieved with less complex and compact patch antennas. Several applications of continuous millimetre (mm) and sub-millimetre (smm) wave signals with photonics technology attract great attention in recent research [1–3]. The factors like high-speed measurements, spectroscopy techniques, with wireless communications, also the supply of local signals for radio telescopes are discussed. A uni-travelling carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) with log-periodic toothed wide band antenna generates mm and smm waves at terahertz frequencies were investigated by Hiroshi Ito et al. [4]. A thorough research of the operational characteristics of the UTC-PD reveals the use of electron-velocity overshoot on the depletion layer is important for increasing the output power in the THz frequency range. Photomixers which produce high-frequency signals with photoconductive switch using low-temperature-grown GaAs (LT-GaAs) are most widely used [5,6]. Also, sub-millimetre wave generation at up to 5 THz has been reported, though with quick response the device can also work for long-wavelength (λ ≈ 0.8 μm) light signal [7]. A dual band dipole antenna in THz frequency range, with a novel small flat quartz-copper reflector has been reported [8]. Such an antenna supports maximum gain of 12.4 dB at 5.2 THz frequency with two main resonant frequencies at 2.58 THz and 5.33 THz, and can be used as an array element in linear and planar sets of elements, which were evaluated by using array techniques. This enables high conversion efficiency from dc to radiated power in THz range. The design evolution of the distributed active radiator (DAR) follows from an inverse design approach. On the other hand, a two dimensional 4 × 4 radiating antenna without high-resistivity substrate array has been implemented in 45 nm SOI CMOS and it radiates with a maximum gain of 9.4 dB at 0.28 THz. Also beam steering capabilities in 2-dimension over 80° in both azimuth and elevation has been reported in this work [9]. This chip dissipates 820 mW of DC power and reported integrated beam-scanning array at THz frequencies in silicon. In the past few years, research activities in the terahertz frequency range (0.3–3 THz) led to the development of several applications ranging from ultrafast wireless communication, imaging, low-cost diagnostics to remote sensing, spectroscopy and quality control [10,11]. A polymide based optical MPA at THz frequency has been presented and discussed [12]. This proposed antenna with 5.22 dB gain has impedance bandwidth 40.16 GHz and applicable for video rate imaging system and homeland defence applications which has frequency range 0.6 THz–0.8 THz. Another THz patch antenna based on Graphene nano ribbon on polymide substrate has been presented by S. Anand et al. and its radiation characteristics are analyzed in 0.725 THz–0.775 THz band, a bandwidth of 50 GHz [13]. Such terahertz antenna system can generate and transmit at high data rates, low transmitted power with secured wireless communication. Yagi antenna with a graphene loop added to dipole radiator in 1 THz frequency range can achieve high gain [14]. There is a demand for antennas that can transmit signals at higher data rates as wireless communications are shifting attention towards frequencies above 100 GHz. Higher Q- factor, higher bandwidth with high gain pattern are the benefits of the novel structure that are important in THz systems. Kallnichev studied the beam-steering and directive characteristics of adaptive antenna arrays in microwave region [15]. By proper consideration of antenna array parameters this work can be extended in THz region, as this region of EM spectrum is attracting more and more attention due to its capability of carrying high data rate. In this paper, electromagnetic radiation-patterns of two dimensional planar, three-segmented and circular antenna arrays have been analysed and simulated. Their radiation patterns are compared in the THz frequency band for photonics applications. 2 Theoretical analysis Three simple configurations of antenna array systems are planar array, three segment array and circular array [16]. The analysis of electromagnetic radiation patterns of these three configurations has been presented with comparison. In this paper, by considering N × M two dimensional antenna arrays which is consisting of N number vertical linear subarrays of M number of antennas. In planar array, antennas are arranged along a plane with vertical separation dh as shown in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 2 , a three-segment array in a quasi-planar structure has been shown, in which two edge segments are bent. For circular array, equally spaced N vertical subarrays along with arc of radius ‘r’ are formed as shown in Fig.3 . The length and width sizes are determined for each radiating patch are L = 39.5 μm and W = 56.8 μm, with the impedance matching at central frequency at 1 THz, which is applicable for beam steering antenna. In this section theoretical analysis of each configuration with electromagnetic radiation pattern has been presented. 2.1 Planar array antenna A planar array of N × M elements can produce a large aperture, and can be used for generating directional beam. The directional beam thus produced can be controlled by varying the relative phase of each radiator. Planar arrays provide more number of symmetrical patterns with lower side lobes. It has high directivity with narrow main directional beam. As shown in Fig. 1 the elemental antennas are arranged along a plane and formed an N × M planar array. The vertical spacing between two elements is dv and the horizontal spacing is dh. The radiation pattern of this array is given by Eq. (1). (1) F p l θ , ∅ = ∑ m = 1 M ∑ n = 1 N e j ( m - 1 ) ( k d v . c o s θ . s i n ∅ + δ m ) F n m θ , ∅ . e j ( n - 1 ) ( k d h s i n θ . c o s ∅ + δ n ) where δm and δn are the phase difference in adjacent element or progressive phase shift in vertical and horizontal direction respectively. Fnm (θ, ∅ ) is the radiation pattern of a patch radiator, located in nth column and mth row and given by Eq. (2).

The rectangular patch radiator has width ‘w’ and effective length ‘Le’. The Radiation pattern of planar array with main beam steer in the direction (θ0, ∅ 0) is given by Eq. (3). (3) F p l θ , ∅ = ∑ m = 1 M ∑ n = 1 N F n m θ , ∅ . e j k d v ( m - 1 ) ( c o s θ . s i n ∅ - c o s θ ° ) . e j k d h ( n - 1 ) ( s i n θ . c o s ∅ - s i n θ ° c o s ∅ ° ) 2.2 Three segmented array antenna To increase the scanning range of planar array in a three segment array antenna, two edges of planar array are bent and oriented them at same angle ∅ b with respect to the central planar array. Front and top view of three segment array is shown in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. In this case two edge subarrays of planar array bent at an angle ∅ b. The central segment contains several sub-arrays and act as a planar array. The analysis of electromagnetic radiation of a three segment array antenna is quite similar to that of circular structure. The reference point is selected at the intersection of two perpendiculars through the midpoints of two side segments as shown in Fig. 3. The distance of each radiating element from midpoint is r1, r2, r3, r4 and r5 respectively and ∅ 1 , ∅ 2 , ∅ 3 , ∅ 4 and ∅ 5 are respective angles in between the adjacent radiator.The electromagnetic radiation pattern of three segmented array antenna is given by Eq.

F 1 , n m θ , ∅ 1 , n m . e j ( k r n s i n θ . c o s ∅ + δ n ) where δm and δn are the phase differences in adjacent element or progressive phase shift in vertical and horizontal direction respectively. Three segment array antenna considered in our study contains five columns and five rows as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , with r1, r2, r3, r4 and r5 respectively representing the distances of sub-arrays from the centre, which are given by Eqs. (5)–(7). (5) r 1 = r 5 = 0.5 d n 3 + cos ∅ b sin ∅ b (6) r 2 = r 4 = 0.5 d n 5 1 + c o s 2 ∅ b + 6 c o s ∅ b sin ∅ b (7) r 3 = 0.5 d n 1 + 3 cos ∅ b sin ∅ b and angles between the adjacent radiator are calculated by following Eqs.

(14) is the radiation pattern equation for five columns & five rows of segmented array. 2.3 Circular array antenna Circular array consists of a set of identical rectangular patches which are uniformly spaced around a circle with radius ‘r’. Schematic diagram of circular array has been presented in Fig. 4. In the present analysis, equally spaced N vertical subarrays are arranged along an arc of radius ‘r’. Radiation pattern of this type of circular array is given by Eq. (4). (15) F c i r c u l a r θ , ∅ = ∑ m = 1 M ∑ n = 1 N e j m - 1 k d v c o s θ s i n ∅ + δ m .

F 1 , n m e j k r s i n θ c o s ∅ - ∅ n - s i n θ ° c o s ∅ ° - ∅ n 3 Result and analysis The electromagnetic radiation patterns of the planar, three-segment and circular array antennas have been analyzed using Eqs. (3), (14) and (17) respectively. 3.1 Analysis of planar array The elevation angle is fixed at θ = θ° = 90° in the one dimensional azimuth beam tracking characteristics. The presented results are obtained by considering N = 5 of vertical subarrays for three types of array configurations. In this case, the subarrays are placed side by side and separation of midline by spacing of dh = 0.5 λ. Each column subarray contains M = 5 patches with uniform magnitude and phase distribution. The vertical spacing between patches are dv = 0.8 λ, in order to obtain a 3 dB beam width about 16° in the elevation. The length and width are determined for each radiating patch which are L = 39.5 μm and W = 56.8 μm, with the impedance matching at central frequency (1 THz), which is applicable for beam steering antenna. The radiation pattern of beam steering antenna in planar array configuration with N linear subarrays of M patch radiators is the product of the space factor and element pattern of planar configuration array antenna. The directive beams of planar array consisting N × M i.e. 5 × 5 and at 1 THz frequency, with varying ∅ in different angles(π/2,π/3 and π/6) is shown in Fig. 5 . Planar array with 5 subarrays has achieved the scanning angles π/2, π/3 and π/6 with high gain and directivity. 3.2 Analysis of three-segment array The three segment array consists of planar array with two edges are bent and oriented at same angle ∅ b with respect to the central planar array. The central segment only acts as planar array. The normalized patterns for the 3-segment array antenna with bend angle of ∅ b = 45◦has shown in Fig. 6 . The electromagnetic radiation pattern of five subarrays segmented array antenna analysis has been carried for ∅ =π/2, ∅ = π /3 and ∅ = π /8 as shown in Fig. 6. The 3 segmented array structure has capability to steer the radiation pattern up to π /8 which is better than planar array as shown in Fig. 5. The column subarrays had the radii, a1 = a5 = 1.31 λ, a2 = a4 = 1.21 λ, a3 = 1.1 λ and angle coordinates are ∅ 1 = 45◦, ∅ 2 = 65.6◦, ∅ 3 = 90◦, ∅ 4 = 114.4◦ and ∅ 5 = 135◦. 3.3 Analysis of circular array For the circular array antenna,the radius of the circular arc, r = 0.95 λ has been selected to for 30° angular separation between the adjacent columns, with their angular coordinates were ∅ 1 = π/6, ∅ 2 = π/3, ∅ 3 = π/2, ∅ 4 = −π/3 and ∅ 5 = −π/6. The directive beam is steered from ∅  = π/2 to ∅  = 0 plane but the beamwidth and sidelobe levels both are increased, consequently both, gain and directivity decreased.The azimuth plane normalized radiation patterns of circular array are calculated for the values of ∅ 0 = π/2, π/3 and π/12 as shown in Fig. 7 . The circular array can steer the beam up to π/12, which is much better than planar and segmented array. Yet both gain and directivity are reduced. Scanning range is improved. But fabrication of circular array is more difficult than planar and segmented array. Similar simulations can be carried out for larger values of M and N like for larger array N ≥ 9 sub-arrays, the planar configurations are to be more preferred as the aperture size of it is enough to provide the required scan of 120°, also it has highest directivity as compared to circular and segmented curved structures. 4 Conclusion In this paper the electromagnetic radiation patterns of three different configurations of adaptive array antennas have been analyzed and compared with respect to their beam scanning capabilities in terahertz range. All three systems of planar, 3-segmented and circular array antennas are formed using same vertical linear sub-arrays of microstrip patch radiators. The planar array is providing scanning angles of π/2, π/3 and π/6. In case of 3-segmented array, scanning range capabilities increased and it can scan up to π/8. In case of circular array, it is found that beam scanning capability increased drastically and it can scan from π/2 to 0, which is better than planar array and segmented array. The three segment array has a narrower beam than that of circular array, which gives better directivity. The analysis has carried out for 1 THz frequency. Similar analysis can be carried out for 0.3–3 THz frequency range with more number of radiating patches. Acknowledgments Authors would like to thank Dr. Kh. S. Singh, Reader, D. J.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.030,Numerical modelling of auto-organized InAs/ InP quantum wires with different shapes,"Abstract In this paper, energy levels of electrons and holes for different shapes of isolated and self-organized InAs/InP quantum wire are calculated. We have used a theoretical method based on the coordinate transformation employing a newly analytical function to resolve the Schrödinger equation. The purpose of this work is to show how the shape of the quantum wire depend on the parameters introduced in the function and to discuss the effect of the wire height on the energy levels. The optical transitions energies are also investigated.",Apr-18," Keywords InAs/InP Coordinate transformation FDM Transition energy 1 Introduction In the past few years, the low-dimensional semiconductor structures like quantum dots, quantum wires, and quantum wells have aroused much attention due to their fundamental properties and their wide range application such as light emitting diodes [1–3], solar cells [4,5], medicine [6,7] and quantum computing [8]. Among them, the quantum wires, the charge carriers (electrons and holes) are confined in two dimensions. The quantum confinement of carriers in QWs leads to spectrally sharp energy levels depending on the shape and the size of quantum wires. Using the growth techniques of semiconductor nanostructures like molecular-beam epitaxy [9], it was possible to obtain a certain type of cross-sections such as dome, lens-shaped, T-shaped [10], elliptical [11] and V-groove quantum wires [12–15]. These quantum wires have been obtained in a variety of materials such as GaAs/AlGaAs [16–19], InAs/InP [20] and InGaAs/GaAs [21]. Many theoretical and numerical methods are used for modelling and simulating such different shapes and forms of isolated and self-organized quantum wires [22]. In this paper, focus will be on the modelling of different shapes of InAs quantum wire embedded in InP matrix. We will also study its electronic properties, suggesting a numerical method based on the combination of coordinate transformation and the FDM. In the second section, we will present the description of this method, exposing the choice of coordinate transformation which can model the structures of dome and lens-shaped quantum wire. In the third section, we will investigate the influence of the quantum wire shape and height on the electron and hole energy levels, and transition energies. In Section 4, we will finalise by drawing the conclusions of this paper. 2 Theoretical method 2.1 Theoretical formulation In the following, we present a general and theoretical method for modelling a semiconductor quantum wire with different geometrical shapes in order to investigate their properties. We start from the envelope function approximation (EFA) 2D Schrödinger equation for electrons (holes) in conduction (valence) band: (1) − ℏ 2 2 ∇ 1 m * x , y ∇ ψ x , y + V x , y ψ x , y = E ψ x , y We can obtain the electron (hole) energy levels E and their corresponding wave function ψ ( x , y ) by solving this equation. where ψ x , y is the varying part of the total wave function, m* is the electron or hole effective mass, E is the confinement energy and V x , y is the total potential which is given by: V x , y = ℏ 2 k z 2 2 m * + V p x , y V p x , y is the 2D potential profile determined by the conduction or valence band offset, we can write Eq. (1) as: (2) − ℏ 2 2 ∂ ∂ x 1 m x , y * ∂ ψ ( x , y ) ∂ x + ∂ ∂ y 1 m x , y * ∂ ψ ( x , y ) ∂ y + ℏ 2 k z 2 2 m * + V p ( x , y ) ψ ( x , y ) = E ψ ( x , y ) The first step of the method consists of a selection of the coordinate transformation that can provide a good fit of the shape and size of the computational domain. Once the coordinate transformation x = x u , v and y = y u , v is chosen. Consequently, Eq. (2) becomes: (3) − ℏ 2 2 u x ∂ ∂ u u x m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + v x m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + v x ∂ ∂ v u x m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + v x m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + u y ∂ ∂ u u y m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + v y m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + v y ∂ ∂ v u y m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + v y m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + U ψ = E ψ where (4) ∂ ∂ x = ∂ ∂ u ∂ u ∂ x + ∂ ∂ v ∂ v ∂ x = ∂ ∂ u u x + ∂ ∂ v v x (5) ∂ ∂ y = ∂ ∂ u ∂ u ∂ y + ∂ ∂ v ∂ v ∂ y = ∂ ∂ u u y + ∂ ∂ v v y In Eq. (3), ψ x ( u , v ) , y ( u , v ) = ψ ( u , v ) , U p x ( u , v ) , y ( u , v ) = U p ( u , v ) while ux, uy, vx and vy are the elements of the Jacobian matrix Jx,y representing partial derivatives of the inverse functions u = u x , y and v = v x , y with respect to x and y. The Jacobian matrix Juv corresponding to the transformation x = x u , v , y = y u , v is an explicit function on u and v: (6) J u v = x u x v y u y v Here x u / y u and x v / y v denote the partial derivatives to u and v respectively. Jxy is the Jacobian matrix for the inverse mapping u = u(x,y) and v = v(x,y), which is an explicit function on u and v. It is given by J x y = J u v − 1 , we finally derive Jxy as: (7) J x y = u x u y v x v y = x u x v y u y v − 1 Therefore, the coordinate transformation which can fit lens and dome shapes and determine the computational domain can be written in this general form: (8a) x = K u (8b) y = K f u , v We note that K is a factor related to the scale and expressed in nanometers. Thus, we obtain: (9a) J u v = x u x v y u y v = K 0 K f u K f v (9b) J x y = u x u y v x v y = 1 / K 0 − f u / ( K f v ) 1 / ( K f v ) = 1 K 1 0 μ ρ Where fu and fv are derivatives of f(u,v) with respect to u and v. μ = K . v x = − f u / f v a n d ρ = K . v y = 1 / f v By using the expressions of μ and ρ , the Eq. (3) can be expressed as follows : (10) − ℏ 2 2 K 2 ∂ ∂ u 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + μ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + μ ∂ ∂ v 1 m * ∂ ψ ∂ u + μ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + ρ ∂ ∂ v ρ m * ∂ ψ ∂ v + U ψ = E ψ In the second step, the above equation is solved using 2D finite difference method and the Eq. (10) becomes: (11) − ℏ 2 2 K 2 1 h u 1 m * i + 1 / 2 , j ψ i + 1 , j − ψ i , j h u − 1 m * i − 1 / 2 , j ψ i , j − ψ i − 1 , j h u + μ m * i + 1 / 2 , j ψ i + 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 − ψ i + 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 h v − μ m * i − 1 / 2 ψ i − 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 − ψ i − 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 h v + μ i , j h v 1 m * i , j + 1 / 2 ψ i + 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 − ψ i − 1 / 2 , j + 1 / 2 h u − 1 m * i , j − 1 / 2 ψ i + 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 − ψ i − 1 / 2 , j − 1 / 2 h u + μ m * i , j + 1 / 2 ψ i , j + 1 − ψ i , j h v − μ m * i , j − 1 / 2 ψ i , j − ψ i , j − 1 h v + ρ i , j h v ρ m * i , j + 1 / 2 ψ i , j + 1 − ψ i , j h v − ρ m * i , j − 1 / 2 ψ i , j − ψ i , j − 1 h v + U i , j ψ i , j = E ψ i , j Where i and j are indices of the discretization points, while hu is the discretization step along u coordinate and hv along v coordinate. 2.2 Coordinate transformation In this section, we propose to study the coordinate transformation which is given as follows: (12) x = K u y = K f u , v = sinh ( A v ) D + arctan h ( K sin 2 ( π u L ) ) ( 1 + B v 2 ) Fig. 1 shows the manner each parameters in coordinate transformation (Eq. (12)) influences the shape of the function f u , v , for a fixed value of v = 2 . In Fig. 1a) and b), we can see that A affects the peak of the function, which increases with A but decreases when the D parameter augments. The B parameter controls the shape width of quantum wire. An increase in B leads to a decrease in the curve width as shown in Fig. 1c). As can be seen in Fig. 1d), for fixed values of A, D and B, the maximum of the curve increases with v . The function given by relation (Eq. (12)) has the advantage of modelling one or more quantum wires, the part sin 2 π u L is related to the periodicity, which gives us more than one quantum wire. We have taken, for example, three and five quantum wires and we suggest two models of this structure. Where ε = ε x , y represents the old coordinate space, the Schrödinger equation can be mapped into new β = β u , v space. In Fig. 2 a) and b), we have presented the two models of the quantum wire. The first model, shown in Fig. 2a), has a dome-like shape. In addition, the second model in Fig. 2a) has the form of lens cross-section. We observe from the figures that the two models are obtained when the parameter v varies between the 0 , 2 and − 1 , 1 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 2c) and d), a three quantum wires self-organized have the first and the second forms respectively. A five quantum wires which have a dome-like shape and a lens cross-section shape are shown in Fig. 2e) and f) respectively. The InAs/InP QW profiles in ε-space illustrated in Fig. 2 in the x , y plane are mapped in the β-space, the corresponding computational domain is u , v plan. D u and D v are the selected domain size in the mapped space [4]. The proposed method based on the coordinate transformation, which can fit the hetero interface of QW shown in Fig. 2 and simplify the computational domain as well as the resolution of Schrodinger equation in β-space, becomes possible compared to the case when the problem is solved in the original ε-space. It should be noted that the function given by relation (12) makes simpler the modelling of two shapes of quantum wires. In the next part, we use the general theoretical method proposed above to calculate the eigenvalues for the different shapes of quantum wire. In both directions, the discretisation steps are equal, i.e. Δ = h u = h v . Therefore, the total number of grid points that corresponds to the size of the discretization matrix is ( N u v = N u × N v ) . 3 Results and discussion In this part, We depict the numerical study of eigenvalues for InAs/InP quantum wires with different forms. The parameters used in our calculations are presented in Table 1 and taken from Refs. [5,6]. In fact, to characterize and explore our method, we analyze the influence of geometrical parameters of the quantum wire with different shape on the calculated eigenenergies. The analysis is based on the variation of the quantum wire height H. The effect of this parameter on the transition energies is also mentioned in the discussion. First, we have modelled an isolated quantum wire and calculated the ground state energies of electrons and heavy holes as a function of the height H for different models and for a fixed width of 14 nm. According to Fig. 3 we find that, for an isolated QW and all models, the energies decrease with the height H. As can be seen in Fig. 3a) the ground state energies for electron for model 1 is lower compared to model 2. For heavy holes, for H ˂ 3.3 nm, the energies for model 1 is higher than that for model 2, but for H ˃ 3.3 nm, the two models change the trend as illustrated in Fig. 3b). We have deduced the transition e-hh (electron-heavy hole) behaviour with the wire height H. The results are shown in Fig. 3c). The difference between the two models is of 2.22 meV with H = 2.73 nm, 5.07 meV with H = 3.22 nm and 8.28 meV with H = 3.71 nm. To better explain the behaviour of the transition e-hh, we have plotted in Fig. 4 the transitions of energies as a function of the height for one, three and five QWs in the same figure. For model 1 and 2, the energy of 1 QW is a little bit higher compared to 3 QWs but the difference between this energy and that obtained for 5 QWs is more remarkable. This difference remains nearly constant at about 7 meV and 8 meV for model 1 and 2, respectively. From these figures, we can note that the values for the transition energy of the isolated QW are always higher than the other two cases. By virtue of the importance of the energy levels, we have also studied the ground state energies of electrons and heavy holes and the transition energies e-hh as a function of the number of quantum wires and for a fixed height of 4 nm. The results of this study are illustrated in Fig. 5 . As for electrons, it is observed that the energy decreases as the number of QWs increases. This means that the energy is divided with the increase of QWs number. In Fig. 5b), the energy of heavy holes remains constant with the increase of the QWs number. It is maximum and minimum at about 77.42 meV and 75.67 meV for models 1 and 2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5c), for the two models, the transition energies decrease when the number of the wire increases (Fig. 5). 4 Conclusion In the present work, we presented first an efficient method, which consists on a coordinate transformation in order to model a quantum wire with different forms. The proposed method has been used to calculate the electron and hole energy levels of isolated and self-organized quantum wires. Thus, the Schrödinger equation is solved by the FDM in the new computational space. Then, we studied the influence of geometrical parameters on the shape of the quantum wire and we investigated the optical transition energies. According to the obtained results for the ground state energies for electrons and heavy holes as well as the deduce transition energies e-hh, the geometrical parameters, the shape and the number of quantum wires have an important role in the optical properties.

Furthermore, the mathematical model shows an ability to produce a method for calculating the trapped charge and the maximum stopping potential to disappear the ion mirror effect and accurately excellent.",Apr-18," Keywords Ion optics Focusing ion beam device Ion beam current Ion mirror effect Insulator charging 1 Introduction The term ""Electron optics"" or ""Ion optics"" are defined as the branch of physics that deals with matters related to the motion of particles charged by magnetic fields and electric fields, and the generation of images using electron beams or ion beams [1,2]. Today's optical electronic devices have become analytical devices that are indispensable in many technology fields. Although the age is short for scientific development, these devices have undergone great development and mutations in a short period of time [3]. That the first and simplest application of electronic optics is the construction of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The advanced applications of the charged particles are the instrument Focus Ion Beam (FIB) [4,5]. The understanding of the mechanism of accumulation of charges in insulation materials is very important in science and modern technology because it leads to best applications of insulation materials, especially in the fields of electronics and space technology [6,7]. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the instrument Focus Ion Beam (FIB) are among the most important devices used in the accumulation of charges because it provides the possibility of controlling the number of the charge orient towards the insulation and the area in which it is distributed, in addition to controlling the charges conditions different. The Focus Ion Beam instrument (FIB) is one of the most important devices currently used in nanometer scale applications [8,9]. The Focus Ion Beam instrument (FIB) is similar to Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and the fundamental difference to both is the nature of the beam used in scan. In the Focus Ion Beam instrument (FIB) from ions and often Gallium ion Ga + , the beam ion (FIB) can be emitted to a diameter equivalent to the fraction of nanometer. As a result, the accuracy obtained by FIB is better than SEM and the interaction of the Gallium ion Ga + to the target material varies on interaction of electrons with the same material and Table 1 shows a comparison between (FIB) and (SEM) [10]. The electron mirroring effect (EME) occurs in scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been notified since the 1970s [11,12]. In 2008, a similar effect observed in focusing ion beam (FIB) by Croccolo and Riccardi, it is called Ion mirror effect [13]. Since then, great effort has been to make sure the electron mirror effect and ion mirror effect does not occur. Recently, it turns out that the electron mirror effect and ion mirror effect is quite useful and use it as a tool to obtain information about the model dielectric materials properties or use it as an analytical tool in the SEM and FIB systems [14]. 2 Theoretical aspects 2.1 Mirror effect phenomenon mirror effect phenomenon is occurring inside the chamber of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) or inside the chamber of the focus ion beam instrument (FIB) in a non-conductive sample when the irradiated by electrons or ions, an excess charge is spatially trapped within the sample generating distortions in the electrons or ions beam path, leads to image the insider chamber space instead of imaging the sample surface[13]. The imaging ion mirror effect (IME) is the result of a two-step process (see Fig. 1 ). 2.1.0.1 First step The first step is the charging the insulating surface until it acts as an ion mirror of sufficient strength to deflect the ions of the primary beam towards the secondary electron detector (i.e., forming a layer of ions on the sample surface (charge trapping)) (see Fig. 1a). When the focusing ion beam is used as a source energetic ion, the disc charge area is produced. A disc of radius Rs with amount positive charge trapping Qt on the surface sample (see Fig. 2 a). The electric field as a function of the optical axis-z due to a group of point charge dq can be written as [16]: (1) d E Z = 1 2 π ε ° d q y 3 z Eq. (1) can be written as; (2) E Z = ∫ d E = 1 2 π ε ° ∫ d q z 2 + r 2 3 z Where ε ° is the permittivity of free space ( ε ° = 8.85 × 10 - 12 F / M ), dq is a differential element of charge trapping, z is the optical axis-z (i.e., distance between the insulator surface and the ion gun aperture), y = z 2 + r 2 and r is the distance from the center of the disc charge to dq. Since the differential element of charge trapping (dq) is assumed to be uniform, thus (3) ∴ d q = σ d A = 2 π r σ d r Where s is a surface charge density. We substitute Eq. (3) in to Eq. (2) we get (4) ∴ E Z = z 2 π ε ° ∫ 0 R s 2 π r σ z 2 + r 2 3 d r By solving Eq. (4) we get (5) ∴ E Z = z π σ 2 π ε ° [ 1 z - 1 z 2 + R s 2 ] (6) ∴ E Z = Q t 2 π R s 2 ε ° [ 1 - z z 2 + R s 2 ] Where Q t = π R s 2 σ . The electric potential at the sample surface due to the trapping charge can be found by ϕ s Z = - ∫ E d z (7) ∴ ϕ s Z = = Q t 2 π R s 2 ε ° [ z 2 + R s 2 - z ] 2.1.0.2 Second step The second step is the building up of an image of the ion mirror effect as the insulator sample is irradiated with lower energy ions, which are reflected back from the charged sample in the form of an ion beam directed to the chamber walls. The subsequent interaction of ions with the chamber materials generates secondary electrons. Eventually, the some of which are detected by the detector causing the ion mirror effect image (see Fig. 2b). A similarly to the first step, assume that these ions may be distributed uniformly within a disc of radius Rb with a total charge Qb=It. Where it is time providing an injected charge (Qb) within the beam space. Thus, Eq. (7) can be using to finding ions beam potential along the ions beam axis (see Fig. 2b). Eq. (7) can be written as; (8) ϕ b W D - Z = I b t 2 π R b 2 ε ° [ W D - z 2 + R b 2 - W D - z ] Where WD is the working distance. Eq. (8) provides a shortcut to understanding the behavior of the ions beam potential ϕ b W D - Z , which depends on the beam's current and diameter. So the numbers of accelerated ions that construct the ions beam. It is clear that Eq. (7) represents an opposed potential which tries to pause the scanning ions from reaches the sample surface. (i.e., represents a surface potential ( ϕ s Z ) to weaken the incoming ions and hence resist them to progress towards the sample surface). On the other hand, Eq. (8) shows a potential ions beam ( ϕ b W D - Z ) that test to weaken the first one and so push the incoming ions away from the FIB column diaphragm. When the sum of the accelerating scanning (Vsc) and ions beam potentials ( ϕ b W D - Z ) being equal to the sample potential ( ϕ s Z ), the incoming ions stop moves at a specific axial point (z) and hence reflected back towards the chamber inner walls of the focuing ion beam instrument (FIB). Accordingly, an equation to describe the conservation of energy law can be written as follows: (9) ϕ s Z = ϕ b W D - Z + V s c . Substitute Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) in Eq. (9) and rearrange can be obtain (10) Q t R b 2 I b t R s 2 z 2 + R s 2 - z - W D - z 2 + R b 2 - W D - z - 2 π ε ° R b V s c I b t = 0 Can be using Eq. (7) to determine the position for ion reﬂection for speciﬁc experimental parameters (i.e., depends on the trapped charge Q t , working distance W D , and radius of the charged disc R b a n d R s .) 3 Results and discussions This section dedicated to discuss influence of ion beam current parameters on the main incident ion beam. Furthermore, trapped charges determination will be discussed and so some results of certain published literatures will be definition for implementation and comparison purposes. In fact, the all results are obtained for the values of Qt = 508 pC, Rb = Rs = 0.457 mm and work distance = 30 mm. These values are chosen according to conditions of usual operation in focusing ion beam (FIB) experiments with the ion mirror effect phenomenon for Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) sample and according to Ref. [2]. 3.1 Ion beam current characteristics parameters Fig. 3 shows the variation of the ion reflection point versus the ion beam current (Ib) for different values of the scanning potential (Vsc). It is seen that the increasing of the number of ions (ion beam current) in the beam gives increasing of Qb over its counterpart trapped charge (Qt) (i.e. resist the sample potential) although it’s scanning potential (Vsc) is fixed. In other word, this increase the number of ions more and more (beam potential) gives ions the ability to penetrate more and more within the area of influence for the surface potential and hence the ion beam approaching much from the surface. On the other hand, Fig. 1 shows the reflection point decreases when higher scanning potential (Vsc). Strictly speaking, the reflection point of an incident ion becomes closer from the Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) surface pointedly when the scanning potential (Vsc) goes to higher values. It’s clear that can overcome the ion mirror effect phenomenon either through higher scanning potential (Vsc), or through a low scanning potential (Vsc) by using the ion beam current (Ib) parameters. In other words, the ion beam current (Ib) can only be used to adjustment ion mirror effect at low values of the scanning potential (Vsc). So the ion beam current (Ib) can be considered as important parameter to control the ion mirror effect phenomenon. Obviously, Fig. 3 shows that the ions can’t reach to the sample under study when the scanning potential equals to 6 Kv whatever the values of the beam current (ion current). This result is very important to imaging the sample surface without any damage to the sample under study. Fig. 3 also shows that the current (Imax) required for a beam of ions so as to hit a sample surface for different values of scanning potential (Vsc) (see Table 2 ). It is seen that the increases in the values of Vsc, a beam current that allow the ions to hit the sample surface have a low quantity (the ion beam current decreases when the values of scanning potential (Vsc) increased). 3.2 Disappearance mirror effect Figs. 4–8 show Variation of ion beam current versus the quotient Qb / Qt (remembering that Q b = Ibt) for different values of scanning potential (Vsc = 6–10 Kv respectively). Reverting to Figs. 4–8, it is worth to mention that there is a similar behavior between the curves of ion beam current) for different values of scanning potential (Vsc = 6–10 Kv respectively). Consequently, one may readily realize that the increase in beam potential leads to big increase in the values of Qb /Qt for different values of scanning potential. This a result may directly afford in mind that, the increases of the ion beam current give the ion beam additional ability to fight the sample potential. Therefore this ability increase more and more as the ion beam current increases further and further. Thus, chance of the incident ion to reach the sample surface increases with increasing of the ion beam current. So the ion beam current can be deeming as an important parameter to control the images of ion mirror effect. When Qb /Qt become equal to unity. This result led to disappeared mirror effect. For such setup, actually, the incident ion reflects at the midpoint of the working distance, and so ions can never reach the sample surface for this case, as long as the ion beam current supplies a number of ions equal to that trapped at the sample surface. From the Figs. 3–8, it provides an important tool for the theoretical calculation to the ion beam current accurately higher (see Table 2). 4 Conclusions The presented work proved can be used the same procedure mathematically to study ion mirror effect phenomenon in focusing ion beam(FIB) microscope and electron mirror effect phenomenon in scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results show the prospect using the ion beam current to set and controlling the ion mirror effect accurately. In the other hand, the results have clearly shown that the ion beam current an influence similar to that of the scanning potential parameter. But the ion beam current has an important effect on the deduced mirror images in comparison with the other beam parameters. The reason for this that impact the ion beam current can be control of the mirror effect phenomenon for low values of the scanning potential. Furthermore, the “adjust” of mirror images can substantially be made up with the variation of ion beam current rather than the variation of scanning potential. Results show fact, which is that sample PMMA needs a beam current one is (0.12 nA) for all variation of scanning potential to disappear ion mirror effect. As well the maximum stopping potential to disappear the ion mirror effect is (16 Kv) and safe scanning potential is (≤6 Kv). Hence, the procedure mathematically to study ion mirror effect phenomenon in focusing ion beam (FIB) microscope provides an important tool for the calculation of the trapped charges that may accumulate on the PMMA sample surface inside the FIB chamber. Furthermore the reflection coordinates of the head-incident on can be well defined without need to solve the ion equation of motion. Thus, a good interpretation can be extracted for the ion mirror effect images. "," [1] H.N. Al-Obaidi F.A. Al-Saymary A.A. Ali PET mirror image characterization Summ. Scho.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.002,Circular-path polarization point-diffraction interferometer and analysis of the fringe parameters,"Abstract A circular-path polarization point-diffraction interferometer (PDI) is developed, in which the reference and test waves travel in a nearly same optical path and in opposite directions. Furthermore, a linear tilting modulation can be introduced into two interfering waves by rotating the polarization beam splitter (PBS). As a result, the fringe pattern with carrier frequency is captured and the Fourier transform method is employed to extract the tested wavefront. Furthermore, by analyzing the fringe parameters, i.e., fringe contrast and carrier frequency, it can be concluded that the proposed PDI can adjust easily these two fringe parameters. Therefore, the fringe pattern with the highest contrast and suitable carrier frequency can be captured, and so as this PDI with compact configuration can also obtain high accuracy of phase meausrement.",Apr-18," Keywords Point-diffraction interferometer (PDI) Common path interferometer Phase measurement Fringe contrast Carrier frequency 1 Introduction The point-diffraction interferometer (PDI) is a self-referencing interferometer developed in many years. This interferometric method can realize the absolute measurement of wavefront and directly obtain the wavefront information [1,2] without the difficult reconstruction algorithm similar to that using in the shearing interfermoter [3,4]. Also, PDIs has been applied to the adaptive optics or detect the waveftont phase in strong scintillation [5,6]. The PDI’s primary advantages is its common-path design and no requirement of other reference wave to be introduced. An interferogram can be formed with only a single laser path rather than with the two paths required for Mach–Zehnder or Michelson interferometers. This is especially important in the measurement of large objects such as wind tunnel flows, in which the optical paths are very long and air turbulence must be minimized along the paths. A single path is also advantageous when the size of the instrument must be kept small. The common-path design requires relatively few optical elements, thereby reducing the cost, size, and weight of the instrument and simplifying alignment. Like any interferometer, the interferograms produced by the PDI must be interpreted to extract information about the object wave front. The effective way to measure wave-front aberration is to use phase-shifting interferometry [7] or Fourier transform method [8]. The PDI has traditionally been unable to use this advanced technique, however, because its common-path design makes it difficult to shift the phase of one beam relative to the other. Many modifications have been proposed to add phase shifting or introduce phase modulation to the PDI. For example, the Liquid-crystal PDI proposed by Mercer [9–11] embedded a microsphere within the liquid-crystal layer, and employed a liquid-crystal layer to introduce phase shifts. The PDI developed by Kwon [12] used a specially fabricated diffraction grating to produce three phase-shifted interferograms simultaneously. Since Murty [13] proposed the basic form of circular-path or cyclic interferometer, it was studied widely and applied in PDI [14] or radial shearing interferometer [15–17] to implement common path structure. Some new PDI configurations have been developed to apply in lens testing, fluid flow diagnostics, opaque surfaces, and so on. However, some drawbacks are still not overcome, which include poor real-time measurement in phase shifting technique [16,17], poor craft of making the PDI mask in Kwon and Mercer technique [9,12], and the contrast of interferograms is limited for great majority techniques such as the literature [14,15]. In the paper, the combination of a circular-path polarization structure and a polarizer with pinhole as the PDI mask carry out a common-path PDI. After a linear modulation is introduced conveniently, one can use the Fourier transform method to extract real-time the wavefront phase. In addition, this system allows the fringe contrast and spatial frequency to be adjusted easily, and hence the fringe pattern with the highest contrast and suitable carrier frequency can be obtained. Therefore, the circular-path polarization PDI can measure different aberration wavefront with high accuracy of phase measurement. 2 Experimental setup We propose and demonstrate a new PDI with a polarization circular-path configuration. The schematic of its experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . The circular-path optical system is composed of a polarization beam splitter (PBS), two mirrors, M1, M2, and two lenses (i.e., L1 and L2) with the equivalent focal lengths. An expanded and collimated beam linearly polarized incidence into the circular-path system, and then it is split into the transmitted and reflected waves by the PBS, which orthogonal linearly polarized state. Two waves travel in a nearly same optical path and in opposite directions. Namely, the transmitted wave traverses along anticlockwise direction and the reflected wave traverses along clockwise direction, which are represented respectively as solid line and dotted line in Fig. 1. A polarizer P1(90°) placed in the common focal plane of lenses L1 and L2, contains a reference pinhole centered on the foci of the reference wave. The transmission axis of P1 orients along the Y-axis, which is perpendicular to the polarized direction of the transmitted wave but parallel to that of the reflected wave. Therefore, the transmitted wave will be focused by lens L1 on the pinhole and so be filtered with pinhole diffraction. Furthermore, an ideal plane wave is obtained after traveling through the lens L2 and works as a reference wave. As for the reflected wave, it will focus on the outside of the reference pinhole while tilting the PBS slightly, and thus it will pass through P1 wholly with no any attenuation and work as a test wave. The reference and test waves are transmitted and reflected by the PBS again. Finally, the interference pattern is formed by the superposition of two interfering waves in the CCD plane after passing through a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and another polarizer P2(0°) with their transmission axis oriented at 45° and 0° respectively. The spatial filtering with pinhole diffraction will give rise to the attenuation of intensity of reference wave. To improve the contrast of fringe, a half-wave plate (HWP) is inserted in front of PBS. As shown in the next section, while rotating its transmission axis direction of α with the reference Z-axis, the amplitude proportion of two interfering waves will also vary. The He-Ne laser wavelength (λ) is equal to 632.8 nm, and the aperture diameter (D) of input beam is equal to 4.61 mm. The focal lengths (f) of lens L1 and L2 are equals to 250 mm. The diameter of reference pinhole in the P1 is equal to 60 μm, which equals about 60% of the Airy-disk for unaberrated wave, namely 1.46 λ f / D . 3 Mathematical analysis of principle According to the conventional Jones matrix formalism [18], Each wave is represented in a Jones matrix for mathematical interpretation. The incident linearly polarized light expressed as E = exp i φ is divided into two orthogonal waves, i.e., the transmitted wave and reflected wave. They are presented respectively as (1) E a = cos α 1 0 exp i φ and (2) E b = sin α 0 1 exp i φ , where i = − 1 , φ is the wavefront phase to be tested, α is the transmission axis direction of the HWP to the reference Z-axis, which varies from 0 to 90°. The Jones matrix of the P1(90°) with its transmission axis oriented at 90° is given by P 90 ° = 0 0 0 1 . It is assumed that the spatial filtering after pinhole diffraction is perfect, so the transmitted wave will become a reference plane wave which is expressed as (3) E r = κ cos α 1 0 , namely the phase information included in the factor exp i φ in the above expression will be eliminated. By spatial filtering the optical intensity passing through the pinhole will reduced, and the parameter κ in Eq. (3) denotes the intensity transmission rate of the pinhole under a given wavefront aberration φ . The test wave from the reflected wave holds same amplitude and polarization direction with the reflected wave and its Jones matrix is given by (4) E m = 0 0 0 1 ⋅ E b = 0 0 0 1 ⋅ sin α 0 1 exp i φ = sin α 0 1 exp i φ . Jones matrix of QWP(45°) with transmission axis at 45° is expressed as 1 2 1 − i − i 1 . After transmitting the QWP the reference and the test waves become right-circularly and left-circularly polarized light which are expressed respectively as (5) E ′ r = Q W P 45 ° ⋅ E r = 1 2 1 − i − i 1 ⋅ κ cos α 1 0 = κ cos α 2 exp i 0 exp -i π / 2 , (6) E ′ m = Q W P 45 ° ⋅ E m = 1 2 1 − i − i 1 ⋅ sin α 0 1 exp i φ = sin α 2 exp -i π / 2 exp i 0 exp i φ . The result after recombining two waves is expressed as (7) E x E y = E ′ r + E ′ m = 1 2 κ cos α + sin α exp i φ − π / 2 κ cos α exp -i π / 2 + sin α exp i φ . After passing through the polarizer P2(0°) with transmission axis oriented at 0° whose Jones matrix expressed as P 0 ° = 1 0 0 0 , only the component in x direction of the recombined wave will pass. The result is given by (8) E x = κ cos α 2 + sin α 2 exp i φ − π / 2 . The intensity of the Eq. (6) is expressed as (9) I = E x E x * = κ cos 2 α 2 + sin 2 α 2 + κ cos α sin α sin φ . Assume that I r = κ cos 2 α 2 and I m = sin 2 α 2 , Eq. (9) is rewritten as (10) I = I r + I m + 2 I r I m sin φ . When the PBS is rotated slightly around the Z-axis, the linear tilting modulation can be introduced between two interfering waves. In this case, the intensity distribution of the interference pattern is generally written as (11) I = I r + I m + 2 I r I m sin φ + 2 π f 0 x , where f 0 is the introduced spatial carrier frequency. With the Fourier transform method the wavefront phase can be extracted from the Eq. (11). 4 Analysis of fringe contrast The contrast of interference fringe is one of the important factors affecting the accuracy of phase measurement in the interferometer [19]. According to the intensity formula of interference pattern shown as Eq. (11), the contrast formula is given by (12) K = 2 I r I m I r + I m = 2 κ cos α sin α κ cos 2 α + sin 2 α = 2 κ tan α κ + tan 2 α . If we let K in above expression be equal to one, then the relationship between α and κ is described as (13) α = arctan κ . From Eq. (12) we can find that the angle α of the HWP will affect the contrast K , namely, the contrast in this PDI system can be adjusted by rotating the HWP. At the same time, Eq. (13) indicates that in the case of a given intensity transmission κ one can obtain a value of α that makes the contrast of interference fringe reach to the highest value (i.e. one). It is a fact that the intensity transmission ratio of reference wave is influenced by two factors, namely, the size of pinhole making point diffraction and the incident wavefront to be tested. Derivation of reference wave and influence of pinhole size have been analyzed in the literature [20]. Here, we use an atmospheric phase screen consistent with Kolmogorov theory to simulate numerically. The phase screen with D / r 0 = 1 and D / r 0 = 5 consists of 3–25 Zernike modes, where D is the diameter of input aperture and r 0 is the Fried parameter, and a wrapped phase is shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). A pinhole with 60% of the Airy-disk diameter for the unaberrated wave is used to generate the reference wave and moderately improve intensity transmission. The fringe contrast K as a function of the rotation angle α of the HWP is illustrated in Fig. 2(c), and in either case, K is ascensive at first and degressive afterwards along with increase of θ . Therefore, one can obtain an important conclusion that K is variable and can reach a maximum value (K = 1) in varying range of θ . Their difference of two curves in Fig. 2(c) represents that the varying trends are different for each aberration modes. However, the value of θ corresponding to the highest contrast is not identical. In the case of any incident wavefront aberration, through varying α the intensity ratio of two interfering wave can be appropriately adjusted in order to maximize the contrast. 5 Analysis of carrier frequency size The Fourier transform method was originally introduced and demonstrated by Takeda et al [8], and only one frame of fringe is required to extract wavefront phase. So it is the easiest method capable of dealing with dynamic situations. To descript briefly principle of Fourier transform method, generally, the intensity distribution of the carrier frequency interferogram shown as Eq. (11) can be rewritten as (14) g x , y = a x , y + b x , y cos φ x , y + 2 π f 0 x , where a x , y and b x , y are background and modulation intensity. With the definition (15) c x , y = 1 2 b x , y e i φ x , y , Eq. (14) is rewritten as (16) g x , y = a x , y + c x , y e i 2 π f 0 x + c * x , y e -i 2 π f 0 x , where superscript * denotes the complex conjugate. The Fourier transform of Eq. (14) is given by (17) G u , v = A u , v + C u − f 0 , v + C * u + f 0 , v , where the capital letters denote the transforms of the corresponding functions, and u and v are the variables in the frequency domain. Assumed that the quantities a x , y , b x , y and φ x , y are slowly varying functions compared to the carrier frequency f 0 , that is (18) f > ∂ a x , y ∂ x , ∂ b x , y ∂ x , and ∂ φ x , y ∂ x , the terms A, C, and C * will be separable in the frequency domain. Thus the term C may be isolated with a suitable frequency filter. With the inverse Fourier transform of C, c x , y is obtained, and the wrapped phase is calculated from (19) φ w x , y = tan − 1 Im c x , y Re c x , y . Furthermore, one can obtain the unwrapped phase φ x , y with the phase-unwrapping algorithm [21]. Generally, the intensity distribution of reference wave from the PDI no longer is uniform, and the greatest nonuniformity will appear when the pinhole size is equal to the Airy-disk diameter [22]. We use respectively Gaussian function and uniform function I r = 60 e − 2 x 2 + y 2 and I m = 65 to descript the intensities of reference and test waves, and then use the wavefront shown in Fig. 2(b) and the intensity formula shown in Eq. (13) to simulate the interferograms. In the used expression, − 1 ≤ x 2 ≤ 1 and − 1 ≤ y 2 ≤ 1 . In the above given condition, background and modulation intensity of interferogram are also of spatial variation. The simulated interferograms are sampled with a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels, and each pixel is quantized to 256 possible gray levels. A series of interference fringe are created as the frequency f 0 varies. Fig. 3 (a) shows a frame of simulated fringe with f 0 = 25 , and its Fourier transform and corresponding central-section curves are plotted respectively in Fig. 3(b) and (c). With the Fourier transform method the wavefront phases are extracted from the simulated fringe pattern. The difference between extracted and given phases is obtained and defined as residual phase. Also, the root mean square (RMS) values of residual phases are calculated. The behavior of the RMS value versus the carrier frequency size under the given aberration as shown in Fig. 2(b) is plotted in Fig. 4 . It can be concluded from Fig. 4 that the larger error occurs at the carrier frequency of less than 30 and greater than 95, and the RMS values are typically less than 0.08λ within the frequency values ranging from 40 to 75. Although only one aberration phase is analyzed, the simulated result from Fig. 4 still may reflect the affecting law of carrier frequency. Namely, a suitable carrier frequency is great important to the Fourier transform method especially while the wavefront to be tested are unknown, which holds wide-range alterability such as different aberration mode or varying magnitude. In fact, in the case of totally separation of zero-frequency and fundamental frequency compositions the lower carrier frequency size may increase the spatial sampling resolution to the period of one fringe. As a result, the higher accuracy of phase extraction will be obtained. For example, in the above simulation the optimal carrier frequency should be equal to 45. However, the determination of the appropriate carrier frequency depends mainly on the varying speed of a x , y , b x , y and φ x , y . Therefore, an adjustable carrier frequency is very helpful to improve the accuracy of the Fourier transform method used in an interferometer. 6 Experimental results In the experiment, a phase-only liquid crystal (LC) spatial light modulator (SLM) is used to introduce the tested wavefront. This SLM has an array of 256 × 256 pixels across a 4.61 mm square aperture, and the relationship between the phase retardance and the gray levels has been calibrated accurately in our previous work [22]. The collimated plane laser output passes through the SLM and then incidences into the circular- path polarization PDI system. At first, a wavefront phases is introduced by the SLM, and the generated fringe pattern is captured by the CCD camera. Through rotating gradually the HWP a series of fringe pattern with different fringe contrast are captured and the values of contrast are calculated. According to the fitting results of calculated data, the rotation angle of the HWP associated to the highest contrast is determined. Then by rotating the HWP and tilting the PBS, the interferogram with the highest contrast and a suitable carrier frequency is captured, and two frames of fringe patterns under different wavefront are shown in Fig. 5 . For the first tested phase, with the rotation of HWP the calculated contrast values and the fitting result from calculated data are wholly shown in Fig. 6 . From the fitting result we can know that the rotation angle corresponding to the highest contrast equals about 8°. With the Fourier transform method the phases are respectively extracted from the fringe patterns. Also, the residual phase, i.e., the difference of extracted and given phases, is calculated. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) describes the introduced original phase and residual phase corresponding to Fig. 5(a). Another results shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d) correspond to Fig. 5(b). For the residual phase shown in Fig. 7(b), the RMS value and the peak-to-valley (PV) value are equal to 0.05λ and 0.43λ, respectively. For the residual phase shown in Fig. 7(d), the RMS value and the PV value are equal to 0.03λ and 0.44λ, respectively. The maximal errors appear in the area near to the borders of the analyzed interferogram, which is mainly due to the well-known border effect [23] from the Fourier transform method. 7 Conclusion The paper has presented a new circular-path polarization PDI with many advantages such as convenient to set up and use, compact in structure, easy fabrication of PDI mask, and low cost to system. More importantly, the fringe contrast and carrier frequency in this system can be adjusted easily. Therefore, the high measuring accuracy can be obtained for different tested aberration wavefront no matter mode style or magnitude size. This characteristic is of great practicality as a wavefront sensor especially using in the closed-loop adaptive optics. As a result, it is very beneficial to improve the speed of closed loop.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.205,Investigation of near-infrared luminescence in Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors,"Abstract ZnMgAl10O17-phosphor samples doped with Er3+ ions and codoped with both Er3+ and Yb3+ ions were prepared using a combustion method. The formation of combustion products was confirmed by the XRD analysis. Upon the excitation at 980 nm, the IR-emission spectra of ∼1.53 μm were measured for the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17-phosphor samples. The deconvolvement of the emission spectra and the fitting analysis suggest that the Er3+ ions occupied the same sites in both phosphor samples. Further, the wavelength of the sublevel-split components and the effective linewidths were determined. The significant enhancement of the IR-emission intensity and the broadening of the Er3+ ions (4I13/2 → 4I15/2) in the prepared phosphors were explored.",Apr-18," Keywords Combustion Infrared emission Phosphors Energy transfer Er3+Yb3+ 1 Introduction Trivalent erbium (Er3+)-doped materials have attracted great attention due to their potential applications in the design of optical devices such as light converters, sensors, optical-fiber amplifiers, displays, high-density memories, solid-state lasers, waveguide lasers, and infrared (IR) photodetectors [1–5]. Among the various rare-earth ions, the Er3+-doped fiber amplifiers at 1.5 μm have received much attention in terms of the capability regarding long-distance optical transmissions [6–9]. Dedicated efforts have been made to achieve excellent IR luminescence properties with respect to the Er3+-doped varieties of inorganic compounds [10–16]. Although Er3+-doped systems are well known for IR-region emissions, a dearth exists regarding the reports on Er3+-doped aluminate-based phosphors. Singh et al. [17] reported the effect on the IR-luminescence intensity of a codoping with Yb3+ and Mg2+ ions in terms of the CaAl12O19:Er3+ matrix. The IR emissions of the MgSrAl10O17:Er3+ phosphor that had been codoped with Yb3+/Ba2+/Ca2+ ions that were obtained using the solution-combustion route were reported by the same group [18]. The literature survey of the present-study authors revealed a scarcity of papers that deal with Er3+-doped aluminates compared with the other trivalent rare earths and the transition-metal-ion-doped aluminate phosphors, and a recent extensive spectroscopic study of this ion that also presents a particular investigation of the ZnMgAl10O17 host does not exist. It is noticeable that the exact crystal structure of ZnMgAl10O17 has not been discussed in detail. Further, the optical properties of the rare-earth-doped ZnMgAl10O17 have not been reported in detail. In view of these circumstances, and due to the great demand for IR-emitting phosphors, preparations of the phosphors of the Er3+-doped ZnMgAl10O17 and the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 are contained in the present work. Recently, the successful employment of a self-propagating and gas-producing combustion method for the synthesis of the rare-earth-doped varieties of complex oxide phosphors was achieved [17–20]. For the present work, the same synthesis method has been employed for the preparations of the Er3+-doped ZnMgAl10O17 and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors. The enhancement of the IR-luminescence intensity of the Er3+ ions that is due to the sensitizer role of the Yb3+ ions is also discussed. In addition, the formations of the combustion-synthesized products were confirmed using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) technique. 2 Experimental The phosphors were prepared using combustion synthesis. The used precursors are zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn[NO3]2·6H2O), magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg[NO3]2·6H2O), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al[NO3]3·9H2O), erbium(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Er[NO3]3·5H2O), ytterbium nitrate hydrate (Yb[NO3]3·xH2O), and urea (NH2CONH2). The precursors were mixed according to the chemical formulae ZnMgAl10O17:Er0.05 and ZnMgAl10O17:Er0.05,Yb0.06. The metal nitrates acted as oxidizers, while the NH2CONH2 served as the organic fuel for the combustion process. The oxidizer and fuel ratio was calculated based on the oxidizing (O) and fuel (F) valencies of the reactants, keeping the O/F = 1, as reported earlier [21]. The desired amounts of the starting materials were dissolved with a small amount of deionized water in a Pyrex dish with an approximate capacity of 300 ml, and the resultant solution was introduced into a furnace that had been preheated to 550 °C. Within a few minutes, the combustion reaction occurred with the evolution of the gases. The entire combustion process was completed within approximately 5–8 min, at which point the Pyrex dish was immediately removed from the furnace. The resultant fluffy mass was then crushed into a fine powder, and this was followed by an in-air annealing of the combustion-reaction product at 800 °C for 5 h. The resultant fine powder was then further used for the purpose of characterization. The XRPD patterns of the samples were recorded using the Rigaku Miniflex-II diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), with CuKα radiation providing the X-ray source. The XRPD patterns were taken at a scan rate of 5°/min in the 2θ range of 10–80°. The IR-luminescence spectra of both of the combustion-derived materials were measured using an excitation for which the continuous wave laser diode (CWLD) was operated at 980 nm. With the aid of a convergent lens, these emissions were focused onto the 0.18-m Jobin Yvon TRIAX 180 single-grating monochromator (HORIBA, Japan) with a grating of 150 grooves/mm that was coupled with the multichannel InGaAs charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (BaySpec, U.S.A.). All of the measurements were performed at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRPD analysis Fig. 1 shows the XRPD patterns of the ZnMgAl10O17:Er3+ and ZnMgAl10O17:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors. All of the diffraction peaks that were observed for both of the samples are compatible with those of the ref. [22] that was reported earlier, confirming the formation of a cubic ZnMgAl10O17 phase. The diffraction peaks can be indexed as (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440), (620), and (533), as reported in the ref. [22]. Also, the dopants did not participate in the overall crystal formation, with the exception of the replacing/sitting that occurred between a few atoms. For the phosphor crystallite sizes, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the main XRPD peak was used in the application of the well-known Scherrer equation, as follows: D = 0.9λ/βcosθ, where λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray, θ is the corresponding Bragg-diffraction angle, and β is the FWHM of the (311) peak. The calculated crystallite sizes of the phosphors of the ZnMgAl10O17:Er3+ and the ZnMgAl10O17:Er3+/Yb3+ are 24.65 nm and 24.55 nm, respectively. In the literature, the exact crystal structure of ZnMgAl10O17 has not been well investigated. 3.2 IR-emission spectral analysis upon a 980-nm excitation The well-known IR emission of Er3+ ions at 1.5 μm has attracted considerable interest due to the practical use of these ions in the broadband amplification of fiber amplifiers. However, its low-absorption cross-section at nearly 980 nm limits the pumping efficiency, while the emissions of the commercially available laser diodes are in the wavelength region of 0.8–1.5 μm [23]. To enhance the absorption efficiency at 980 nm, Yb3+ ions are used as the sensitizer because the Yb3+ exhibits a large absorption cross-section and a broad absorption band from 850–1080 nm compared with the weak absorption of the Er3+ ions. Moreover, the large overlap between the Yb3+ emissions and the Er3+ absorption bands at 980 nm allows for the following resonant energy transfer (ET) from the Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ ions: 2F5/2(Yb3+) + 4I15/2(Er3+) → 2F7/2(Yb3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+). The population of the Er3+ ions reaches the 4I13/2 level as a result, thereby strengthening the luminescence intensity after the relaxation to the ground state [24]. The energy-level schematic diagram for the Yb3+:Er3+ ions of Fig. 2 shows the possible occurrence of the IR-emission band and the mechanisms that are involved. In the present work, the room-temperature IR-emission spectra of the phosphor samples of the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 that are around 1.53 μm were recorded with the use of an excitation at 980 nm, and this is shown in Fig. 3 . The observed broadband- and intense-emission bands that are evident around 1.53 μm correspond to the Er3+: 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition in both of the phosphor samples. In Fig. 3(a), it is evident that the appearance of two stark split peaks suggests that the Er3+ ions incorporated into the ZnMgAl10O17 phosphor. Whereas the spectra of the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphor, which are shown in Fig. 3(b), show a similar emission line with two stark split peaks that occur at the same wavelength. Therefore, both the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors share the same local ligand-ion symmetry that surrounds the Er3+ ions. In addition, the deconvolved emission spectra that fit the analysis show eight sublevel-split components in the phosphor samples of both the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17, which can be seen in Figs. 4 (a) and 4 (b), respectively, and this strongly affirms that the Er3+ ions occupied the same sites in both of the phosphor samples. The spectral-fitting analysis shows an important feature, where both the short- and long-wavelength peaks are much broader than the central-wavelength peaks that are incompatible with the other reported host matrices [25]. The fitting analysis of the sublevel-splitting component wavelength and the linewidth of each sublevel are given in Table 1 . The only difference between both of the emission spectral analyses is the significant enhancement of the emission intensity, with the addition of the Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ ions in terms of the ZnMgAl10O17 phosphor, thereby indicating that an efficient energy transfer takes place between the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. It is possible to estimate the requisite number of photons for the population of the excited level through a measurement of the pump-power-dependent IR-emission intensities. In the present work, an attempt was made to measure the pump-power-dependent IR-emission intensities upon the excitation at 980 nm for the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors (Fig. 3). Fig. 5 shows a plot of the logarithmic emission intensities as a function of the logarithmic pump power of a laser yielding a straight line with the slope m = 1.00/0.89 regarding the observed 4I13/2  → 4I15/2 emission band. Thus, one near-IR (NIR) laser photon is responsible for the peaking of the IR emission at 1.53 μm. The gain bandwidth for the amplifiers is an important parameter that is characterized by the FWHM, and the corresponding values are 53 nm and 52 nm for the 4I13/2  → 4I15/2 emission band in the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors, respectively. The evaluative precision of the effective linewidth of the observed emission band, however, is more accurate than the FWHM because of the asymmetric emission-line profile. The effective linewidth (Δλeff) was determined as follows [26]: (1) Δ λ e f f = ∫ I λ d λ I m a x where Imax is the emission-peak intensity. The effective linewidths, which were determined from the measured emission spectra, are 73.89 nm and 70.81 nm for the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors, respectively. Table 2 shows the effective linewidths (Δλeff) of the emission transition of Er3+:4I13/2  → 4I15/2 in various phosphor matrices. It is evident that the effective linewidth of the 4I13/2  → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors is higher than those of the other hosts [27,28], and this is due to the higher local field environment of the dopant ion. Thus, the observed intense emission with the broadening line shape of the Er3+:4I13/2  → 4I15/2 transition in the phosphor samples of the Er3+-doped and the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 could be suitable for the optical telecommunication window and wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) applications [18]. 4 Conclusion Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors were successfully prepared via a solution-based combustion-synthesis technique using organic urea fuel. The XRPD data indicate that the influence on the phases from either the doping or the codoping is not evident, while the codoping of the Yb3+ in the ZnMgAl10O17:Er3+ phosphor increased the IR-luminescence intensity. It is clear from the deconvolved Gaussian-fit emission spectra that the Er3+ ions occupied the same sites in both of the phosphor samples. The effective linewidth was determined from the measured emission spectra and then compared with those of the other host matrices. The observed spectral analysis indicates that the intense emission with the broadening line shape of the Er3+:4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition in terms of the Er3+-doped and the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped ZnMgAl10O17 phosphors can be used for amplifiers that operate at levels of around 1.53 μm.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.124,Theoretical studies on electronic structure and optical properties of Bi2WO6,"Abstract Electronic structure, density of states and optical properties of Bi2WO6 are investigated using the plane waves ultrasoft pseudopotential method based on the density functional theory (DFT). The Bi2WO6 was indirect band-gap semiconductors materials, because the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are not at the same point, which of band gap was found to be 2.595 eV by the electronic structure calculation. Analysis of the density of states indicated that the valence band was consisted with Bi-6s and O-2p states, and the conduction band was composed of W-5d and Bi-6p states. In order to understand optical properties of Bi2WO6, the dielectric function, conductivity, refractive index, absorption coefficients, reflectivity and loss function are studied and analyzed, which shown that the static dielectric constant is 2.83, the refractivity index is 1.68. The results can offer a theoretical basis for the research and application in future.",Apr-18," Keywords First-principles Bi2WO6 Electronic structure Optical properties 1 Introduction Bi2WO6, because of the excellent physical and chemical properties, such as ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, catalytic behavior, nonlinear dielectric susceptibility [1–4], has been widely applied in the related fields [5–8]. Recently, many experimental and theoretical methods study the performance of Bi2WO6. Zhai et al. [9] prepared flower-like Bi2WO6 via a simple hydrothermal route using the non-ionic surfactant F127 (EO–PO–EO) as the morphology director and found that Bi2WO6exhibited improved photo-catalytic performances. Phu et al. [10] synthesized Bi2WO6 nanoparticles by fast microwave-assisted method and achieved high photo-catalytic activity under visible-light-irradiation. Ma̧czka et al. [11] used hydrothermal crystallization method for preparing of nanosized Bi2WO6, Raman spectroscopy studies have also revealed that the modes are mainly the incident light and the scattered light polarization perpendicular to the layer intensity is reduced. But, up to date, the report about the band structure, electronic and optical properties of Bi2WO6 by first-principles is still lacking. It is worth pointing out that although there are a lot of experimental methods can be used to study the electronic and optical properties of a material, but the experimental results still exist a lot of uncertainty. Theoretical calculation results can be as a basis for experiments and verification, from the microscopic interpretation of the principle of macroscopic phenomena. The research and application of Bi2WO6 have very important significance. In this paper, using the first principle to carry out theoretical calculation of Bi2WO6, optimization of geometric structure, and the electronic structure and optical properties are calculated according to the optimized structure. The relation between the microscopic electron migration and the macroscopic optical properties of the crystal are analyzed. 2 Computational details In this work, we used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [12] in the Perdew–Burke–Eruzerh [13] to calculate the band structure and optical properties of Bi2WO6, and the theoretical mechanism are discussed. The calculations have been performed by using Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code [14,15]. Using the plane wave pseuodopotential method, the ion potential is replaced and electron wave function is carried out with the plane wave basis set. We use the GGA to correct exchange interaction between the electrons and the correlation potential. In the DFT, the Schrodinger equation of the single electron motion can be expressed as an atomic unit: (1) − ▽ 2 2 − ∑ q Z q r − R q + ∫ ρ r r − r ' d r ' + V ( r ) Ψ i ( r ) = ε i Ψ i ( r ) (2) ρ r = ∑ i n i Ψ i r 2 where Zq is the nuclear charge, r is the position vector of the nuclear motion, Rq is the distance between two cores, ρ(r) indicates the electron density, V(r) indicates the external potential field, Ψi (r) is single electron wave function, εi is the energy of a single electron, ni indicates the number of electrons occupied by the intrinsic state. The first term is effective electron kinetic energy in the system of Eq. (1). The second represents the attractive Coulomb potential of the atoms in the system, which is expressed by the norm—conserving pseudopotential. The term is electron Coulomb potential. The fourth represents the exchange correlation energy, the concrete form is expressed by the LDA or the GGA. The electron wave function is expanded in the form of plane wave, the cut-off energy is 380 eV, and the integral point in the inverted space is divided by Monkhorst–Pack k-points 5 × 7× 4 [16]. The ions–electrons interaction was modeled by Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseuodopotential [17]. The valence electrons configuration for the O, Bi, and W is 2s22p4, 6s26p3, and 5d46s2, respectively. In order to make stable configurations of the models, all the structures were geometrically optimized using BFGS [18]. The models were converged by setting the value of displacement equal to 5 × 10−5 nm and the total energy difference become equal to 5 × 10−6 eV/atom. To describe the electronic structures accurately, we used the DFT + U d + U p method. Ma et al. [19] suggested that the U p, O value of 7 eV is suitable for oxide materials in first principles calculations. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural properties In order to ensure the accuracy of the parameters used in the calculation, the structure of Bi2WO6 is optimized to obtain the lattice constant of the ground state, the lattice parameters as follows: a = b = 8.530 Å, c = 8.475 Å. It shows that our calculation model and parameters are reasonable, which have only a 1% underestimation of the equilibrium volume compared with the experimental value [20]. But the length is a little longer, and the angle of the lattice vector is smaller than the experimental values, respectively. It means that there is a more serious inner structural distortion in geometry optimization of our computation. Based on the optimized Bi2WO6 containing 36 atoms is constructed for further calculations. The Bi2WO6 is composed of layers structure of alternating (Bi2O2)2+ and WO4 2− layers, which of O and W form octahedron [WO6] of the common edge from Fig.1 3.2 Electronic properties The computed band structure of Bi2WO6 (seen Fig. 2 ) is consistent with the experimental results [21,22]. It can be seen from the comparison that the theoretical calculation and the experimental value can match well, indicating that the character of band structure and the trend of energy gap are reasonable and reliable. The valence band top and conduction band bottom are Y and B, respectively, so it can be inferred that Bi2WO6 is indirect band-gap semiconductors. In order to further explore the modifications in the band structure and the optical properties, the total and partial densities of states (TDOS and PDOS) of Bi2WO6 are calculated. For Bi2WO6, total density of states is mainly composed of four parts (W-5d, W-6s, O-2s and O-2p), combining with the total (a) and partial densities of states (seen Fig. 3 ), the top of valence band is mainly composed of O-2p and a small amount of Bi-s electronic component, the bottom of the conduction band is mainly composed of Bi-s and a small amount of O-2p orbital electron, O-2s is an inner electron, which has a strong locality, and it has no obvious interaction with other internal energy levels. Shown in Fig. 3(a–d), the valence band of Bi2WO6 is composed of O-2p, Bi-6s, Bi-6p, and W-5d, whose conduction band is composed of W-5d, Bi-6p and a small amount of O-2p. This reveals that the hybridized energy level of O-2p and Bi-6s in the valence band is likely to result in the response of Bi2WO6 to visible light in the W-5d energy level of the conduction band. In addition, O-2p and Bi-6s hybrid also make valence band more discrete, which will be beneficial to the migration of the photomous hole in the valence band, so that it has a good photocatalytic efficiency, which is consistent with the research results of Fu et al. [23]. 3.3 Optical properties The dielectric function dominates the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the medium and the interaction between electromagnetic waves and electrons. It connects the electronic structure of the solid to the physical process of the transition, and other optical spectrum such as absorption spectrum, refractive index, reflectance spectrum and conductivity can be obtained through it. Dielectric function imaginary part ε 2(ω) mainly shows that electrons transition from occupied state to unoccupied state, calculated the energy state structure of Bi2WO6, according to the definition of transition probability can be directly deduced dielectric function imaginary part ε 2(ω). In linear response range, solid macro optical response function can usually be made light of the complex dielectric constant ε(ω) = ε 1(ω) + ε 2(ω) or complex refractive index N(ω) = n(ω) + ik(ω) to describe：ε 1 = n 2 − k 2 and ε 2 = 2nk, where n is the refractive index, k is extinction coefficient. According to the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation [24] and direct transition probability, the imaginary part and the real part, absorption coefficient and reflection coefficient of the crystal dielectric function can be deduced, and the results are as follows: (3) ε 1 = 1 + 8 π 2 e 2 m 2 ∑ v , c ∫ B Z d 3 k 2 2 π e ⋅ M c v ( K ) 2 E c ( K ) − E v ( K ) ℏ 3 E c ( K ) − E v ( K ) 2 − ℏ 2 ω 2 (4) ε 2 = 4 π 2 m 2 ω 2 ∑ v , c ∫ B Z d 3 k 2 2 π e ⋅ M c v ( K ) 2 δ E c ( K ) − E v ( K ) − ℏ ω (5) σ = ε 0 ω ε 2 - i ε 0 ω ( ε 1 − 1 ) = σ 1 − i σ 2 (6) L ( ω ) = ε 2 ( ω ) ε 1 2 ( ω ) + ε 2 2 ( ω ) (7) I ( ω ) = 2 [ ε 1 2 ( ω ) + ε 2 2 ( ω ) − ε 1 ( ω ) ] 1 2 (8) R ( ω ) = ε 1 ( ω ) + j ε 2 ( ω ) − 1 ε 1 ( ω ) + j ε 2 ( ω ) + 1 2 (9) n ( ω ) = ε 1 2 ( ω ) + ε 2 2 ( ω ) + ε 1 ( ω ) 2 k ( ω ) = ε 1 2 ( ω ) + ε 2 2 ( ω ) − ε 1 ( ω ) 2 Where c, v represents the CB and VB respectively, BZ is the first Brillouin zone, K is the reciprocal lattice vector, ћ for the Planck constant. e ⋅ M c v ( K ) 2 for the momentum transition matrix element, ω as the angular frequency, the Ec (K) and Ev (K) are the intrinsic level of the conduction band and valence band, respectively. These relations reveal the luminescence mechanism of electronic transitions, which is the theoretical basis of the analysis of electronic structure and optical properties. In addition, other optical properties can be derived from the real ε 1(ω) and imaginary ε 2(ω). Such as energy-loss spectrum L(ω), absorption coefficient I(ω), optical reflectivity R(ω) and refractive index n(ω) can be shown in Eqs. (4)–(9). Fig. 4 shows the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, which can be obtained by Eqs. (3) and (4). It can be seen, when the photon energy is 0, the static dielectric constant of Bi2WO6 is 2.83. As the energy of the photon increases, the real part of the dielectric function rises rapidly, reaching the maximum (5.14) at about 3.80 eV. Comparison of the band structure and density of states for Bi2WO6, there are three main band regions, the largest band appears near the Fermi surface, the band width is narrow, mainly composed of O-2p and Bi-6s orbitals, and the density is high, and the density is high, the transition between them will form the strongest absorption peak of ε 2 curve. The second band appears which are composed of O-2s and W-5d orbitals, formed ε 2 absorption two weak peaks at the 13.39 and 42.92 eV. The optical properties of the materials commonly used to describe the photoconductivity, photoconductivity and dielectric function, the Eqs. (3)–(5) can be seen, there is a consistent one-to-one match between the real part of photoconductivity and the imaginary part of the dielectric function. It is directly related to the electronic structure, characterization of the electrons transitions between the occupied and unoccupied state. Fig. 5 is the result of Bi2WO6 photoconductive, the calculated σ 1 have 4 peaks, with the photon energy, increased from 0 eV, σ 1 began to increase and the formation of two strong peaks at 4.86 eV and 42.80 eV, then σ 1 rapidly decreased to a minimum in the 11.81 eV. Then with the increase of photon energy, σ 1 began to increase and the formation of two weak peak in 13.51 and 20.08 eV. In region of 14.94–17.37 eV, 22.31 and 38.43 eV, and more than 48.62 eV, the real part of the photoconductivity is almost zero, that almost no Bi2WO6 on high frequency electromagnetic wave absorption (Fig. 5). Electronic energy loss is made after the outer electronic material absorption transition to higher orbit absorption, so in addition to variety identification materials, but also can analyze the material gap, bond strength and type, can be said to be a good analytical method, namely electron spectroscopy loss. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that there are four obvious peaks. The peaks are at 9.56, 13.60, 20.18 and 43.23 eV. The energy loss is near 11.2 eV, and the high energy region has a minimal loss. The peak of energy loss near 10 eV, which indicates that the loss energy range is very narrow, and it is very beneficial for the crystal to reduce energy loss and improve the crystal optical storage efficiency. Reflection spectrum is the reflection of electromagnetic radiation ability, varies with the reflection of electromagnetic wave wavelength characteristics, depending on the nature of the material, or the same properties of materials in the composition, surface structure, and the reflection spectral characteristics are also different, constitutes the difference of reflectance spectral curve. Bi2WO6 reflection spectrum of the calculation results as shown in Fig. 7 , starting from 0 eV, reflection coefficient increased with the increase of electron energy, in 5 eV and 10 eV form two strong absorption peak, then the reflection coefficient sharply reduced to zero. It then began to increase and formed three reflecting peaks at 142,142.5 eV. To emphasize the point that, for the semiconductor materials, when the incident light to the role of material surface, will have strong absorption of incident light intensity of the phenomenon, the reflection spectrum is a very strong absorption peak, and the reflection coefficient is zero (Fig. 7). The absorption coefficient of the material indicates the percentage of light intensity attenuation of the light wave in the medium. The absorption spectra of Bi2WO6 are shown in Fig. 8 . From 0 eV, the absorption coefficient increases with the increase of electron energy, and the two strongest absorption peaks are formed at 5.48 and 7.43 eV positions, and then decreases, and almost decreases to zero when the electron energy is 11.2 eV. Subsequently, the absorption peak was formed at 13.51, 20.09 and 42.97 eV. The absorption peak of 42.97 eV is formed by the transition between W-6p and Fermi. The two absorption peaks (13.51, 20.09) in the middle are the formation of O-2s → O-2p and Bi-6s → Bi-6p transitions, respectively. The corresponding relation between absorption coefficient and optical conductivity: a = σ 1 / ε 0 c n It can be seen that the real part of the optical conductivity is proportional to the absorption coefficient, so their characteristic peak position is almost one-to-one. As we know, the refractive index and extinction coefficient are proportional to the real part and the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, respectively. The refractive index n(ω) and extinction coefficient k(ω) as shown in Fig. 9 . By comparison, n(ω) spectral characteristics and the real part ε 1(ω) of dielectric function (Fig. 4) are very similar, this means that the static dielectric constant ε 1(0) corresponding to the static refraction index n(0), it is found that the static refractive index, n(0) is 1.68, with the increase of the energy becomes smaller, and then began to increase in the position until the formation of a peak, and then sharply decreased, the maximum of that is about 2.33 at 4.01 eV and the minimum of that is about 0.34 at 9.14 eV in the 0–10 eV region. The extinction coefficient increases from 0eV to 7.5 eV, the first high peak, and then decreased with the increase of energy until 10 eV began to increase, and the three peaks are formed in 12.5 eV, 20 and 32.5 eV. 4 Conclusions In summary, using CASTEP to optimize the structure of Bi2WO6, the results of optimization are very close to the experimental results, thus the theoretical calculation results are accuracy, the model and calculation method are reasonable and reliable. Firstly, the electronic structure and optical properties of Bi2WO6 are calculated and analyzed on the basis of optimized structure. Through the analysis of band structure and density of states, Bi2WO6 is indirect band-gap materials (Eg  = 2.595 eV), the valence and conduction band mainly contributed by O-2p and Bi-6s states, the formation of covalent bonds. What’s more, by calculating the dielectric function, the energy loss function, the reflection spectrum and the absorption spectrum, we obtained the static dielectric constants is 2.83, the refractivity index is 1.68, which of the peaks are obviously and related to the transition of the electron. The calculation results of optical properties show that the Bi2WO6 has obvious anisotropy, and the visible light has good transmittance, so it can offer a theoretical basis for the research and catalytic application of Bi2WO6 in future.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.164,Rare earth (Ce3+) activated NaMgF3 phosphor synthesised by hydrothermal method and its optical properties,"Abstract In this paper, we present an environment friendly hydrothermal process to synthesize nano/sub micro particles of the rare earth activated complex fluoride NaMgF3 at 180 °C. The tittle compound synthesis was carried out at elevated pressure and temperature in an aqueous medium. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded to check the phase purity of the synthesised compound. Synthesized compounds were micro and nanocrystalline with orthorhombic perovskite crystal structure, space group Pcmn. In order to identify the functional groups Fourier Transform Infrared spectral analysis have been performed. The size and shape of the synthesised compounds were studied by using Field Emission - Scanning Electron Microscope images. Chemical composition of the synthesised compounds were checked by the energy - dispersive X-ray spectra. The absorption bands around 220 and 270 nm were observed which is corresponding to the electronic transition between 4f and 5d configuration of Ce3+. Photoluminescence emission related to the 5 d → 4 f transitions in Ce3+ was observed at 324 nm. Thermoluminescence properties were studied for the X-ray irradiated samples. The glow curve kinetic parameters of activation energy (E) and frequency factor (S) were calculated using standard methods.",Apr-18," Keywords A. optical properties B. hydrothermal C. luminescence D. thermoluminescence 1 Introduction Rare earths doped mixed fluoride compounds have been investigated thoroughly in the past due to the potential of optical applications in several areas including luminescence, optoelectronics, lighting, radiation detection systems and medical applications [1–5]. Moreover, fluorides based compounds are found to have very low phonon energy states [6,7], and rare earth doped fluoride based phosphors have been found to be ideal hosts for getting down-conversion emission [8]. Generally these kinds of inorganic fluorides are synthesised by solid state reaction technique. When compounds are synthesised by using conventional solid-state method at elevated temperature in air atmosphere, normally unnecessary impurities such as O H - , O 2 - get incorporated [9]. These impurities can be quite unfavorable for the optical applications of the materials. Particularly, fluorides compounds are greatly susceptible to the O 2 - content. In order to overcome this problem, fluoride phosphor compounds are synthesised via hydrothermal method which involves a simple experimental setup and is a suitable method in preparing different inorganic materials with controllable morphologies [10]. The hydrothermal synthesis process has risen to become one of the most popular techniques for compound preparation in the past decade and it is a simple solution based and cost effective method where the kinetics of the chemical reaction can be accelerated tremendously [11]. Tremendous attraction in Ce3+ activated compounds for applications of radiation detectors and the tunable lasers in UV–vis ranges [12]. Ce3+ doped materials have attracted owing to their favorable spectral properties and the fact that Ce3+ can be incorporated into various host compounds [13]. Recently, Ce3+ ion doped fluorides such as LiCaAlF6 [14] and LiLuF4 [15] have been recognized to be suitable media for ultraviolet (UV) solid-state laser applications. Herein, in this paper, we report complex metal fluorides NaMgF3 doped with Ce3+ rare earth ions synthesized by hydrothermal method and their spectral properties were investigated. In this method the chemical reaction is occur at the interfaces of different stages, which associates the ethylene glycol based synthesis methods. Due to 4f → 5d transition and fast decay time Ce3+ ion has a broad emission spectrum at the visible region. NaMgF3 belongs to a category of fluoroperovskite crystal structure. The lattice parameters (a = 5.363 Å; b = 5.503 Å; c = 7.676 Å) [16]. Number of functional materials of complex halides exhibits perovskite like structure. Perovskite type crystal structures compounds have received full attention due to their wide variety of attractive physical properties such as optical, electrical, magnetic and so on [17–20]. Generally, mixed fluorides are categorized by wide band gap, having high thermal and mechanical properties with less hygroscopic nature. Recently these compounds paid full consideration in view of their potential application as radiation dosimeters, when added with appropriate dopants [21–23].The fluoroperovskite having the general chemical formula of ABF3, where A, B an alkali and alkaline earth metal respectively and F stands for halide ion. 2 Experimental The stoichiometric composition of starting materials were taken in equal molar ratio of Sodium Fluoride (NaF) and Magnesium Fluoride (MgF2). The calculated amounts of salts were dissolved in ethylene glycol and stirred well using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature. The colloidal solution was then transferred in to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 250 ml capacity. Since the starting materials are fluorides, the container must be having the ability of sustaining highly corrosive nature solution at elevated temperature and pressure for a long duration. Then up to 80% of the total volume of the container was filled with ethylene glycol. Then the Teflon beaker was tightly sealed into a stainless steel container and hydrothermally treated at 180 °C under an autogenous pressure. After complete the hydrothermal process, the furnace slowly cool down to the room temperature. The final ultra-fine powder products were washed with deionized water and filtered many times by using Wattman filter papers, in order to remove unwanted impurities which is formed during reaction. Subsequently the prepared samples were dried in air at room temperature. To understand the synthesis reaction procedure has been formulated as simple flowchart and shown in Fig. 1 . Bruker spectrophotometer has been used to record the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) in the range of 4000–500 cm–1 wave number, and the standard KBr pellet method was used. FE-SEM images of the samples were recorded using a Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM - SUPRA 55) - CARL ZEISS, German. Elemental compositions of the synthesised compounds were analyzed by FESEM with EDAX experimental method. Photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra were recorded using Spectro - fluorometer (Fluorolog version-3; Model FL3-11) which uses Xenon arc lamp (450 W) as excitation source. Thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve was recorded using a HARSHAW 4500 manual TLD Reader from an X-ray irradiated sample at room temperature. The TLD reader is connected with a Personal Computer, where the TL glow peak was measured and analyzed by using the WinREMS software. Samples were heated with the linear heating rate of 5 K/s using a planchetat. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase confirmation The powder XRD spectrum of the pure and Ce3+ doped NaMgF3 powder was recorded in the 2θ range 20 – 70° and shown in Fig. 2 a & b. The indexed peaks are compared with standard JCPDS card (No. 130-303) and it is found in good agreement. This powder XRD results confirms that the prepared sample is in a pure orthorhombic crystal structure with space group Pcmn (62). The * marks indicates the un-indexed peaks which may be due to impurities in the product. Using the Scherrer Eq. (1) mean crystallite sizes of synthesised compounds were roughly calculated [24]. (1) D = k × λ β cos θ Where λ – wavelength of incident X-Ray, D – average grain size of the crystallites, θ – Bragg diffraction angle and k – constant (0.94). The size of the crystallite was estimated from Eq. (1) and found to be around 70 nm for the as prepared compound. 3.2 FTIR spectral analysis The compound formation of NaMgF3 and bonding interaction are well identified from FT-IR analysis. FT-IR spectra of the Ce3+ doped NaMgF3 compound shown in Fig. 3 . Generally it is known that the oxygen content in mixed fluorides prepared by hydrothermal method is less than that of the same compound synthesised by high temperature conventional method [25,26]. The broad peak for OH stretching vibration mode occurs at the region between 3100 cm−1 to 3600 cm−1. This band originates from the adsorbed water molecules. The bands corresponding to the vibrations of water and ethylene glycol are dominant and the absorption band related to the organic solvent could be observed. It is probably related with weak interactions between the organic solvent and fluoride nanocrystals, and it can be easily detached in the purification process. The peaks at 2917 cm−1 and 2851 cm−1 are assigned to the CH and CH2 respectively. The peak at 1635 cm−1 is assigned to the NH3+ asymmetric bending. The CC in plane and out plane bending occurs at 1125 cm−1. 3.3 Morphological analysis The shape of the morphology and size of the synthesised NaMgF3 samples are analysed by using FE-SEM images. Due to the small amount of (0.2 mol %) dopant ions Ce3+ in the NaMgF3 host lattice does not change the crystal structure, shape and size of the products. So we have studied only the nominally pure NaMgF3 as a reference to describe the morphologies and their probable formation mechanism of the products. The starting level of reactants tiny crystalline nuclei are generated from a homogenous supersaturated bulk solution. According to Gibbs-Thompson equation, the crystal growth process then follows, and bigger particles grow at the expense of small crystals. The pure phase can be synthesised under mild preparation condition, with in the solution the reactant can liberally move and make interaction with each other directionally and completely. Fig. 4 a & b illustrates the FE-SEM micrographs of the as synthesised pure NaMgF3 and Ce3+ doped phosphorus at 180 °C for 24 h. From the FE-SEM pictures we can clearly see that the synthesised compounds are cubic good morphology with well shape, indicate that the synthesised samples are single phase. In the case of high magnification image one can observe that the individual cube surface is not smooth, which contains several small cracks. But also the samples synthesised under this experimental condition are not uniform. The particle size of the compounds varying in the range from 100 to 150 nm. Fig. 5 shows the EDX recorded spectrum for the Ce3+ doped NaMgF3 phosphorus. The spectra consist of three major peaks at which were assigned to F, Na and Mg. 3.4 Optical absorption Diffuse reflection spectra of synthesised compounds were measured at ambient temperature using Perkin Elmer model no L950 UV/vis/NIR Spectrophotometer attached to an integrating sphere wavelength range 200–1100 nm. The optical absorption spectra of Ce3+ doped NaMgF3 is shown in Fig. 6 . Background also have presented in this spectra which increase moderately with decreasing wavelengths. Ce3+ doped samples show peaks at 220 and 270 nm. The electronic transition between 4f and 5d configuration of Ce3+ give rise to absorption around 240–330 nm. 3.5 Photoluminescence studies PL excitation spectrum of Ce3+ doped NaMgF3 phosphor (λem = 324 nm) is shown in Fig. 7 . A broad excitation band from 230 to 275 nm with peak maximum of 280 nm owing to the transitions from 4f ground level to 5d excited level of Ce3+ ions. With 280 nm excitation, a sharp peak at 324 nm and two broad emission bands from 330 to 420 nm were observed and shown in Fig. 8 . These two broad bands at a maximum of 350 and 400 nm were attributed to the transition from 5d level to 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 levels of Ce3+. This broad emission band exists due to strong electron – phonon interaction in the 5d excited level. Similar observations reported by several researchers that Ce3+ ions activated phosphors have broad band UV emission in the near UV or blue region due to its 4f → 5d parity allowed electric dipole transitions [27,28]. The possible charge compensation mechanism which occurs may be that when a trivalent Ce3+ ion doped on divalent alkaline earth halides, originating F - interstitials, this produces centers with various lattice symmetries and asymmetries around the Ce3+ ion. Generally Ce3+ ion with nearby charge compensators generate the emission band at higher wavelength [29]. The energy difference of these two broad band peaks are 2000 cm−1 and 2072 cm−1, respectively and these differences of two bands are consistent with the theoretical value [30]. Fig. 9 presents the schematic energy level diagram of Ce3+ ions. The similar emissions at around 324 nm and followed by broad band have been reported in several fluorides doped with Ce3+ due to the transitions from the ground state to the 5d energy levels [31–33]. 3.6 Thermoluminescence studies TL measurements have been used as tool for the analysis of trap parameters in luminescence material. Generally TL phosphors reveal one or several complex glow peaks when the electrons are freed from traps. This glow peak represents the various trap levels present in the band gap of the compound. This trap levels are analyzed by TL parameters such as activation energy (E) and frequency factor (S). Fig. 10 shows the TL glow curve of the synthesis NaMgF3 compound measured for X-ray irradiated sample. The X-ray irradiation of the sample is exposed to prior to TL measurement produces electron-hole pairs. In order to fit the experimental data better, the deconvolution has been carried out using general order kinetics equation as formulated by Kitis et al. [34]. (2) I T = I m b b b - 1 e E k T T - T m T m 1 - b 1 - Δ T 2 T m 2 × e E k T T - T m T m + Z m - b b - 1 Where Δ m = 2 k T m E , Δ = 2 k T E a n d Z m = 1 + b - 1 Δ m . E – activation energy, Tm – maximum temperature, T – absolute temperature, Im – maximum intensity, k – Boltzmann constant, and b – order of kinetic. The fitting was monitored by the figure of merit. (3) F O M = ∑ P T L e x p - T L f i t ∑ P T L f i t The recorded TL glow curve can be fitted by five individual peaks system and the relevant kinetic parameters are presented in Table 1 . Initial rise method: Initial rise is another simplest method, first suggested by Garlick and Gibson in 1948 to determination the trap depth of the TL materials [35] and it can be applied to all kind of kinetic order. This method is based on the assumptions that the number of trapped charge carriers in the ascending part of the TL glow curve (T << Tm) remains constant. The trapped charge carriers are temperature independent. The intensity of the TL glow peak is directly proportional to e x p ( - E k T ) . (4) I T L = C e x p ( - E k T ) where C is the constant. Activation energy (E) can be obtained by using an Arrhenius plot between I n I ( T L ) versus 1/kT shown in Fig. 11 . The calculated values are listed in Table 1. 4 Summary In summary, sub-microsized and nanosized NaMgF3 compound has been successfully prepared via a simple hydrothermal method using ethylene glycol at 180 °C. The synthesised compound is stable in air. PXRD pattern confirms that the synthesised compound is single phase and in well agreement with standard JCPDS file (No. 130-303). Presence of functional groups is identified by FTIR. The absorption spectra of Ce3+ doped NaMgF3 phosphors reveals bands at the 220 and 270 nm which are related to transition between 4f and 5d electronic configuration of Ce3+. The Ce3+ doped NaMgF3 was excited at 280 nm and emission was monitored at 324 nm (4f → 5d transitions) which have broad applications in the field of optical materials. TL properties of the synthesised phosphors have been studied by means of calculating kinetic parameters. This hydrothermal synthesis method for mixed fluorides seems beneficial in terms of low temperature synthesis, high crystallinity and purity. The synthesis procedure is simple, less time consuming, less labor intensive and does not need any catalyst, seed or expensive surfactant, no harmful. This technique can be extended for the preparation for large number of industrially important fluoride compounds.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.145,Thermal images based Hardware Trojan detection through differential temperature matrix,"Abstract Insertions of Hardware Trojan result in unexpected harm to integrated circuits, and will change the characteristics of integrated circuits, such as thermal characteristics. In this paper, we proposed a Hardware Trojan detection method based on differential temperature matrix analysis. The matrix includes 750 differential thermal images data which were obtained from two differences between the testing chips and the golden chip, and the matrix shows each pixel’s differential temperature value from thermal image and provides a novel insight to investigate the impact of Trojan. During experiment procedure, many programmable heating modules were distributed in chips to interfere with Trojan detection. Experimental results show that Trojan insertion could increase the differential temperature, and expand the density distribution of differential temperature at the same time. The proposed method can achieve effective and accurate detection result, Trojan with only a logical gate size has been detected and located in two proportions of logic units occupied between Trojan and programmable heating modules, the proportions are 0.45% and 0.29%, respectively.",Apr-18," Keywords Thermal images Hardware Trojan Detection Differential temperature matrix 1 Instruction With the rapid development of the semiconductor design and fabrication technology, integrated circuits (ICs) have become widely used in military and civil applications. However, malicious modiﬁcation of hardware during design or fabrication has emerged as a major security concern, such malicious circuit modification (referred to as Hardware Trojan) can affect the functions of IC, potentially with disastrous influences in safety-critical applications [1]. Therefore, devising effective methods for Hardware Trojan (HT) detection has become essential. There are many ways of dealing with the risk of HTs. These ways normally include three categories: prevention, detection and localization. Prevention aims to never even permit HTs insertion. Detection is determines whether a hardware system contains a HT. Location is the regional detection of a HT, and the premise is at least one HT has been detected. Since 2007, when the first side channel HT detection paper published [2], researchers have devoted much attention to devising HT detection methods in recent years. Up to now, methods of HT detection can be divided in three major categories: reverse engineering, logic tests and side-channel analysis [3]. Reverse engineering based specification comparison detection [4] is to remove IC chips’ packages, split inner layers, take photos of layouts and wirings, and then compare images with original specifications. Reverse engineering is effective for any kind of HTs detection, but it isn’t suitable for large numbers of ICs testing: Splitting inner layers and taking photos of layouts and wires can cost much time and money, and the chips under test can’t be used any more. Logic testing is the attempt to activate Trojans by applying test vectors and comparing the responses with the legitimate results. However logic testing has a great disadvantage: it is impractical to enumerate all states of a circuit with the numerous logic states and HTs are always activated under rare conditions [5]. As an effective method for HTs detection, side channel analysis was used to detect HTs through examining the abnormal signals from IC’s physical parameters, such as delay [6], voltage [7], current [8], power [9], thermal [10–11] and electromagnetic emanation [12]. Thermal is a sensitive parameter and widely used for characterizing the performance of circuits. In 2014, Nowroz utilized thermal and power maps in HTs detection for the first time [10]. In this paper, we propose a novel HTs detection approach based on the differential temperature (DT) matrix which were obtained from two differences between the testing chips’ and the golden chips’ thermal images. The DT matrix shows each pixel’s DT value on the thermal image varies with time. The accumulations of abnormal thermal signals caused by HTs in time enable the HTs can be easily detected and feature higher detection accuracy. 2 Theory of thermal images differential based hardware Trojan detection Hardware Trojans are malicious alterations or insertions of extra circuitry to integrated circuits for malicious using, such as obstruct a system or intercept its confidentiality. When an IC starts working, the operation temperature in IC will rise up and stabilized in a few minutes. HT’s insertion will bring extra thermal causing the temperature rising quicker than the IC without HT insertion. Fig. 1 shows thermal images on the same kinds of chips with or without a HT in the same moment t 0 , and as Fig. 1(b) shows, a HT has inserted in point P. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the temperature of point P (TP ) can be express as: (1) T P = T 0 + T Δ t 0 + e t 0 T0 is the initial temperature on the chip, T Δ t 0 is the temperature accumulation in the process of the circuits operation, e t 0 is the noises of process and measurement in moment t 0 . Similarly, the temperature of point P ( T P ' ) in Fig. 1(b) can be express as: (2) T P ' = T 0 ' + T Δ t 0 ' + e t 0 ' + T T r o j a n In order to highlight the temperature caused by HT, two differences method has been used in this paper. Two differences include two parts: self-difference and mutual-difference. Self-difference is all the thermal image data from chip will be subtracted by the initial mean value (T0_avr ) which from the same chip’s first thermal image, the purpose is to eliminate the impact of the different initial temperature between T 0 and T 0 ' . As shown in Formulas (3) and (4), T P _ t m p and T P _ t m p ' are temporary variables. (3) T P _ t m p = T P − T 0 _ a v r = Δ T 0 + T Δ t 0 + e t 0 (4) T P _ t m p ' = T P ' − T 0 _ a v r ' = Δ T 0 ' + T Δ t 0 ' + e t 0 ' + T T r o j a n Mutual-difference is the comparison between chips with HT and chips without HT, as shown Formula (5). This procedure can highlight the influence of HTs and obtain the DT matrix. (5) T P _ t m p ' − T P _ t m p = ( Δ T 0 ' − Δ T 0 ) + ( T Δ t 0 ' − T Δ t 0 ) + ( e t 0 ' − e t 0 ) + T T r o j a n As the testing chips with same circuits, and testing under the same condition, so Δ T 0 ' and Δ T 0 can be considered equal approximately, and the same as T Δ t 0 ' and T Δ t 0 . So the temperature caused by HT can be express as: (6) T T r o j a n = ( T P _ t m p ' − T P _ t m p ) − ( e t 0 ' − e t 0 ) As the e t 0 and e t 0 ' are white noises, so the temperature data caused by HT T T r o j a n can be obtained after filtering from temperature data ( T P _ t m p ' − T P _ t m p ) . 3 Thermal images based hardware Trojan detection methodology As shown in Fig. 2 , the proposed HTs detection method in this paper includes three parts: thermal images acquisition, thermal images data processing and results analysis. 3.1 Thermal images acquisition The FLIR A645 thermal infrared imager is used for thermal images acquisition. The resolution of FLIR A645 is 640*480 pixels, and each pixel data presented by temperature value. During experiment procedure, FLIR A645 takes 750 thermal images in 30 s. Thermal images obtained from the thermal infrared imager have a large area of void for HTs detection, as shown in the left side in Fig. 3 . Therefore, the thermal image data in the areas surrounded by the white square loop were investigated in this paper. 3.2 Thermal images data processing Thermal images data processing is the core of this paper, and includes three parts: data pre-processing, data difference and Kalman filtering. In order to show the relationship between temperature and time, data pre-processing accumulates all the useful pixels data from the thermal images in a new matrix. And the new matrix consists of 750 rows, and each row is made up of all pixels data from one thermal image. As shown in the right side of Fig. 3, the three dimensional diagram of the new matrix and each section of the diagram represents a thermal image. Data difference includes two parts: self-difference and mutual-difference. Self-difference is all the thermal image data from chip will be subtracted by the initial mean value which from the same chip’s first thermal image. Mutual-difference is the comparison between testing chips and golden chip to highlight the influence of HTs and obtain the DT matrix. The thermal images data from FLIR A645 contains a lot of white noise and brings seriously influence on HTs detection. Kalman filter can effectively filter the white noise. During the filtering, the value of each pixel variations during the testing will be considered as a single point to filter, leading to accurately describe the change of each pixel’s temperature as a function of time. 4 Authentication experimental setup The testing chips are Xilinx Spartan3E FPGAs, and each testing chip consists of many programmable heating modules and with or without HT. The programmable heating module is a power programmable ring oscillator, as shown in upper left side of Fig. 4 , the frequency (from 50 to 200 MHz) of clock (CLK) signal can control the output power of this module, and this module will replace the real circuits to generate heat for cover up the heat generated by HT. HT is instead of a NAND gate, and drived by CLK’ signal which also can control the output power of HT, as shown in lower left side of Fig. 4. Finally, two layout methods were adopted in the experiment, marked as Line Layout (L-layout) and Surface Layout (S-layout), as shown in right side of Fig. 4. The proportions of logic units occupied by HT and programmable heating modules are 0.45% and 0.29%, respectively. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HT detection method, each programmable heating module is driving by different frequency CLK signal, and the HT is only driving by 100 MHz CLK’ signal. 5 Results and analysis Two Spartan3E FPGAs have been tested, one was tested as golden chip, and the other was the testing chip and has been tested with or without HT. Fig. 5 shows the experiment results of DT values distribution after Kalman filtering. Fig. 5(a), (c), (e) and (g) shows the DT distribution from 750 thermal images on HT-free chips and HT-insertion chips. Fig. 5(b), (d), (f) and (h) shows the DT density distribution from 700th differential thermal image (the DT resolution is 0.01 ℃). Fig. 5(a) and (e) shows that the DT values are relatively stable on HT-free chips, and most DT are near 0 ℃. And from Fig. 5(c) and (g), the DT values present an obvious rise trend on HT-insertion chips, and most of them are more than 0 ℃. Fig. 5(b) and (f) shows a high DT density distribution within −0.1 to 0 on HT-free chips, and the maximum probability DT value has more than 2000 pixels. Compared with Fig. 5(b) (f), (d) and (h) show wider distribution range (almost from 0 to 0.3) and lower distribution density about the DT values on HT-insertion chips, and the maximum probability DT value is only about 1000 pixels. As a conclusion, the existence of a HT will increase the DT values and expand the range of DT distribution. The maximum DT value was probably resulted from HTs, as the red bold line represents in Fig. 5(c) and (g), and this value can be used for HT’s locating. In order to highlight the existence of HT, all the DT values from750 differential thermal images on HT-insertion chips were superimposed together and restored to thermal images, as shown in Fig. 6 , the location of the HTs are inside the red circle. Affected by the shooting angle of thermal imager, the location of HTs may be different from the layout maps. 6 Conclusion HTs insertions will change the thermal characteristics of ICs. In this paper, we proposed a more accurate HT detection method based on DT matrix through thermal image. The matrix combines all the pixels’ DT values on the thermal images vary with time and makes detection results more intuitive. Results show HT has been detected and located in two proportion of logic units occupied by HT and programmable heating modules (0.45% and 0.29% respectively), and HT was only a logical gate size. The purpose of the experiment is to verify the effectiveness of the detection method, therefore the diversity of HTs and simulation circuits were not considered in the experimental setup, and the future works will design more circuits to analysis and modify the locating method.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.045,Optical and electrical studies of CdS thin films with thickness variation,"Abstract Cadmium sulphide (CdS) is the n-type, wide band gap II-VI semiconducting material by offering applications in photovoltaics. Among the range of applications offered by CdS thin films, it has found application as a window layer in second generation solar cells by creating photon traps, thereby quantum efficiency. Closed space sublimation (CSS) offers a trivial yet effective approach for the synthesis of thin films for solar cell applications at moderate temperatures. CdS thin films of controlled thicknesses were synthesized by CSS technique by varying exposure time. X-rays diffraction data of these thin films revealed polycrystalline nature with a preferred orientation along (002) direction. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based morphological studies showed grain size variation with an increase in thickness of deposited thin films in the range of 300–500 nm. The electrical studies revealed high resistivity of the order of 106 Ω-cm. Spectrophotometric studies performed for CdS thin films concluded with the calculation of the optical parameters such as refractive index, absorption coefficient employing the Swanepoel model, and energy band gap of ∼2.42 eV using the Tauc relation in addition to thin film thickness confirmation. The variations in thickness affect the structure, surface, optical (Khan et al. 2018), electrical properties.",Apr-18," Keywords II-VI thin films Activation energy Optical Electrical Second generation solar cell 1 Introduction After initial sparkle of single crystal Silicon (c-Si) based the first generation of solar cells, the second generation also called polycrystalline solar cells have been a key research avenue for solar cell scientists. The latter generation is based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) absorbent material, a low cost, II-VI compound semiconductor material [2]. The compound semiconductors such as cadmium sulphide (CdS), zinc telluride (ZnTe), zinc selenide (ZnSe) are large band gap materials that have found applications in Light emitting diodes (LED) [3], photo catalysis [4], detectors [5] and photovoltaics [1,6,7]. Efficient thin films based photonic devices can be fabricated by employing a various thin film fabrication technologies [8,9]. CdS is an n-type potential window layer material in CdTe [7] based solar cells, with energy band gap of 2.42 eV [10]. Many techniques have been used to synthesize CdS thin films including chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [11] and physical vapour deposition (PVD), chemical bath deposition (CBD) [12], thermal evaporation [13], pulsed laser [14] and close spaced sublimation (CSS) techniques [15]. Encouraging results have been attained by using CSS technique for the second generation based solar cells [16]. CSS is simple, inexpensive thin film deposition technique, famous for its efficient use of material, small source-substrate separation and high throughput under low vacuum conditions [17]. The heterojunction between CdS (window layer) and CdTe (absorbent layer), constitutes a p-n junction in the second-generation solar cell. For CSS deposited CdS thin films, the c-axes are perpendicular to the substrate along with the vertical growth of crystallite in columnar form. This effect allows fewer grain boundaries and therefore can control the flow of charge carriers parallel to the junction. The necessary window layer characteristics include high transparency with low resistivity, [9,17] so that incident radiation can transmit through the window layer arrive at absorbent layer with minimum losses. The optical absorption coefficient must be less than the absorbent layer i.e., ∼105 cm−1. A very thin window layer with a thickness in nanometers range may thus help overcome the absorption losses and enhance the open circuit voltage. Energy band gap of window layer should be larger than the absorbent layer with minimum lattice mismatch [2]. Since photocurrent is not generated in the window layer, so the direct bandgap material can be used as a window layer. Fabrication techniques and the growth parameters play a vital role to control the thickness [17,18]. Here we present on the influence of thickness on structural and morphological characteristics alongside electrical and optical properties of CSS deposited CdS thin films. The structure of the as-deposited transparent and yellowish CdS thin films were studied by X-rays diffractometer with Cu k-α line at a wavelength of 1.5406 Ǻ. The surface morphology was studied through scanning electron microscope (SEM) whereas optical properties including refractive index, absorption coefficient, energy band gap and consequently thickness of thin films by spectrophotometer. The electrical properties such as conductivity, resistivity and mobility were studied by Hall measurement apparatus. The correlation between structure, surface, optical and electrical properties were studied for the potential use of CdS thin film as a window layer in CdTe based solar cell. 2 Experimental Cadmium sulphide (CdS) powder (99.99%-Aldrich Company) was used as a source material placed in a graphite boat. Soda-lime glass slides (7.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 2.5 cm) were used as substrates for deposition of thin films. The optimized source-substrate separation was 5 mm for superior quality films. Halogen lamp L1 (L2) power rating 1000 W (500 W) was used for direct heating of source (substrate) to the optimized temperature of 600 ± 5 °C (450 ± 5 °C). The temperatures at both source and substrate were monitored by K-type thermocouples. Both lamps were switched ON only after rotary and diffusion pumps evacuated the chamber to 10−4 mbar. The variation of deposition time from 60 to 420 s controlled the thickness of thin films after attaining the optimized temperature. After this time interval, the lamp heating source was switched off and however the other lamp heating substrate was used to anneal the deposited thin films. This annealing at vacuum, ensured rearrangement of thin film constituents in a uniform manner, without contamination on exposure to air, and hence may reduce the resistivity and enhance the crystal structure and optical properties [2,19]. Eventually, this lamp too was switched OFF so that chamber could cool down to the room temperature (RT). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out using X’PERT Pro PANanalytic diffraction machine operated at 40 keV to 30 mA. All morphological aspects are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) providing basic information about particle size, shape and surface features. Optical properties were analyzed using spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 950) in UV-VIS-NIR range using UV-Win Lab software. All electrical measurements were carried out at room temperature (RT). Four-point probe technique was adopted to study the electrical behaviour of as-deposited CdS thin films fabricated by CSS method. Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) studies were conducted to investigate the bending and stretching of functional groups present in the materials. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural study Structure of CdS thin films depends on deposition techniques and its parameters. The crystal structure and crystalline quality of as-deposited CdS thin films were analyzed using non-destructive technique X-ray diffraction (XRD) with diffraction angle ranging from 20° to 60°. XRD peaks have a broad profile which confirms the presence of nanocrystallites, lattice defects and microstrain etc. The background in CdS-01 and CdS-05 of XRD patterns were may be due to amorphous phases in CdS thin films or by amorphous nature of glass substrate. In other CdS thin films, this effect was not so dominant due to the strong interaction between the films and the substrate. The as-deposited CdS thin films showed polycrystalline behaviour. XRD analysis exhibits mixed hexagonal and cubic phases of CdS, the planes observed by the scattering from (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103). The broadened peaks are indicating that the size of CdS is in nano-ranges. The XRD pattern showed intense peak is of (002) according to the corresponding orientation of CdS thin films at 26.56°. The lowest free energy is responsible for the growth of (002) parallel to the substrate surface. The peaks were matched manually with the reference card of ICDD 00-001-0780. The preferred orientation (002) corresponds to wurtzite hexagonal structure in CdS thin films. The other reflection peaks (220) were matched with the reference card ICDD 00-001-0647 showed the cubic zinc blende system in CdS thin films. The variation in the deposition time of films allows more atoms to reach the substrate and thus increase thin film thickness. During a typical thin film growth process, the formation of new crystallites and the increase in grain size of already nucleated grains occur side by side controlled by deposition temperature. If the rate of formation of new crystallites outpaced the rate at which already nucleated grains grow, the diffraction intensities would decrease as observed in Fig. 1 . Consequently, the FWHM decreased with dwell time, due to the formation of new smaller grains on the surface of larger grains. Crystallite size D was estimated using Scherrer’s formula [9,20–23] (1) D = k λ β cos θ Here, machine constant k was 0.9, wavelength (λ) of source used 1.5406 Ǻ, θ is the Bragg’s angle (in radians), and β is a full-width half maximum of XRD spectral peaks. The calculated sizes of crystallites were in the range 24 – 32 n m . It was observed that crystallite size changed with the increase in the thickness of the CdS thin films. It is considered that more atoms can move a relatively longer distance and thermally occupy lattice site for the grain. Dislocation density, ρ is a measure of defects in the crystal [24]. It was in range 0.98 – 1.68 × 10 15 l i n e s m - 2 , when calculated using Scherrer’s formula, ρ = 1 / D 2 . The strain (ε) within thin film [7] given by relation ε = β c o s θ 4 varied from 1.08 × 10 - 3 to 1.42 × 10 - 3 . FWHM of the peaks decreased with increase in thicknesses of CdS thin films, thus confirming inverse relation between D and crystallinity and hence it is concluded that increase in thickness improved crystallinity. As the thickness increased, the crystallite size changed, so dislocation density and strain decreases [17]. The (002) peak shifts toward higher angular value confirming the change of crystallite size with thickness changes also related to stacking fault probability (αsf ) [25]. (2) α s f = 2 π 2 Δ ( 2 θ ) 45 3 t a n θ The probability of stacking fault decreased with increase in thickness of CdS thin films. The stress and dislocation density have large values for less thickness and has a higher mismatch between the film and the substrate. The increase in thickness is one of the reasons for the decrease in stress and dislocation density of CdS thin films. This effect confirms the saturation of crystallite growth by releasing the misfit strain between the substrate and the CdS thin films with an increase in thickness and finally stacking fault probability decreases. The change in thickness also showed that shift in peaks of CdS which caused a decrease in lattice constant which shows substitution effects. Thickness effects can also be seen through the peak intensities shown in Fig. 1. The ratio of preferred orientation peak to (101)/(002), (102)/(002), (110)/(002) and (103)/(002) shows the reorientation of the planes. The crystal structure and the variation in lattice constant related to the variation in thickness of CdS thin films. Since the value of c / a approached 1.633 with an increase in thickness, it can be inferred tensile strain decreased along [002] directions parallel to c- axis inversely with a thickness of thin film. Texture coefficient (TC) is another crucial factor which could influence the physical properties of CdS thin films. It measures the degree of orientation of each peak to the randomly oriented sample. (3) T . C . = I ( h k l ) I o ( h k l ) 1 N ∑ i = 0 n I h k l I o h k l - 1 Here I ( h k l ) and I o ( h k l ) are the diffraction intensity of observed and standard samples respectively and N denotes the number of reflected peaks. Since T.C. decreased proportionally from 3.31 to 0.37 with the thickness, it confirms the improvement in crystallinity of film structure with processing time. Increase in growth time influences the texture coefficient on the surface of crystallites of the CdS thin films. On a concluding note, it is observed that increase in thickness has an inverse relation with strain and dislocation density and T.C. and crystallite size directly influenced by it. These structural parameters summarized in Table 1 may enhance the physical properties of as-deposited CdS thin films. 3.2 Surface analysis The study of surface morphology of thin film provides useful and valuable information on shape, size and particle arrangements. The SEM micrographs show the surface morphology of as-deposited CdS thin films as shown in Fig. 2 . The images clearly show the irregular shapes, non-uniform grain sizes and voids in the as-deposited CdS thin films also the surface smoothness changed as thickness changed. Grain sizes of as-deposited CdS thin films depend strongly depend upon thickness. The average grain size of as-deposited CdS thin films is 50 nm. In principle, after deposition for various time durations, the atoms diffuse into CdS and organize themselves for bigger grains. The coalescences play a vital role in CdS thin films when the thickness is increased, small grains coalesce with each other when due to ad-atoms [26–29]. These atoms may displace from interstitially or Cd and S atoms interchange their positions which is also changes the composition of as-deposited CdS thin films. One possibility is the self-interstitial on the CdS lattice. The increase in thickness is responsible for re-crystallization of grains, which promotes the reorientation of the overall microstructure [27–30]. SEM micrographs clearly indicate a remarkable increase in grain sizes of as-deposited CdS thin films. The change in the thickness also indicates the improvement in crystallinity, the stress produced due to grains and defects resulting in the increase in grain sizes [30]. The SEM image of the as-deposited CdS thin film also demonstrates roughness [26], which was reduced as the thickness of as-deposited CdS thin film increased. The grains present in as-deposited CdS thin film also became irregular and diverse in sizes as the thickness changes. The increase in thickness also facilitated in triggering the process of coalescence. The re-crystallization of grain’s growth in semiconductors are reported comprehensively. 3.3 Optical study Investigations of optical properties like energy band gap, refractive index and transmission are of much significance in case of optoelectronics applications. The transmission spectra of as-deposited CdS thin films shown in Fig. 3 show strong absorption edge at ∼500 nm. The oscillations are due to the constructive and destructive interference, the maxima related to the constructive interference and the minima is due to destructive interference. The CdS thin films have transmissions in the range of 60–85% invisible region. Since UV region consists of greater energy as compared to the energy band gap of CdS, hence, it is thoroughly absorbed. The NIR and visible region, however, are entirely transparent. The as-deposited CdS thin films are well-thought-out for this reason, acts as a window material for visible as well as the infrared region. Transmission spectrums in Fig. 3 indicate the effects of thickness on optical properties like energy band gap, absorption coefficient and refractive index etc. These properties were measured using transmittance data and fitting the transmittance curve [24,31] by Eq (4) T = A x B − C x cos ( ϕ ) + D x 2 The parameters A = 16 n 2 s , B = n + 1 2 ( n + s 2 ) , C = 2 ( n 2 - s 2 ) ( n 2 - 1 ) , D = n - s 2 n - 1 3 , Φ = 4 π n d / λ , x = e x p ( - d α ) , k = α λ / 4 π . Here s and n are the refractive indices of glass substrate and the film respectively. Absorption of the film in transparent region could be due to the scattering of light, defect absorption, multi-phonon absorption, or Urbach tail. Absorption process reliant on the wavelength is complex; hence, if the absorption is minute around phonon energy far from any absorption line, Taylor series is used. ‘α’ can be expressed using the relation α = c + f λ + g λ 2 + . . . , here, f and g are constants. The calculation of α in the region of high absorption could be done by using n and d by curve fitting. The region of high and medium region of absorption precise solution for x in Eq. (4) gives the value of α at every wavelength. (5) x = ( C ′ + A / T ) − ( ( C ′ + A / T ) 2 − 4 B D ) 1 / 2 2 D Here, C ' = C × cos ϕ and α = - l n ( x ) / d . Increase in anneal time of CdS showed variations in transmission, refractive index and energy band gap. Energy band gap is calculated [20,32–36] using Eq. (6): (6) α h v = A ( h v − E g ) N / 2 α is measured using the well-known relation: α = - 1 d l n ( T ) . Here, d and T are thickness and the transmittance respectively of the CdS thin films shown in Fig. 4 . Thickness was calculated by using Eq. (7). Thickness of the CdS thin film can be calculated using relation: (7) d = λ max λ min 4 n ( λ max − λ min ) Where, d: thickness of CdS thin film, λmin: minimum and λMax : the maximum value of the wavelength extracted from the transmission spectra. A significant decrease in transmission is demonstrated after an increase in thickness Fig. 5 . The value of thickness varies from 270 to 680 nm as deposition time increased. The band gap values were 2.38 to 2.45 eV as shown in Fig. 4. It is observed that by increasing thickness, the value of band gap shortly decreased. The decrease in transmission of CdS thin film has been observed from 40% to 80% by increasing thickness. The values of refractive index changes from 2.2 to 3.47 as thickness increased as shown in Fig. 5. The transmission of CdS thin film gradually decreased because of increasing refractive index. The variation in energy band gap and the refractive index is the removal of defects states from forbidden energy gap with an increase in thickness as shown in Fig. 5. The maximum value of energy band gap and the refractive index suggested that thickness of CdS thin film was good for window layer further increase in thickness produced structural disordered and defects states in CdS thin films. 3.4 Electrical study The conductivity in a semiconductor depends upon temperature and discussed by different models based on mobility edge and density of states. The electronic conduction in semiconductors is mediated by three mechanisms for different ranges of temperature [37], • Transport the carriers excited into non-localized states at valance or conduction band. • Transport the carriers excited into localized states at the hopping and bad edge. • When there are finite density states from the carrier with energy near Ef which can hop between localized states. A major concern in electrical measurements is mobility; resistivity, carrier concentration, types of semiconductors. The electrical properties e.g. resistivity, carrier concentrations of as-deposited CdS thin films were calculated at room temperature. The n-type conductivity was confirmed by Hall measurement. The thickness affects the resistivity of as-deposited CdS thin films shown in Fig. 6 . The resistivity of as-deposited CdS thin films was ∼105 Ω-cm. As the thickness increases, resistivity decreases, and consequently the increase of carrier concentration in CdS films. The decrease in resistivity with an increase in thickness might be due to the less number of defects and ordered structure of CdS thin films. The activation energy is a measure of trapping levels and hence the decrease showed the redistribution of traps. A slight change in activation energies were observed for the thin films in range from 5.24 ± 0.24 – 3.2 ± 0.11 eV. The change in activation energy is due to the removal of defect states which are present in the CdS thin films. The slopes of conductivity v/s temperature have been shown as shown in Fig. 7 . It is considered that the activation energy related to donor levels which are associated with the surface states or shallow traps created by Sulphur vacancies in CdS thin films. 3.5 Composition analysis FTIR measurements have been done to understand the defects and impurity contents and compositional structure of CdS thin films. The FTIR transmission spectra for CdS films in Fig. 8 were acquired in the wave number ranging from 400 to 4000 cm−1. The transmission bands at 730.6, 741.8, 742.2 and 762.7 cm−1 were assigned to the CdS [38] stretching frequency. The other major peaks at 872.9, 2850.2 and 2919.1 cm−1 correspond to C-H bending, CH fingerprint region (1716.4 and 1733.8 cm−1). The broad absorption band at 3521.2 cm−1 is due to the OH stretching vibrations of water (H2O) molecules [38], A strong band at 1563.3 due to CC stretching band is also noted, CH Bending mode (1423.0). 4 Conclusions The XRD patterns showed the polycrystalline behaviour of as-deposited thin films with preferred orientation was [002] direction. A shift was observed in-plane peaks as the thickness increased result the increase in crystallite size of the as-deposited CdS thin film. The SEM micrographs showed the smooth, non-uniform grain sizes and a rough surface having voids in it. The roughness is important for light trapping through window layer and the voids correspond the surface defects, as the thickness increases the voids decreases confirming the decrease in surface defects. The optical energy band gap decreases as the thickness increases also transmission decreases, so more thick films are not suitable for window layer. The as-deposited CdS thin films were highly resistive, the thickness also showed a decrease in resistivity of the as-deposited CdS thin films. These results may confirm that the variations in thickness strongly affect the physical properties of as-deposited CdS thin films used as a window layer.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.112,Circuit modeling of tunable terahertz graphene absorber,"Abstract In this work an efficient circuit model of functional thin-film graphene assisted metamaterial (GM) devices with exploiting transmission line theory (TLT) is presented. In our proposed model, graphene sheet layer considered as parallel R-L-C circuits and the other parts of the devices modeled as circuit elements. Here we develop the structure and design multi-layer unpattern GM absorber. To evaluate robustness, performance and accuracy of our developed TLT method, the results obtained from an easy to implement MATLAB code for a GM absorber have been compared with those obtained from full-wave simulations and analytical approach. Our proposed method in addition to reducing the calculation time and the need for less memory compared to full-wave simulations, is in good agreement with the full-wave and analytical simulations (with an error less than 3%). By changing chemical potential and/or dielectric thickness of the GM absorber, the absorption peek’s frequency could be tuned in terahertz band as desired, indicating the potential applications of the absorber in sensors and filters.",Apr-18," Keywords Circuit model Terahertz Graphene Absorber Transmission line theory 1 Introduction In recent years, Nano technology has provided novel solutions for engineering society, to the extent that fabrication of electronic devices for specific application are realized and appropriately discussed. In any effort to increase sustainability and energy efficiency, neither productivity nor quality should suffer–quite the opposite should be the case. Increased sustainability and efficiency can only be achieved through the use of reliable and modern technology. Nowadays, Terahertz (THz) technology has attracted the attention of many researchers by utilizing new materials. Graphene based devices outperform silicon products, regarding higher operational frequency, design efficiency and even fewer losses. So researchers hope, graphene will paved the way to new era of high frequency-high efficiency electronics and optical devices. As a two dimensional substance, Graphene shows transparent structure with hexagonal shape, has attracted a lot of attention due to its excellent physical, electrical and optical properties [1]. Extensive research and investigations have begun and continue to design, description and implementation of graphene-based Nano devices. Long and highlighted list of these researches is exist. In application point of view for instance, modulators [2–4], tunable reflectors, filters, absorbers and polarizers [5–8] are among most known fields. Due to the high potential of terahertz absorbers in sensing, imaging and detecting [9–11] THz metamaterial absorbers are in major interest and play an important role in many devices like biosensing, imaging and communications [12]. Graphene’s ability to supporting surface Plasmon Polariton-based absorbers at terahertz frequency has made it one of the best materials for designing THz-wave absorbers [5,13–19]. The absorbers based on graphene in THz band can be tunable and broadband [20–21] which is the need of some applications. In the other hand, the necessity of the other applications is tunable narrow band absorbers that research on this issue continues [22]. Narrow band or single-band metamaterial perfect absorbers (MPAs) have important applications in thermal imaging, detection of materials, and biological sensing, in many cases, such as in the simultaneous monitoring and detection of some explosive materials or hazardous substances, multiple-band and even broadband MPAs are necessary [23]. As the demand for the process of designing applications in terahertz frequency band increases, the provision of a circuit model for these structures is very important, since all parts of the terahertz device can be easily analyzed with the circuit model. Here we develop and extend a transmission line theory to model and design a tunable narrow band terahertz graphene absorber. We suggest a simple but powerful circuit model for GM description and tunable narrow band GM design. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the structure is explained and the proposed circuit model is presented. In Section 3, design of GM absorber based on circuit model will be discussed and results are drawn in Section 4. Finally the paper has been concluded in Section 5. 2 Structure and circuit model A schematic of the unit cell of the studied GM absorber illustrated in Fig. 1 and graphene is embedded into polyethylene cyclic olefin copolymer (Topas polymer with np = 1.53) which has low losses in THz band [24]. The thickness of graphene layer and the square length of unit cell are considered Δ = 2 nm and 15 μm respectively. The surface conductivity of graphene is derived using the well-known Kubo formula [25]. At sufficiently low frequencies, when ℏω << 2 μc (which includes THz regime) interband term of conductivity is negligible and intraband transition is considered solely, so graphene surface conductivity can be written as (with exp (jωt) time harmonic dependency) [25,26]: (1) σ g ω , μ c , τ , T = σ int r a = − j e 2 k B T π ℏ 2 ( ω − j τ − 1 ) × μ c K B T + 2 ln exp ( − μ c K B T ) + 1 where e is the electron charge, KB is the Boltzman constant, ℏ is the reduced Planck’s constant, τ is the relaxation time of electrones, T is the temperature and μ c is the chemical potential. In this work, we use T = 300 K (ambient temperature) and τ = 1 ps. In Fig. 1, the structure located upon a metallic ground plane (reflection = −1) and a Fabry-Perot resonator like is formed. It should be noted that this configuration is polarization insensitive (under normal incidence). In a symmetrical environment for embedded graphene (n1 = n2, see Fig. 2 ) the maximal absorbance cannot exceed 50% but we can gain larger absorbance if we use more conductive layers of graphene separated with a dielectric spacer [14]. In the terahertz frequency band, the thickness of the graphene layer is much smaller than the wavelength. In such situations, thickness can be ignored and the conductive layer is considered as a point load [14], as shown in Fig. 2. In pursuit of model whole structure as circuit elements by exploiting transmission line theory, dielectric layer can be modeled as either capacitance or inductive depending on its thickness in order to satisfy the absorption goal and the metallic ground plane represent a short circuit. So, if we can model unpatterned graphene layer as circuit elements, we can provide a circuit model for entire structure as depicted in Fig. 3 . In practical applications the most important case is normal incidence, therefor we drive the formula for specification of circuit elements under normal incident. In this model ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum and indicating of Z0 = 120π, where Z0 is the impedance of free space. For the equivalent impedance of different parts, the following equations are extracted: (2) Z 1 = j Z p . tan ( β p d n ) (3) Z 2 = Z 1 . Z g n Z 1 + Z g n (4) Z 3 = Z p Z 2 + j Z p . tan ( β p d n − 1 ) Z p + j Z 2 . tan ( β p d n − 1 ) where Zp  = Z0 /nd is the impedance of dielectric intermediate layers and βp is the propagation constant of propagating THz wave in the dielectric material. Based on [20,27], a periodic array graphene ribbons (PAGR) could be modeled with an infinite number of parallel R-L-C circuits, each representing a mode of the structure. As a result, by considering W = D for the studied PAGR in [27] (where D and W are the period and the width of the graphene ribbons), we can characterized a continuous graphene sheet as illustrated in Fig. 4 . The resistance, inductance and capacitance of the n’th mode are calculated as follows [27]: (5) R n = D S n 2 π ℏ 2 e 2 E F τ , L n = R n τ , C n = D S n 2 2 ε e f f Q n where εeff  = ε0(ε1  + ε2)/2 (Subtitles 1 and 2 refer to the permittivity of dielectric materials which surround the continuous graphene sheet on both sides), Sn is the integral of the eigenfunctions of equation governing the surface current given in Table 1 of [27] and Qn  = qn(π /W) is the eigenvalue of that equation which is given in Table 2 of [27] and in our case (W/D = 1) q1 = 0.28 is selected. In this paper for simplicity, we consider only the first mode and it was be noted that the final results will be obtained without this consideration. So, the impedance of each continuous layer of graphene will be: (6) Z g = R 1 + j ω L 1 + 1 j ω C 1 Which in our proposed structure, the values of R1, L1 and C1 for all the graphene layer except the first one are the same. By continuing the calculations in the same way as described above, the input impedance of the structure can be obtained as follows: (9) Z 2 n − 1 = Z p Z 2 n − 2 + j Z p t a n ( β p d 1 ) Z p + j Z 2 n − 2 t a n ( β p d 1 ) (8) Z i n = Z g 1 . Z 2 n − 1 Z g 1 + Z 2 n − 1 Now we can analyze the absorption of GM absorber using circuit analysis which is presented in next section. 3 Design based on circuit model Here by exploiting circuit analysis we intend to analyze and design the GM absorber. From the point of view of the fields and the waves, impedances between two transmission lines must be adapted for perfect absorption (A = 1). It means that the conditions are: Real(Zin) = Z0 and Im(Zin) = 0. But if we consider the goal of design A ≥ 0.9 and use these relations: A = 1-|Г|2 and Г = (Zin-Z0)/(Zin + Z0),its lead to |Г|≤0.32 and 194.2 ≤ Zin ≤ 731.8. So, by satisfying this relation for Zin in the desired frequency band, the design goal can be achieved without the need for full-wave simulations that take a lot of time. In equation (2), dn can be chosen such a way βpdn = π/2, So The effect of the last dielectric layer which has the most thickness between the dielectric layers disappears and the thickness of the remaining layers is very low due to the nature of the GM absorber and in this work the thickness of dielectric spacer is 4 nm. The continuation of the design process depends on the graphene parameters and the values of the R-L-C that the graphene layers produce, which should be in such a way to satisfy the equation obtained for Zin in the desired frequency band. This can be easily done using optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA) or PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithms. For instance, we used a simple genetic algorithm to design a dual band absorber with graphene double-layer at frequencies 0.4 and 1.136 THz which the input impedance for this implementation is shown in Fig. 5 . The obtained parameters to meet the design goal for these two frequencies are presented in Table 1 . 4 Results Now let us verify the accuracy of our proposed circuit model by comparing its results with the results of full-wave simulations in ref [14]. The studied structure is a graphene double-layer absorber with a = 15 μm, h = 35.9 μm and τ = 1ps, where a is the square length of unit cell and h is the dielectric thickness. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the results of our proposed circuit model are in a very good agreement with the full-wave numerical modeling. Moreover, in pursuit of evaluating performance of our method, we use the analytical approach besides full-wave simulations and the structure has been simulated up to 20 THz and compared with the results of our developed TLT model, as depicted in Fig. 6(b). In the analytic method, we use impedance transformation by exploiting this expression [28]: (9) Z i n ( z ) = η 2 η 3 + j η 2 tan ( β 2 d 2 ) η 2 + j η 3 tan ( β 2 d 2 ) where η2 is the characteristic impedances of medium 2, η3 is the wave impedance of total field of Previous layers, β2 is the propagation constant of propagating wave in medium 2, d2 is the thickness of medium 2 and we are looking the structure at the interface between medium 1 and 2. To analyze the design tunability of the presented method and its ability to move the absorption peaks in THz regime, we design four graphene double-layer absorber in different frequencies which details of these Structures are given in Table 1 and the absorption diagram of two structures are illustrated in Fig. 7 . As shown in this figure, the designed absorbers are multi-band and show a fluctuating behavior (Immediately after high absorption, its absorption reaches zero), which is very functional matter in sensing applications point of view. In order to analyze robustness of the presented method, the absorber with four and six continuous graphene sheet for frequencies 4.99 and 5.12 THz have been designed (which details are in Table 1) and its results are compared with results of full-wave simulations and analytical approach, as shown in Fig. 8 . Our results show that by adding more continuous graphene layers to the graphene double-layer structure (making it difficult to fabricate) the absorption peak’s frequency shifts a bite to the higher frequencies. Figs. 9 and 10 show how the first and second resonant frequencies of the graphene double-layer configuration gradually varies with the graphene Fermi level and dielectric thickness (dn which illustrated in Fig. 1). As shown in these figures, the results obtained by our developed TLT are in excellent agreement with those obtained from full-wave simulations. The first and second peaks of the structure is plotted in these figures, where red dashes and blue dots representing full-wave approach and the circle and square markers representing results of the developed TLT method. Eventually, it is worth discussing about our proposed method compared with full-wave simulations in terms of reducing the computational time and the need for less memory. For the studied structure, it takes more than 10 min to complete analysis using the frequency-domain electromagnetic solver with a computer possessing the following characteristics: processor, Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz; installed memory (RAM), 8.0 GB. While, for the same computer the computation time with our proposed method is less than 0.5 s. So, we can analyze these structures at a noticeable less time exploiting a simple and easy to implement MATLAB code. 5 Conclusion We have proposed a method to model graphene metamaterial with circuit elements using Transmission line theory and investigate GM absorbers. Since the graphene sheet is relatively ultra-thin compared to the wavelength (in THz regime), it was considered as a point load in circuit model. Analytical and full-wave simulations confirm the validity, accuracy and robustness of our circuit approach to model GM absorbers while making benefits in terms of simulation time and memory sources. By modeling the GM structure as circuit elements, we proposed a circuit approach to design a multi-layer GM absorber at desired frequency band by exploiting optimization algorithms.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.131,Optical soliton perturbation for complex Ginzburg–Landau equation with modified simple equation method,Abstract The modified simple equation method applied to perturbed complex Ginzburg–Landau equation gives dark and singular solutions to the model. The perturbation terms appear with full nonlinearity. There are eight nonlinear forms studied in this paper. These solitons appear with constraint conditions that gurantee its existence and these are also presented.,Apr-18," OCIS Codes 060.2310 060.4510 060.5530 190.3270 190.4370 Keywords Solitons Perturbation Full nonlinearity Modified simple equation equation method 1 Introduction The complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (CGLE) is one of the many models that studies the dynamics of optical soliton propagation through a wide range of waveguides such as crystals, optical fibers, optical couplers, optical metamaterials and metasurfaces as well as PCF. This model is an extended version of the usual nonlinear Schrödinger's equation that is visible all across. These models and other nonlinear evolution equations, that arise in mathematical photonics as well as other areas of mathematical physics, are all successfully addressed by the modified simple equation method [1–10]. When perturbation terms are turned on, the perturbed CGLE will be addressed in this paper by the modified simple equation method. There are eight forms of nonlinear media that will be studied. All of these nonlinear forms will lead to the retrieval of dark and singular soliton solutions to the governing model. The existence of these solitons will be guaranteed with the constraint conditions in the parameters. The perturbation terms are all of Hamiltonian type. After a quick recapitulation of this integration scheme, soliton solutions will be derived in the subsequent subsections. 1.1 The model The dimensions form of CGLE is [2–4,6–8]: (1) iq t + aq xx + bF | q | 2 q = 1 | q | 2 q * α | q | 2 | q | 2 xx − β | q | 2 x 2 + γ q where x is the spatial variable that represents the non-dimensional distance along the fiber, while t is the temporal variable. Then, a, b, α, β and γ are valued constants. The coefficients a and b come from the group velocity dispersion and nonlinearity, respectively. The terms with α and β are additional nonlinear terms and γ comes from detuning effect. In (1), F is real-valued algebraic function and it is necessary to possess the smoothness of the complex function F | q | 2 q is k times continuously differentiable, so that F | q | 2 q ∈ ∪ ∞ m , n = 1 C k ( ( − n , n ) × ( − m , m ) ; R 2 ) . In presence of perturbation terms, CGLE gets extended to [4]: (2) iq t + aq xx + bF | q | 2 q = 1 | q | 2 q * α | q | 2 | q | 2 xx − β | q | 2 x 2 + γ q + i δ q x + λ | q | 2 m q x + μ | q | 2 m x q where δ is the inter-modal dispersion that arises in addition to chromatic dispersion, λ represents the self-steepening effect for short pulses and μ is the higher–order dispersion coefficient. The parameter m accounts for full nonlinearity. 2 Revisitation of the integration algorithm Suppose we have a nonlinear evolution equation in the form [1,5,9,10]: (3) P u , u t , u x , u tt , u xt , u xx , . . . = 0 where P is a polynomial in u(x, t) and its partial derivatives in which the highest order derivatives and nonlinear terms are involved. In the following, we give the main steps of this method. Step-1: We use the transformation (4) u ( x , t ) = U ( ξ ) , ξ = x − ct , where c is a constant to be determined, to reduce Eq. (3) to the following ODE: (5) Q U , U ′ , U ′ ′ , U ′ ′ ′ , … = 0 where Q is a polynomial in U(ξ) and its total derivatives, while ′ = d/dξ. Step-2: We suppose that Eq. (5) has the formal solution (6) U ( ξ ) = ∑ l = 0 N a l ψ ′ ξ ψ ξ l , where a l are constants to be determined, such that a N  ≠ 0, and ψ ξ is an unknown function to be determined later. Step-3: We determine the positive integer N in Eq. (6) by considering the homogeneous balance between the highest order derivatives and the nonlinear terms in Eq. (5). Step-4: We substitute (6) into (5), then we calculate all the necessary derivatives U′, U ′ ′ , … of the unknown function U(ξ) and we account the function U(ξ). As a result of this substitution, we get a polynomial of ψ ′ ξ / ψ ξ and its derivatives. In this polynomial, we gather all the terms of the same power of ψ − j ξ , j = 0, 1, 2, … and its derivatives, and we equate with zero all the coefficients of this polynomial. This operation yields a system of equations which can be solved to find a k and ψ ξ . Consequently, once can retrieve the exact solutions of Eq. (3). 3 Soliton solutions In order to solve Eq. (2) by the trial equation method, we start with the following wave transformation (7) q ( x , t ) = U ( ξ ) e i ϕ ( x , t ) , q * ( x , t ) = U ( ξ ) e − i ϕ ( x , t ) where U(ξ) represents the shape of the pulse, ξ = x − vt and ϕ =− κx + ωt + θ. The function ϕ(x, t) is the phase component of the soliton, κ is the soliton frequency, while ω is the wave number, θ is the phase constant and v is the velocity of the soliton. Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (2) and then decomposing into real and imaginary parts yields a pair of relations. The imaginary part gives (8) v + δ + 2 a κ + 2 m + 1 λ + 2 m μ U 2 m = 0 while the real part gives (9) a − 2 α U ′ ′ − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ U − κ λ U 2 m + 1 + bF U 2 U − 2 α − 2 β U ′ 2 U = 0 . By choosing α = 2 β the last term of Eq. (9) vanishes. Therefore Eq. (2) changes to (10) iq t + aq xx + bF | q | 2 q = β | q | 2 q * 2 | q | 2 | q | 2 xx − | q | 2 x 2 + γ q + i δ q x + λ | q | 2 m q x + μ | q | 2 m x q and Eq. (9) condenses to (11) a − 4 β U ′ ′ − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ U − κ λ U 2 m + 1 + bF U 2 U = 0 . The imaginary part equation implies (12) v = − 2 a κ − δ and (13) ( 2 m + 1 ) λ + 2 m μ = 0 . Eq. (12) gives the velocity of the soliton and Eq. (13) gives the constraint relation between the two perturbation terms, while Eq. (11) can be integrated to determine the soliton profile. This form for the velocity remains the same for all types of nonlinearity, F(s). 3.1 Kerr law In this case, F ( s ) = s so that Eq. (10) reduces to (14) iq t + aq xx + b | q | 2 q = β | q | 2 q * 2 | q | 2 | q | 2 xx − | q | 2 x 2 + γ q + i δ q x + λ | q | 2 m q x + μ | q | 2 m x q and Eq. (11) simplifies to (15) a − 4 β U ′ ′ − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ U − κ λ U 2 m + 1 + bU 3 = 0 . Balancing U ′ ′ with U 3 in Eq. (15), then we get N = 1. Consequently, we reach (16) U ξ = a 0 + a 1 ψ ′ ξ ψ ξ . Substituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (15) along with m = 1 and setting the coefficients of ψ −j , j = 0,1,2,3 to zero, then we obtain a set of algebraic equations. Solving this system, we obtain (17) a 0 = ± − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ κ λ − b , a 1 = ± 2 a − 4 β κ λ − b , and (18) ψ ′ ′ = ± − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β ψ ′ , (19) ψ ′ ′ ′ = − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β ψ ′ . From Eqs. (18) and (19), we can deduce that (20) ψ ′ = ± − a − 4 β 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ k 1 e ± − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β ξ , and (21) ψ = − a − 4 β 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ k 1 e ± − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β ξ + k 2 , where k 1 and k 2 are constants of integration. Substituting Eqs. (20) and (21) into Eq. (16), we obtain following exact solution to Eq. (14) q x , t = ± − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ κ λ − b ± 2 a − 4 β κ λ − b ± − a − 4 β 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ k 1 e ± − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β ( x − vt ) − a − 4 β 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ k 1 e ± − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β ( x − vt ) + k 2 e i − κ x + ω t + θ If we set k 1 = − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β e ± − 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β ξ 0 , k 2 = ± 1 we obtain: (22) q x , t = ± − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ κ λ − b tanh − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ 2 a − 4 β x − vt + ξ 0 e i − κ x + ω t + θ , (23) q x , t = ± − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ κ λ − b coth − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ 2 a − 4 β x − vt + ξ 0 e i − κ x + ω t + θ , where (22) and (23) represent dark soliton and singular soliton solutions respectively. These solitons are valid for ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β < 0 . (24) q x , t = ± ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ κ λ − b tan ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ 2 a − 4 β x − vt + ξ 0 e i − κ x + ω t + θ , (25) q x , t = ± ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ κ λ − b cot ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ 2 a − 4 β x − vt + ξ 0 e i − κ x + ω t + θ , where (24) and (25) represent singular periodic solutions. These solutions are valid for ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ a − 4 β > 0 . 3.2 Power law In this case, F ( s ) = s n so that Eq. (10) reduces to (26) iq t + aq xx + b | q | 2 n q = β | q | 2 q * 2 | q | 2 | q | 2 xx − | q | 2 x 2 + γ q + i δ q x + λ | q | 2 m q x + μ | q | 2 m x q aand Eq. (11) simplifies to (27) a − 4 β U ′ ′ − ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ U − κ λ U 2 m + 1 + bU 2 n + 1 = 0 . By using transformation U = V 1 2 n , Eq. (27) becomes (28) a − 4 β 1 − 2 n V ′ 2 + 2 nVV ′ ′ − 4 n 2 V 2 ω + a κ 2 + γ + δ κ − 4 n 2 κ λ V m n + 2 + 4 n 2 bV 3 = 0 . Balancing VV ′ ′ or V ′ 2 with V m n + 2 in Eq. (28), then we get N = 2 n m . Setting m = 2n, we reach (29) V ξ = a 0 + a 1 ψ ′ ξ ψ ξ . Substituting Eq. (29) into Eq. (28) and setting the coefficients of ψ −j , j = 0,1,2,3,4 to zero, then we obtain a set of algebraic equations.

There are eight types of nonlinear media that was studied in this paper. The modified simple equation method was the integration scheme applied here and it has its limitations. It can only retrieve dark and singular solitons. This method fails to obtain bright soliton solution to the model. Nevertheless, this method has advantages in studying soliton dynamics. Later," this scheme will be applied to several other models to obtain soliton solutions in optics and other areas of mathematical physics. Those results are awaited currently and will be reported with time. Acknowledgements The work of the seventh author (QZ) was sponsored by the Chutian Scholar Program of Hubei Government in China.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.206,"Design, fabrication and testing of fiber bragg grating based fixed guided beam pressure sensor","Abstract A stainless steel pressure sensor using rigid center diaphragm and a fixed guided beam with FBG sensor is proposed in this paper. Two bare FBGs are bonded on to the tensile and compressive regions of the fixed guided beam. The deflection of the diaphragm due to the applied pressure induces strain on to the fixed guided beam which in-turn shifts Bragg wavelength of the FBG. The sensor is fabricated and tested for its performance in the range of 0–20 bar. The test results are in close agreement with the results obtained from analytical and experimental models. The sensitivity, nonlinearity and resolution of the sensor are found to be 0.103 nm/bar, 0.0008% full scale deflection (FSD) and 0.05 bar. The use of rigid center diaphragm improves the linearity of the sensor for a wider pressure range, and the fixed guided beam provides equal magnitudes of tensile and compressive stresses on the surface of the beam. The differential output in wavelength shifts of the two FBGs nullifies the temperature effect and hence offers temperature compensation.",Apr-18," Keywords Pressure sensor Rigid center diaphragm Fixed guided beam Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) Linearity Temperature compensation 1 Introduction Pressure is an important physical parameter to be measured in almost all fields of engineering and industrial applications. Over the years many potential improvements were realized by using structures like flat diaphragm [1], boss diaphragm [2,3] and embossed diaphragm structures [4] in the fabrication of pressure sensors as they have played a key role in stress transferring mechanism to the sensing element. Structures using stainless steel as fabrication material have an added advantage of usage in, corrosive and harsh environmental applications as they isolate the sensing element from the media. A media compatible stainless steel diaphragm based capacitive pressure sensor developed by Shih-Shian Ho et al. [5] showed a nonlinearity, hysteresis of 3.4% and 2.2% FS, A piezoelectric resonant based pressure sensor with stainless steel diaphragm developed by Y. Sujan et al. [6] for a pressure range of 0–25 bar, showed a nonlinearity, hysteresis of 1.1% and 1.35%. Various types of secondary sensing element like optical, piezoresistive, piezoelectric, capacitance etc have been used along with the diaphragm as the primary sensing element, has been reported in the literature. But optical based Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for sensing the strain caused by induced displacement has received considerable attention in various fiber-optic sensor applications and is a preferred choice in our experimentation owing to its advantages of compact size, high sensitivity, absolute measurement, low cost, multipoint sensing, immunity to electromagnetic interference and easy integration into electronic circuits as highlighted by Marcelo M, Regina C.S.B. Allil et al. [7]. It works on the principal of shift in Bragg wavelength caused by change in strain due to applied pressure. Diverse methods of aligning the FBGs to the primary sensing element to improve the output characteristics have been adopted.A pressure sensor with FBG bonded along the perpendicular axis of a stainless steel circular diaphragm has been designed and tested by Vengal Rao et al. [8] showed a sensitivity, linearity of 0.0205/MPa and 0.998, the other developed by Yanling Xiong et al. [9] displayed a sensitivity, linearity of 0.023/MPa and 0.9720. A FBG pressure sensor based on diaphragm-cantilever structure with FBGs bonded on to the cantilever developed by Min-Fu Liang et al. [10] displayed a sensitivity, linearity of 0.339 nm/MPa and 0.9997 and a double shell cylinder consisting of two steel shells with two FBGs mounted in axial and tangential direction developed and tested by Wentao Zhang et al. [11] displayed a sensitivity of 0.0937nm/MPa, indicating that the alignment of the FBGs affects the sensitivity and linearity of the sensor. In order to achieve higher sensitivity with good linearity novel ways of aligning the FBGs and the primary sensing element design are crucial. However FBG and the structure material are also sensitive to temperature and hence isolating the temperature induced wavelength shift in the FBG based pressure sensors is of great practical importance. To address this issue a number of techniques have been developed, such as a double shell cylinder consisting of two steel shells with two FBGs mounted in axial and tangential direction by Wentao Zhang et al. [11], using a independent reference FBG to sense only temperature by Yong Zhao et al. [12], fabricating two FBG of different diameter fibers as in D. Sengupta et al. [13], a structural element made of three kinds of material with different temperature coefficient of expansion, which can induce negative strain by Y.S. Hsu et al. [14], A FBG based pressure sensor with two FBGs bonded along the radial axis of a large stainless steel circular diaphragm by Jun Huang and Zude Zhou [15], and combining FBG with Fabry-Perot interference devices as suggested by Yuchi Lin and Wei Wang [16]. This paper presents a compact stainless steel integrated structure comprising of a rigid circular diaphragm and a fixed guided beam landing at its centre, with two FBGs mounted in the tensile and compression regions of the fixed guided beam has been designed and tested. The advantage of the proposed sensor is that it is fabricated from a monolithic single metal die, and the stress transfer mechanism proposed provides maximum stress to the FBGs, in addition it provides a simpler mechanism to compensate for temperature, as the structure offers equal magnitudes of tensile and compressive stresses on the surface of the fixed guided beam, compared to the mechanisms already reported in literature. The proposed sensor also exhibits improved linearity, hysteresis, repeatability and offers temperature compensation for a pressure range of 0–20 bar, the pressure sensitivity increases substantially compared to the single FBG based sensing. 2 Sensor design and principle The schematic diagram of the proposed sensor is shown in Fig. 1 . It comprises of a rigid centre diaphragm with a fixed guided beam made of stainless steel (SS) as the primary sensing element and Fiber Bragg Grating strain sensor as the secondary sensing element. As the primary sensing structure consists of multiple individual elements like the diaphragm, rigid mass and the beam it is analyzed separately as section I, section II and evaluated together finally. The section I of the primary sensing element as shown in Fig. 2 a consists of a circular diaphragm with a rigid mass at the centre (rigid centre diaphragm) with radius a, thickness h, rigid mass height c and b the distance of rigid mass from the centre of the diaphragm. The section II as shown in Fig. 2b, consists of a fixed guided beam with length l, width w and thickness t, resting on the rigid centre of the diaphragm, with its guided end free to move vertically along with the rigid centre. This integrated mechanical structure is laser welded on to a stainless steel pressure port (M14 × 1.5) shown in Fig. 1a, for applying input pressure P. The complete sensor with the FBG sensing element after assembly is shown in Fig. 1c. When an input pressure P is applied to the rigid centre diaphragm via the pressure port, the deflection of the diaphragm with its outer edge clamped is governed by the differential equation given by [17] (1) d d r 1 r   d d r r   d y d r =   Q D where y is the deflection at radius r, d y d r is the slope at radius r, Q is the shearing force per unit length and D is the rigidity given by, (2) D =   E h 3 12   ( 1 − μ 2 ) For uniformly distributed load of pressure the equation reduces to, Q   ×   2 π r =   P   ×   π   r 2 (3) d d r 1 r   d d r r   d y d r =   P   r 2 D Integrating (4) 1 r   d d r r   d y d r =   P   r 2 4 D + C 1   (5) r   d y d r =   P   r 4 16 D   +   C 1   r 2 2 +   C 2 The slope and deflection equations of the rigid centre diaphragm are given by (6)   d y d r =   P   r 3 16 D   + C 1 r 2 +   C 2 r (7)   y =   P   r 4 64 D   +   C 1   r 2 4 +   C 2   ln ( r ) +   C 3 The constants C1,C2 and C3 are obtained by applying appropriate boundary conditions. At the clamped end of the diaphragm the slope and deflection are d y d r   ( r = a ) =   0     a n d     y ( r = a ) =   0         (8)   P   a 3 16 D   + C 1   a 2 +   C 2 a   = 0 (9)   P   a 4 64 D   + C 1   a 2 4 +   C 2 ln ( a ) + C 3   = 0 At the rigid mass end of the diaphragm the slope is d y d r ( r = b ) =   0   (10)   P   b 3 16 D   + C 1   b 2 +   C 2 b = 0 Solving for constants C1, C2 and C3 from the above Eqs.

(16) the displacement of the fixed guided beam yb along its length for a specified distance x from the fixed end is (17) y b = F 12 E I ( 3 l x 2 − 2 x 3 ) The maximum displacement ybmax of the fixed guided beam at the guided end, when x = l will be (18) y b max = F l 3 12 E I The stiffness of the fixed guided beam is given by (19) k b = F o r c e D e f l e c t i o n = 12 E I l 3 = E w t 3   l 3 Where w and t are the width and thickness of the fixed guided beam. As the integrated structure is monolithic and the stiffness of the rigid centre diaphragm is substantially higher than the stiffness of the fixed guided beam, the deflection of the diaphragm y d is transferred as an input to the fixed guided beam. The force F generated on the fixed guided beam at its guided end due to its deflection y b , imposed by the deflection y d of the rigid centre diaphragm under pressure is derived to be y d = y b max = F l 3 12 E I (20) F = 12   E I l 3 y d The stress (σ) generated on the fixed guided beam along its length for a specified distance x from the fixed end is given by [19] (21) σ = F t 2 I l 2 − x Substituting for the generated force F in Eq. (21), the axial stress (σ) and strain (ε) on the fixed guided beam along its length for a specified distance x from the fixed end is derived to be (22) σ = 6   E   t   ( y d )   l 3 l 2 − x (23) ε = 6   t   ( y d )   l 3 l 2 − x Where x is the distance from the fixed end where the secondary sensing element is mounted. The maximum stress generated on the fixed guided beam is tensile at the free end and compressive towards the fixed end of equal magnitudes, as shown by the schematic representation in Fig. 3 (a and b), when the values of x is l or ‘0’, thereby the maximum tensile and compressive strain on the fixed guided beam is given by (24) ε t   max = 3   t   ( y d )   l 2 (25) ε c   max =   − 3   t   ( y d )   l 2 Two FBGs of length lf and diameter df which forms the secondary sensing element is bonded on the maximum tensile and compressive regions of the fixed guided beam as shown in Fig. 1c. The sensing property of FBG is based on the shift in the Bragg wavelength of the FBG (Δλ) which is simultaneously modulated by strain (Δε) and temperature (ΔT) [7,15,16,20] (26) Δ λ =   λ b   1 − p e Δ ε   + α + ζ Δ T Where pe is the effective photoelastic coefficient constant, α is the thermal expansion coefficient and ζ the thermal optic coefficient. The reflected Bragg wavelength   ( λ b ) is given by (27) λ b =   2   η   Λ Where η and Λ are the refractive index of the fiber and the pitch of the grating in the fiber respectively. The shift in Bragg wavelength (λ) is captured by the FBG interrogator and logged using data acquisition system. By interrogating the shift in Bragg wavelength, pressure and temperature can be quantified. The wavelength shift ( Δ λ t and Δ λ c ), experienced by the FBG1 and FBG2 mounted in the tensile and compressive region is given by (28) Δ λ     t λ   t =   1 − p e 3   t   ( y d )   l 2 + α + ζ Δ T (29) Δ λ     c λ   c =   1 − p e − 3   t   ( y d )   l 2 + α + ζ Δ T As the two FGBs are fabricated with identical initial wavelengths of 1525 nm and the initial wavelength is much larger than the wavelength shifts ( Δ λ t , Δ λ c ), λ t and λ c is replaced by an equivalent value ( λ ). Additionally, as the distance between them is small the two FBGs are assumed to undergo the same temperature variation. Hence the difference in wavelength shifts of the two FBGs is a linear function of pressure and independent of temperature, as the temperature effect is nullified as shown in Eq. (31) and k is the pressure sensitivity constant for the structure. In addition, when the wavelength shift difference of the two FBGs is considered as the sensing signal, the pressure sensitivity is increased considerably, compared to using the wavelength shift of a single FBG.

The second step is the mounting of the FBG on to the primary sensing element. The dimensions and properties of the sensor are given in Table 1 .The material 17-4 pH stainless steel is considered for fabrication of the structural element, due to its high chromium content and high strength coupled with good corrosion resistance and excellent toughness, which are very much desirable properties for a pressure sensor as they find usage in corrosive environments. The dimensions of the structure such as the b/a ratio are chosen to ensure linear relation between the applied pressure and deflection of the diaphragm for the entire range of operating pressure. The thickness of the diaphragm and the beam are fixed considering the EDM manufacturing process limitations. The material of diameter 30mm and length 50mm was machined to the designed dimension, the diaphragm and the fixed guided beam were realized by wire cut EDM process and laser welded to the pressure port (M14 × 1.5). Two bare FBG sensors were bonded using adhesive axially in the tensile and compression region of the fixed guided beam, the photograph of the sensor is shown in Fig. 4 (c and d). The sensor was calibrated for a pressure range of 0–20 bar in increment of 4 bar using a dead weight primary standard hydraulic calibrator (Make: FLUKE, Model: P3125-BAR). The FBG interrogator (Make: Micron optics, Model SM130) was used to acquire data, which has the capability to acquire the reflected Bragg wavelength dynamically. The block diagram and the photograph of the calibration setup areas shown in the Fig. 4(a and b). 4 Results and discussion To show the advantages of the rigid centre diaphragm used in the design of the proposed pressure sensor, a comparative study of the pressure-deflection characteristics of the integrated structure with the rigid centre diaphragm and a flat circular diaphragm is carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics. The dimensions and properties of the diaphragm used in the simulation are the same as given in Table 1, designed for a pressure range of 0–20 bar. It is seen that the stiffness brought about by the rigid centre reduces the deflection of the centre diaphragm under load. This makes the response of the rigid centre diaphragm to applied pressure more linear compared to that of the flat diaphragm, but on the other hand decreases the sensitivity. It is observed that a maximum improvement of up to 2.5% in linearity can be achieved, with a 36% reduction in sensitivity. The comparison of the displacement characteristics of the flat and rigid centre diaphragm indicates, smaller the h/a ratio higher is the displacement as indicated in Fig. 5 a.The b/a ratio of the rigid center diaphragm which is another important dimensional ratio affecting the performance characteristics of the primary sensing element shows that a higher b/a ratio decreases the displacement of the diaphragm, as depicted in Fig. 5b. Simulation studies are also carried out on the integrated structure to determine the optimal landing position of the guided end of the fixed guided beam and the stress distribution with respect to the beam position. It is noticed that landing the fixed guided beam eccentric to the centre of the rigid centre diaphragm increases or decreases the tensile/compressive strain accordingly, however by landing the beam at the centre of the diaphragm, higher and equal magnitudes of tensile and compressive strain of∼900 με at 20 bar can be generated as shown in Fig. 6 a. The stiffness for rigid centre diaphragm and fixed guided beam calculated using Eqs. (15) and (19) are 13,338 N/mm and 135 N/mm, which shows that the value of stiffness of the rigid centre diaphragm is substantially higher than that of the fixed guided beam, thereby completely transferring the displacement of the rigid centre diaphragm, induced due to the applied pressure, on to the fixed guided beam. The comparison of analytical and numerical simulation done using COMSOL Multiphysics software also show a close match as seen in the Fig. 6b. The maximum tensile and compressive strain of ∼900 με at 20 bar pressure was observed. The input-output characteristics namely sensitivity, non-linearity, hysteresis and resolution of the pressure sensor are obtained experimentally for a pressure range of 0–20 bar in increments of 4 bar. The results are as shown in Fig. 7 (a–c), conducted using an experimental setup as in Fig. 4(a and b). The sensitivity, non-linearity, hysteresis and resolution were found to be 0.103 nm/bar, 0.0008% full scale deflection (FSD),0.0006% FSD and 0.05 bar as in Fig. 7(a and b).The calculated linearity was found to be 99.94%.The sensor was also tested for repeatability by applying three cycles of ascending and descending pressure and found to have good repeatability as shown in Fig. 7c. The calculated experimental maximum tensile and compressive strain values was 870 με, at 20 bar pressure shows a close match to the obtained simulation and analytical results. In order to evaluate the sensor’s temperature compensation performance, the wavelength shift difference versus the temperature raise at constant pressure has been tested. The fluctuation of wavelength shift is mainly caused by the difference of thermal stress distribution on the surface of the fixed guided beam. A hot and cold chamber (Make: Votch, Model: VCL 7003) is used in our experimentation to vary the temperature of the sensor between 0 °C to 60 °C with a sampling interval of 10 °C. The effect of change in wavelength with respect to temperature change of the two FBG’s are plotted in Fig. 8 a. The differential output of the two FBGs results in nullifying the effect of temperature, as shown in Fig. 8b. The maximum differential value of 0.0067 nm occurring at 50 °C and the sensor’s temperature compensation effect is quite noticeable. It is also observed that sensors sensitivity increases considerably by taking the differential output of both the FBGs as noticed in Eq. (30). The 'k' pressure sensitivity constant of the structure calculated using Eq. (30) is found to be 1.16. The comparison of cumulative analytical and experimental differential output of the sensor shows a close match as in the Fig. 9 . 5 Conclusion A stainless steel FBG based pressure sensor with a rigid centre circular diaphragm and a fixed guided beam landing at its centre,(for a pressure range of 0–20 bar) is designed, fabricated and tested for its performance. In this sensor design, the fixed guided beam is favorably landed on to the rigid centre circular diaphragm so that it produces equal magnitudes of tensile and compressive strain at its free and fixed end, which is captured by the two FBGs to determine the applied pressure. The differential output of the two FBGs nullifies the effect of temperature and also increases the sensitivity of the sensor, in addition the sensor is found to have improvement in linearity as compared to the sensor designed with flat diaphragm. The sensor possess good repeatability and low hysteresis, further the resolution is found to be 0.05 bar. The experimental test results are in close agreement with the results obtained from the analytical model.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.167,Recognition of 25 natural geological samples using a modified correlation analysis method and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopic data,"Abstract The recognition of natural geological samples is of great significance for mineral exploration and geological research. Because of the powerful element analysis ability, the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data was widely used in the classification and recognition of samples in recent two decades. Correlation coefficient, as a classical statistic parameter, reflects the degree of a close correlation between variables, and can be used to compare the LIBS data of test samples with the existing data. But it is difficult to get high accuracy in dealing with the identification problems of natural geological samples, which are usually composed of similar elements and mixed with minor impurity constituents. So, some typical spectral data segments and quantitative features, such as the intensity ratios of elements of LIBS data, are extracted and combined with the correlation coefficient by a specially designed analytical model to identify the geological samples. The modified correlation coefficient method shows a positive improvement in the recognition accuracy, while less complexity than the widely used pattern recognition methods.",Apr-18," Keywords Mineral recognition LIBS The modified correlation analysis Intensity ratios 1 Introduction The recognition of natural geological samples is of great scientific significance for mineral exploration, and geological evolution research on the planets. Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) can detect element composition of samples, and have great advantages in in-situ component analysis application. Some researches on geological samples analysis have been carried out based on LIBS [1–3]. On the other side, the natural geological samples are usually composed of complex elements. Some multivariate analysis methods, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares-Discriminate Analysis (PLS-DA), Soft Independent Modeling Class Analog (SIMCA), and so on, were naturally used to resolve the multivariate analysis problems in these intricate system [4–8]. The combined using of LIBS data and diverse multivariate methods(pattern recognition methods) have showed a good ability in field of component analysis. But unfortunately, the multivariate analysis methods are often too complex to use in for some in-situ application of portable LIBS instrument. This research prefers to find an analysis method with less complexity and small calculation load. As a classical statistic parameter, correlation coefficient reflects the degree of a close correlation between variables. It can be used to compare the detected laser-induced breakdown spectroscopic data of test samples with the existing element LIBS data, and then to identify samples with obvious elemental difference [9–11]. Correlation coefficient is also widely used as one parameter to assess the validity of some processing method, so does in field of LIBS data analysis [12,13]. But the correlation coefficient is difficult to deal with the classification and identification problems directly because of its deficiency in quantitative data. The natural mineral samples are usually composed of similar elements, such as some main diagenetic elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, or mixed with some minor impurity constituents. So, the elements composition and relative contents are vital for the mineral and rock identification. In this paper, some quantitative features of the LIBS data, such as the intensity ratios of spectral lines from different elements, are extracted as an indicator of relative contents and combined with correlation coefficients by an analytical model to identify the minerals. Some preliminary results are presented. 2 Samples and experimental setup A detection system (Fig. 1 ) was set up and used to obtain the LIBS spectra of the samples, detailed description of which has been given before [14]. Only some key information about this system were presented here: a 10ns pulse width and 10 Hz repetition 1064 nm laser (Quantel, Brilliant B) was used as the excitation source. The LIBS signal was collected by a lateral double lens system, went through a Mechelle 5000 spectrograph, and acquired by an iStar DH734i-18F-03 intensified CCD camera (with internal Digital Delay Generator). Using this system, wide spectral range (212 nm–1032 nm) and high resolution (5000@500 nm) LIBS spectrum can be obtained at only one acquisition. Twenty five kinds of natural geological samples were used in this study, which were listed in Table 1 . All samples were broken into little pieces and the sampling points are in the new fracture plane to avoid the environment contamination. In view of the roughness of the samples’ fragmentized surface, careful laser focusing is done for every sampling point, but the fluctuation of the pulsed laser energy and the excited plasma is inevitable. To improve the stability of the LIBS data, the signal Integration On CCD chip (IOC) from 3 pulses excitation and accumulation of 2 spectra in memory were done. That is to say, a single LIBS spectrum was obtained from 6 laser pulses. 3 Methods 3.1 Spectra preprocessing Because of the instabilities of laser pulse energy, the laser focus precision, the heterogeneous component distribution of natural mineral samples, and so on, the spectra of the same mineral are still inconsistent, even though the IOC and accumulation operation during the LIBS data acquisition. To further improve the homogeneity of the spectra, each LIBS data was firstly normalized with its maximum intensity, then the numeric average of the normalized data were made for each kind of geological sample. The LIBS data of natural geological samples were usually redundant for recognition application: First, only part of the LIBS data include effective spectral lines; secondly, only part of the spectral lines are necessary. So, In order to reduce the unnecessary computation and avoid the possible blocking in the program processing from the full LIBS data, the LIBS data were usually condensed by feature extraction operation, for instance, Principal Components Analysis (PCA). But, the extracted PCS are often absence of clear physical meaning. According to the NIST database [15] and the mineral LIBS data obtained from the experiment, some spectral data segments containing typical spectral lines of some usual ore-forming elements like Si, Ca, K, Na, Mg, Al, Ba, Fe, Li, et al. were extracted as the classification features. Fig. 2 shows the main spectral lines of 5 samples: Tektite, Biotite, Albite, Reniform hematite and Anhydrite. The relevant information was listed in Table 2 . By this operation, the dimensions of LIBS data were reduced from 28,243 to 1578. 3.2 Correlation coefficient and the modified method Correlation coefficient reflects the degree of a close correlation between variables, which was based on the product of deviations between two variables and their averaged values. The linear correlation coefficient is calculated using the following formula [9]: (1) r = ∑ ( x i − x ¯ ) ( y i − y ¯ ) ∑ ( x i − x ¯ ) 2 ∑ ( y i − y ¯ ) 2 Here, x and y are two data sets, which may be the full LIBS data or corresponding spectral segments of unknown mineral and foregone mineral. x ¯ and y ¯ are their mean value. Then the value of r can be used to compare the detected LIBS data of test samples with the existing data, and it is a good statistic parameter to indicate whether they have the same components or they are the same kind of mineral, only if x and y containing corresponding spectral features. Most natural geological samples are mixture of complex compositions, usually the main compositions and some kinds of impurities. As for the elements, which are the detection target of LIBS technique, similar elements such as some ore-forming elements like Ca, K, Na, Mg, Al, et al. may exist in different natural geological samples, and even, their distinction could lie in their structure or different content. Another possibilities, the same kind of minerals may contain different elements, for instance, different impurity elements. In a word, the existence and quantity of every elements are vital for identification of natural geological samples. Correlation coefficient method is easy to judge the existence of different elements, but it is difficult to display the elements content information. So, a new parameter m was introduced as a supplement to correlation coefficient. m n can be defined like this, (2) m = M a x [ x i ] M a x [ y i ] In this formula, x i and y i are spectrum segments of 2 LIBS data. Just as mentioned before, the 2 LIBS data were firstly normalized with their own maximum intensity. M a x means get its maximum intensity value in the spectrum segments. Then if x i and y i are from the same kind of mineral, m means the ratio of peak intensity of the same spectral line. And they should have roughly the same elements, nearly the same intensity in corresponding spectrum segment, then m should tend to be 1. If n spectrum segments are featured and extracted from the full LIBS data to recognize an element, a parameter f can be designated to identify this element, and “f” will obtain its minimum value only when x and y are from the same mineral. (3) f = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( r i - 1 ) 2 + 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( m i - 1 ) 2 A database including k elements and their corresponding spectrum segments’ information was needed to set up, and the analytical model as formula (4) can be used to identify the different kinds of minerals: (4) P = ∑ i = 1 K f i 4 Result and analysis One hundred spectra were used for each sample. In view of the fact that the standard spectral data of the natural geography samples play an key role in the analysis models, 20 spectra were averaged as the standard spectral data to get robust standard spectral data, and the last were averaged every 8 spectra and used as a testing set. So, there are 10 test data for each kind of mineral sample. Table 3 gives the comparison of the identification results of modified methods and traditional correlation coefficient (data are shown in the sequence of ‘correlation coefficient /modified methods’) of 25 kinds of minerals (shown in the same sequence number as in Table 1) respectively by the correlation coefficient and modified method presented in this study. Some difference in the classification accuracy can be noticed in Table 3, and the correlation coefficient method has an average accuracy of 94.4% for the 250 validation spectra, while the modified method has a higher accuracy of 96.80%. The classification errors were concentrated in nearly the same kinds of mineral, such as Idocrase (NO. 6), Carbuncle (NO. 8), Magnesite (NO.14), Albite (NO.15), Diopside (NO. 19) and Moonstone (NO. 22) for both the traditional correlation coefficient method and the modified method. So, the similar element components cause the failure of classification, and the introduction of quantitative spectra information in the modified method improves the recognition accuracy. To validate the improvement in accuracy of the modified method, we directly applied the two methods to a group of new samples: white mica, olivine, scoria, desert rose stone, quartzite, fibrous gypsum, which were not used in course of the algorithm research in this paper, and we got a lower classification accuracy of 86.6% and 91.6% respectively for the correlation coefficient method and the modified method. The decreased classification accuracy probably results from the featured spectral segments, which were not so good for these samples. That is to say, more works on feature extraction needed before applying this method to more unknown minerals. But, we have reasons to believe that the modified method has a better classification accuracy than the correlation coefficient method. The SVM (Support Vector Machine) method have shown good performance in terms of classification and recognition application. Here we apply SVM to the same LIBS data from the 25 mineral samples: for every sample, the 20 spectra data were averaged every 2 data and used as the training set, and the rest 80 spectra were averaged every 8 data and used as a testing set. Firstly, the 1578 data extracted as in Table 2 were used to train and test, with the radial basis function as the kernel function, and an averaged classification accuracy of 85.2% was obtained. So, comparing with the modified correlation coefficient method elaborated above, the SVM has a lower accuracy under the similar training set (standard data for the modified method) and testing set. We think it is due to the limited number of training set data. Although it is difficult to judge the performance of the modified correlation coefficient method at present, it shows some accuracy advantages in condition of the limited training data. When the full 28,243 spectra data were used to train and test, the accuracy was only 77.6%, and the computing time was tremendous long because of the huge number of data dimensions. So, the featured data have a higher classification accuracy and less calculation load than the full spectra when using the SVM method, and this result also proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the feature extraction operation presented in this paper. 5 Conclusions This research prefers to find a processing method with less complexity to recognize the mineral samples by their LIBS data. An analytical model, combining the ratios of LIBS spectrum lines intensity of some typical elements with the correlation coefficients of extracted spectral segments, is presented in this research, and some positive improvement in accuracy of mineral classification was obtained comparing to the traditional correlation coefficient method. The contrastive analysis with the SVM method shows that the modified correlation coefficient method may have the advantage of high accuracy in the condition of limited training set, and the advantage of less complexity is promising in the in-situ mineral classification and identify application. As a vital operation in the modified method, feature extraction of LIBS data is preliminarily verified by SVM method, but it also shows some deficiencies in the test to new samples. Improving the adaptability of the LIBS characteristics database is the next step to strengthen the practicality of the modified correlation coefficient method.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.178,A passively Q-switched 1087.2 nm c-cut Nd:YVO4 laser with WS2-based saturable absorber,"Abstract A compact and simple pulsed 1087.2 nm c-cut Nd:YVO4 laser with WS2-based saturable absorber (SA) is reported for the first time. A chosen output-coupled mirror with high-transmission coating at 1066 nm and part-reflection coating at 1087 nm to achieve a high gain at 1087.2 nm and suppress the line at 1066 nm. The highest CW and pulse 1087.2 nm powers are 2314 mW and 608 mW, respectively. The shortest pulse width is only 135 ns.",Apr-18," Keywords WS2 1087.2 nm laser Q-switched Diode-pumped lasers 1 Introduction Pulse near-infrared Nd:YVO4 lasers at 914, 1064, 1066, 1085, 1110 and 1342 nm, which are passively Q-switched by some various SAs, have been paid great attention due to their admirable applications in self-Raman lasers, medical treatments, laser ranging, and producing visible light by frequency doubling technique [1. 2]. Various conventional SAs such as Co2+, V3+ and Cr4+-doped materials, PbS glass and SESAM have been used widely for a very long time, but they are restricted due to narrow absorption-band [1]. Recently, some two-dimensional nano-materials, such as graphene-oxide, graphene, MoS2, WS2, Bi2Se3, WSe2, and black phosphorus, become very novel SAs due to their outstanding broadband operation [2–4]. Among them, WS2 exhibits greater SA performance in higher damage threshold and larger modulation depth [4,5]. Here, we demonstrate a pulsed 1087.2 nm laser with WS2-based SA for the first time. 2 Experimental setup The setup of a 1087.2 nm Nd:YVO4 laser is displayed in Fig. 1 . An 808 LDA is the pump light, which is focused into a c-cut Nd:YVO4 crystal with focusing lens. The length and Nd3+-doped concentration of the crystal are 20 mm and 0.27%, respectively. The 4 cm plane-plane cavity is formed by an input-mirror (Min) with high-transmission (HT) coating at 808 nm and high-reflection (HR) coating at 1087 nm, and an output-coupled mirror (Moc) with HT coating at 1066 nm and part-reflection (PR) coating at 1087 nm. The transmittances of Moc at 1066 and 1087 nm are 89.8% and 11.5%, which can be used to suppress oscillation at 1066 nm and improve gain at 1087 nm, respectively. The 1087 nm laser is passively Q-switched by a WS2− based SA with a transmittance of 88.4% (Fig. 2 ), which is manufactured via a liquid-phase-exfoliated method [2]. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 CW 1087 nm Nd:YVO4 laser The spectrum is detected firstly, when the pump power is changed from 4.15 W to 11.15 W. Only single-wavelength line at 1087.2 nm is found, and other line at 914, 1066, 1085, 1110 or 1342 nm does not emit. According to the spectrum monitored, we can see that the transmittance of Moc at 1066 nm is too large to suppress the oscillation at 1.06 μm. Fig. 3 presents the spectrum at the pump powers of 4.15 and 11.15 W, and the central wavelengths are 1087.15 and 1087.24 nm, respectively. Compare with the traditional oscillation at 1066 nm, the line at 1087.2 nm has a lower emission cross-section, corresponding to the transition of 4F3/2 (R2, 11,391 cm−1) → 4I11/2 (Y6, 2186 cm−1). However, the lower transmittance at 1087 nm of Moc can obtain an admirable gain-coefficient and obtain a single-wavelength line at 1087.2 nm. The threshold of the 1087.2 nm laser is about 4.05 W in Fig.4 . The CW 1087.2 nm power becomes larger and larger with the increase of the 808 nm pump power, and reaches to the largest rate of 2314 mW at the pump power of 11.15 W, corresponding to a conversion-efficient of 20.8%. This CW 1087.2 nm laser is very compact and efficient. 3.2 Pulsed 1087 nm Nd:YVO4 laser In order to achieve a pulsed 1087 nm laser, the WS2-based SA is integrated into the cavity. We obtain a pulsed 1087 nm laser with WS2-based SA for the first time. The pulse train of the pulsed 1087 nm laser at the pump of 11.15 W is shown in Fig. 5 . The threshold and the largest 1087 nm power are 6.95 W and 608 mW in Fig. 4, respectively. The higher threshold and the lower 1087 nm power can be chalked up to the inserting loss of the WS2-based SA. The repetition rate and pulse width of the 1087.2 nm laser are observed in Fig. 6 . When the pump power is changed from 6.96 W to 11.15 W, the repetition rate increases from 60 kHz to 255 kHz and the pulse width decreases from 383 ns to 135 ns. 4 Conclusion We obtain a pulsed 1087.2 nm laser with WS2-based SA for the first time. We employ an output-coupled mirror with HT coating at 1066 nm and PR coating at 1087 nm to achieve a high gain at 1087.2 nm and suppress the line at 1066 nm. The narrowest pulse width and the largest 1087 nm power are 135 ns and 608 mW, respectively. This 1087.2 nm laser can produce visible green light at 543.6 nm by frequency doubling technique.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.207,Luminescent properties of green emitting Tb3+ doped Sr2ZnSi2O7 phosphors,"Abstract This article deals with green-emitting Tb-doped Sr2ZnSi2O7 phosphors. The Sr2ZnSi2O7:Tb3+ phosphor is prepared using the sol-gel method. The structural characterizations of the Sr2ZnSi2O7:Tb3+ phosphors were conducted using the XRPD and SEM analyses. The excitation and emission spectra signified that the phosphor could be effectively excited by a 239-nm ultraviolet excitation, and a green emission that is centered at 543 nm and that corresponds to the 5D4 → 7F5 transition was exhibited. Sound green emissions with the CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.2661, 0.43204) could be achieved. The Sr1.95ZnSi2O7:Tb0.05 powder showed the highest emission intensity for the 239-nm excitation, indicating its potential applicability in the fields of lighting and displays.",Apr-18," Keywords Sol-gel XRPD Tb3+ ions Sr2ZnSi2O7 Photoluminescence 1 Introduction The photoluminescence (PL) that is related to the terbium (Tb) content in different host matrices has attracted significant attention in terms of the green-light emission, which is important in the field of long persistent phosphors, displays, sensors, and solid-state lighting [1–4]. Normally, the Tb3+ ions are preferred as a potential green-emitting dopant for the display of the sharp lines at approximately 543 nm that are attributed to the 5D4–7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4) transitions. The intensity of the Tb3+ absorption peaks, however, is weak, and the excitation band is very narrow due to the forbidden 4f–4f transition [3]. The Tb3+-doped luminescent materials such as La5Si3O12N [3], La0.6Y0.4PO4 [5], Ba3LaK(PO4)3F [6], NaLi2PO4 [7], and Ca2PO4Cl [8] have been studied by researchers because of their great optical performances. In general, the crystal structure of the host matrix is responsible for the luminescent performance of phosphors. The crucial part is the selection of the best possible host matrix. Recently, alkaline earth silicates have been reported as suitable materials for the lamp industry, and especially Sr2ZnSi2O7 [9–12]. This silicate possesses a tetragonal akermanite-type structure with the space group P 4 - 21m (no. 113) [13], and it contains discrete (Si2O7)6− units that are formed by two corner-sharing silicate (SiO4) tetrahedrals. The zinc (Zn) atoms lie in the tetrahedral that is formed by oxygen (O) atoms, while the tetrahedral of the Sr2+ cations is capable of an eight-fold O coordination [14]. In this article, Sr2ZnSi2O7 was selected as the host matrix because of its excellent luminescent performance. Earlier, it was prepared using the conventional solid-state method, but it is difficult to reduce the synthesis cost and time when this method is employed. Here, an attempt is made to prepare Tb-doped, high-quality Sr2ZnSi2O7 phosphors using a simple method (i.e., the sol-gel method). The effects of the Tb3+ ions on the photoluminescent properties of the Sr2ZnSi2O7:Tb3+ phosphors have been reported. This silicate phosphor could be an alternative green-emitting phosphor for the lighting and displays fields. 2 Experimental A series of Sr 2-x ZnSi2O7:Tb x (x = 0.01 ≤ x ≤ 0.11) samples were prepared via a citrate sol-gel method. High-purity-grade Sr(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2∙6H2O, SiO2, citric acid, and Tb(NO3)3∙5H2O were used for the synthesis. The details of the sample composition and the starting materials are given in Table 1 . The stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials were dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water, and the citric acid (citric acid/metal ion = 2:1; molar ratio) was added with stirring to obtain a transparent solution. The citric acid served as a complexing/chelating agent while the stirring lasted for approximately 1 h to make a completely homogeneous solution of all of the reactants. The obtained transparent aqueous solution was kept in an oven at 110 °C for 12 h to produce a dried gel, and then the obtained dried gel was preheated in a furnace at 400 °C for 2 h. Lastly, the samples were grinded and sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h to obtain the final samples. A number of complementary methods were used to characterize the prepared phosphors. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns of the samples were recorded using the Rigaku Miniflex-II diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) playing the role of the X-ray source. The XRPD patterns were taken at a scan rate of 5°/minute in the 2θ range of 10–80°. The morphology details were obtained using the Hitachi S-3400 scanning electron microscope (SEM) from Hitachi, Japan. The photoluminescent measurements were carried out at room temperature on the Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) that had been equipped with a xenon-flash lamp. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure and crystallite -size analysis Fig. 1 shows the XRPD patterns of the series of the Sr 2-x ZnSi2O7:Tb x (x = 0.01 ≤  x ≤ 0.11) samples. All of the notable peaks are in sound agreement with the pattern of the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards for Sr2ZnSi2O7 (International Centre for Diffraction Data [JCPDS] Card No-39-0235), thereby confirming a tetragonal structure [14]. From the XRPD pattern, it can be confirmed that the incorporation of the Tb ion into the Sr2ZnSi2O7 host lattice does not significantly alter the host structure (i.e., when the Sr2+ is replaced by the Tb3+, the crystal structure of the Sr2ZnSi2O7:Tb3+ phosphors remains unchanged). Although, a number of extra weak peaks (♦), which may belong to Sr2SiO4 and were formed during the synthesis, are present. Also, at the higher Tb3+ concentrations, the quantity of the additional peak intensities was increased. The Scherrer formula was then applied to calculate the crystallite size, as follows: (1) D = 0.9 λ/β cos θ, where λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray, θ is the corresponding Bragg-diffraction angle, and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (211) peak. The calculated crystallite size is in the region of 34–44 nm. The crystallite sizes and the FWHM values for all of the samples are given in Table 2 . 3.2 SEM analysis Fig. 2 shows the SEM morphologies of the Sr1.95ZnSi2O7:Tb0.05 phosphor, wherein it is evident that the powder was aggregated; this aggregation is owing to the high-temperature (1000 °C) annealing that increased the sizes of the phosphor particles, thereby making them highly vulnerable to agglomeration. The SEM images exhibit sponge-like agglomerated microcrystalline powders. The particle shapes are not regular, while the larger particles were formed from the agglomeration and the adhesion of the smaller particles, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). It is difficult to control the aggregation of particles at higher temperatures because it is possible to observe highly aggregated particles in SEM images, and the highly agglomerated nature of particles makes it impossible to determine the exact particles sizes from SEM images. The formation of the smaller particles, however, can be seen in higher-magnification SEM images, and this is demonstrated in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The present study reveals that the excellent luminescent properties of the microcrystalline powder enhance the ability to find more corresponding applications [15–17]. 3.3 PL analysis The PL spectra of the Sr2- x ZnSi2O7:Tb x (x = 0.01 ≤ x  ≤  0.11) phosphors are presented in Fig. 3 . The PL-excitation spectra that are shown in Fig. 3(a) and were monitored at 543 nm reveal the maximum excitation peak at ∼239 nm. The spectra can be distinguished into different excitation bands, which are composed of two major bands, both of which are in the ultraviolet (UV) range, as follows: a band centered at ∼239 nm and a band centered at ∼ 280 nm. These observed bands at ∼239 nm and ∼280 nm are due to the spin-allowed and spin-forbidden 4f8–4f75d1 transitions of the Tb3+, respectively [18], and the latter peaks could be attributed to the forbidden Tb3+ 4f–4f transitions; that is, at ∼ 317 nm (7F6 → 5H7), at ∼ 351 nm (7F6 → 5D2), and at 377 nm (7F6 → 5G6) [19]. The former-band excitation intensity of ∼239 nm is much higher than that of the latter band; therefore, it has been chosen for further investigation. Fig. 3(b) shows the PL-emission spectra for the series of the Sr2- x ZnSi2O7:Tb x (x = 0.01 ≤  x ≤ 0.11) phosphor. The most pronounced emission band at ∼543 nm is due to the 5D4 → 7F5 transition that shows a bright-green emission, and it comprises the strongest intensity and the highest probability of the electric-dipole transition [20]. All of the prepared samples with the different Tb3+ concentrations exhibited similar emission peaks with the exception of the intensity values. The transitions of 5D3 or 5D4 to 7FJ produce a wide coverage emission between 360 nm and 620 nm. The peaks that are centered at ∼384, ∼415, ∼435, and ∼469 nm are from the 5D3–7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions [7], while the peaks that are centered at ∼492, ∼543, ∼582, and ∼622 nm are due to the 4f–4f transitions from 5D 4 to 7F J (J  = 6, 5, 4, 3) [7]. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show photographs of the Sr1.95ZnSi2O7:Tb0.05-phosphor powders that were prepared using the sol-gel method under room light and UV radiation (254 nm), respectively. The Sr1.95 ZnSi2O7:Tb0.05-phosphor emits green light under a UV source. The relative emission intensities show a trend that is similar to the increasing of the Tb3+-doping concentration (i.e., with the increasing of the Tb3+ concentration, the emission intensity of the Sr2- x ZnSi2O7:Tb x [x = 0.01 ≤ x ≤ 0.11] phosphors initially increased and reached a maximum at x = 0.05, but then it decreased due to the concentration quenching), as shown in Fig. 5 . The concentration quenching is mainly caused by the energy transfer from one activator to another that is in consideration of the Sr2ZnSi2O7:Tb3+ multipolar interaction [21]. Fig. 6 shows the Commission Internationale de l´ Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram for the Sr2- x ZnSi2O7:Tb x (x = 0.01 ≤ x ≤ 0.11) phosphor that has been excited at 239 nm. All of the results that were calculated from the spectra and that are shown in Fig. 3 are plotted in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram, as can be seen in Fig. 6. The CIE color coordinates for the Sr2- x ZnSi2O7:Tb x (x = 0.01 ≤ x ≤ 0.11) phosphor are given in Table 3 . It has been reported that an adjustment of the Tb3+-doping concentration in the phosphors can significantly tune a variety of the emission colors from blue to green. In the present case, a warm white emission was achieved since the emission lines of the Tb3+ in the Sr2ZnSi2O7 phosphor cover the almost-whole visible region. The increased Tb3+ concentration induced the emission colors to shift from the blue to the green region. This fundamental work might be important in the ongoing development of new luminescent devices, making it applicable for the green phosphors of the lamp industry; furthermore, it could be helpful in the development of a phosphor-based generator that produces white light with a particular ratio. 4 Conclusions A series of the Sr2- x ZnSi2O7:Tb x (x = 0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.11) phosphor was successfully prepared via the sol-gel method. The XRPD study revealed that crystals of a tetragonal structure were formed. The SEM results revealed that the powdered-phosphor shapes are irregular. Most of the bigger particles were formed by the adhesion of the smaller particles. The phosphor, with a single excitation band at 239 nm, could be efficiently excited by UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and it is believed that it could be a promising green-emitting phosphor for the lamp industry. The strong emission peak that is centered at 543 nm is the most favorable for the attainment of a phosphor with a high color purity. The excitation and emission intensities increased with the addition of Tb3+ content, and the maximum intensity was obtained for the Sr1.95ZnSi2O7:Tb0.05 sample.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.152,Two color laser self focusing and terahertz generation in multi-ion species plasma,"Abstract An analytical formalism of self focusing of two co-propagating laser beams, fundamental ω 1 and close to second harmonic ω 2 ≈ 2 ω 1 , in a multi-ion species plasma and resonant terahertz radiation generation has been developed. The nonlinearity arises due to ponderomotive force on electrons by both the beams and subsequent ambipolar redistribution of the plasma. The ions of higher charged state are strongly depleted from the axial region due to space charge field effects and electron charge is largely compensated by the ions of lower charge. When the power of the strong beam equals the critical power for its self-guiding, the plasma provides an oscillatory waveguide for the weak beam; the weak beam shrinks and rebounds when its frequency is lower than that of the strong beam, and it swallows and rebounds when the frequency is higher. When both beams are strong the nonlinearities have cumulative effect on both the beams. The cross coupling of the beams gives rise to nonlinear current giving rise to terahertz radiation at ω = ω 2 − 2 ω 1 frequency. An axial density ripple aids phase matching and gives rise to higher power conversion efficiency. Self focusing leads to enhancement in conversion efficiency.",Apr-18," Keywords Laser plasma interaction Cross focusing Terahertz generation 1 Introduction Self focusing is an important issue in high power laser plasma interaction. It plays significant role in inertial confinement fusion [1–3], laser driven charged particle acceleration [4,5] and other applications [6–8]. In long pulse experiments nonlinearity for self-focusing arises through the ponderomotive force induced ambipolar diffusion of plasma and subsequent density depression in regions of higher intensity [9,10]. In the steady state in a single ion species plasma to which most theories of self focusing are restricted, the modified electron density goes as n e = n 0 exp − β 0 I / ω 2 where n 0 is the equilibrium electron density, I and ω are the intensity and frequency of the laser, and β 0 is a constant dependent on electron and ion temperature. For a Gaussian beam, this translates into axial part of the wavefront propagating with smaller phase velocity than the marginal rays and wavefront acquiring curvature, leading to self focusing. In collisional plasma, nonlinearity arises through Ohmic heating of electrons and subsequent ambipolar redistribution of plasma density [11,12]. This occurs on the time scale of temperature relaxation time which is orders of magnitude longer than a collision time. For short pulses, shorter than the ion response time, the nonlinearity arises through the combined effects of relativistic mass variation and ponderomotive force induced electron density modification [10,13]. Andreev et al. [14] have studied ponderomotive self focusing of a laser pulse of duration comparable to ambipolar diffusion time and studied its coupling to stimulated Brillouin backscattering. They observe periodic bursts of scattered radiation. The treatment, however, is limited to fractional change in electron density δ n / n 0 < < 1 . In experiments on self modulated laser wakefield acceleration, a plasma wave perturbation causes periodic focusing of the laser which in turn exerts a periodic ponderomotive force on electrons, driving the plasma wave [15,16]. Ions are practically immobile in these situations. The analytical studies are limited to density modifications being small; however, numerical studies are valid for arbitrary density modifications. In laser wakefield acceleration one encounters quasistatic relativistic and ponderomotive self focusing [17–19]. In laser beat wave accelerator, one encounters simultaneous propagation of two high power laser beams. The nonlinearity is a cumulative effect of the two beams and both the beams influence self focusing of each other. When the beat frequency is close to plasma frequency, ω = ω 1 − ω 2 ∼ ω p , the beat frequency ponderomotive force F → p ω gives rise to large amplitude plasma wave and the latter has significant influence on cross focusing of the beams. Kalmykov et al. [20] have shown that the beam focusing is enhanced for Ω < ω p and suppressed for Ω > ω p . Sprangle et al. [21,22] have analyzed that in partially stripped plasmas, bound electrons significantly enhances the forward Raman instability and filamentation instability. However, our treatment is limited to pre-existing plasmas with fully electron stripped ions, e.g. CH plasma. In multi ion species plasmas, the process of ambipolar diffusion poses complications as the stochiometry of composition (the ratio of densities of different ion species) is not conserved. The space charge field, produced due to the displacement of electrons under ponderomotive force, pushes ions of higher charge with stronger force, hence disturbs the relative composition. Shikha et al. [23] have developed a theoretical formalism of self focusing of a Gaussian electromagnetic beam in a multi-ion species plasma. They invoke a technique to evaluate the density redistribution on different ion species under the approximation of quasi neutrality. However, the electron density is governed by a transcendental equation that at high intensity is to be solved numerically. Xie et al. [24] have experimentally observed THz radiation in air by nonlinear mixing of two color laser, choosing two coaxial laser beams of frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 such that ω 2 − 2 ω 1 falls in the terahertz range. Kumar [25] has developed an analytical theory for this experiment, ignoring the effect of self focusing and considering a plasma of single ion species. Recently, Vvedenskii et al. [26] have investigated low frequency THz emission in the experiment with the ambient air ionized by a two color femtosecond laser pulse. Liu et al. [27] have studied cross phase modulation of two short pulse lasers including the effect of self focusing in a plasma, however, ion dynamics is taken to be frozen. Kumar et al. [28] have investigated the self focusing/defocusing of a relativistic laser pulse in a multiple-ionizing gas but ignored the redistribution of ions. In this paper we address the issue of self focusing and THz radiation generation of two color laser in two ion species plasma, e.g. CH plasma, or hydrogen embedded helium plasma or helium plasma with singly and doubly ionized ions. Two coaxial laser beams of frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 , propagating through a pre-existing plasma, exert cumulative ponderomotive force on electrons and cause ambipolar diffusion of plasma. We bring out specific cases where modified electron density is expressible in terms of cumulative ponderomotive potential. At high intensity, we note that the ion species of higher charge flushes out almost completely from the paraxial region and quasi neutrality is maintained by the balance of densities of lower charge ions with electrons. In this case nonlinear plasma permittivity turns out to have exponential dependence on the intensities of lasers. 2 Nonlinear permittivity Consider a plasma comprising two ion species of densities n 10 (of charge Z 1 e ) and n 20 (of charge Z 2 e ) and temperature T i and electrons of density n 0 0 and temperature T e . Quasi-neutrality demands, (1) n 0 0 = Z 1 n 10 + Z 2 n 20 Two Gaussian laser beams propagate through the plasma, (2) E → j = x ˆ A j ( r , z ) exp [ − i ( ω j t − k j z ) ] , A j | z = 0 2 = A j00 2 exp ( − r 2 / r 0 2 ) , j = 1 , 2 where k j = ( ω j / c ) ( ε j 0 0 ) 1 / 2 , ε j 0 0 = 1 − ω p 2 / ω j 2 , ω p = n 0 0 e 2 / m ε 0 1 / 2 is the unmodified plasma frequency, and − e and m are the electronic charge and mass of the electrons and ε 0 is the free space permittivity. For z > 0 , assuming paraxial ray approximation, the energy conserving Gaussian intensity profiles are, (3) A j 2 = A j 00 2 f j 2 exp − r 2 / r 0 2 f j 2 , j = 1 , 2 where f 1 , f 2 are the beam width parameters. This approximation would fail had the two laser frequencies differed by plasma frequency ( ω 1 − ω 2 = ω p ) as in that case an electron plasma wave is excited that leads to energy transfer from one beam to the other. The lasers impart oscillatory velocities to electrons v → j = e E → j / m i ω j , and exert a time average ponderomotive force on them F → p = e ∇ φ p (4) φ p = − e 4 m A 1 2 ω 1 2 + A 2 2 ω 2 2 The ponderomotive force also has a beat frequency component, however for ω 2 − ω 1 > > ω p its influence on ion density redistribution is small. The static ponderomotive force displaces the electrons radially outward, creating a space charge field E → s = − ∇ φ s , that pulls the ions along. In the steady state, the equation of motion for electrons and two ion species give 0 = − e E → s + F → p − T e / n e ∇ n e 0 = Z 1 e E → s − T i / n 1 i ∇ n 1 i (5) 0 = Z 2 e E → s − T i / n 2 i ∇ n 2 i where n e = Z 1 n 1 i + Z 2 n 2 i . In writing Eqs. (5), the contribution from ponderomotive force on ion has been ignored due to their large masses. Eliminating e E → s from Eqs. (5) and integrating the resulting equation under the condition that at r → ∞ , φ p → 0 , n 1 i = n 10 , n 2 i = n 20 and n e = n 0 0 , one obtains (6) n 1 i n 10 = n e n 0 0 − Z 1 T e / T i P Z 1 (7) n 2 i n 20 = n e n 0 0 − Z 2 T e / T i P Z 2 where P = exp − e φ p / T i , One may note that (8) n 2 i n 20 = n 1 i n 10 Z 2 / Z 1 The relative density reduction of the higher charged state is greater than that of the smaller charged state. The reason is that the space charge force on ions of higher charge is stronger. Using Eqs. (6) and (7), and employing the condition for charge quasi neutrality, one obtains, (9) n e n 0 0 = Z 1 n 10 n 0 0 n e n 0 0 − Z 1 T e / T i exp − Z 1 e φ p T i + Z 2 n 20 n 0 0 n e n 0 0 − Z 2 T e / T i exp − Z 2 e φ p T i We solve it in different cases. a) Weak Nonlinearity Approximation In the weak nonlinearity approximations, one may solve Eq. (9) by expanding n e as n e = n 0 0 + Δ n e , Δ n e < < n 0 0 , Then Eq. (9) yields (10) Δ n e n 0 0 = β e φ p / T i 1 + β T e / T i where β = n 10 Z 1 2 + n 20 Z 2 2 / n 0 0 . b) Isothermal Plasma ( T e = T i ) with Z 1 = 1 , Z 2 = 2 (e.g., helium plasma embedded with deuterium or hydrogen) In this case, Eq. (9) takes the form of a cubic (11) n e n 0 0 3 − n 10 n 0 0 n e n 0 0 P − 2 n 20 n 0 0 P 2 = 0 with roots n e n 0 0 = n 20 n 0 0 P 2 + n 20 2 n 0 0 2 P 4 − 1 27 n 10 n 0 0 P 3 1 / 3 + n 20 n 0 0 P 2 − n 20 2 n 0 0 2 P 4 − 1 27 n 10 n 0 0 P 3 1 / 3 c) Isothermal Plasma with Z 1 = 1 and Z 2 = 3 In this case, Eq. (9) becomes bi-quadratic giving (12) n e n 0 0 = P 2 n 10 n 0 0 + n 10 2 n 0 0 2 + 12 n 20 n 0 0 P 1 / 2 d) High Intensity Limit ( P ≤ .5 ) For T e / T i > 1 and Z 2 > Z 1 , when P ≅ exp − e φ p / T i ≤ 0.5 , one may ignore the last term in Eq. (9), giving (13) n e n 0 0 ≈ n 10 n 0 0 T i / Z 1 T e + T i exp e φ p / Z 1 T e + T i For T e / T i ≥ 4 , the first factor on the right is of the order of 1, hence one may write (14) n e = n 0 0 exp − e 2 4 m Z 1 T e + T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 2 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 2 In all these cases, n e has implicit dependence on r through P or A 1 2 and A 2 2 . One may express n e in the paraxial region as n e = n e 0 + n 2 ( r 2 / r 0 2 ) where n e 0 = n e ( r = 0 ) and (15) n 2 = ∂ n e ∂ P ∂ P ∂ r 2 r = 0 r 0 2 For cases (a) and (d), one may explicitly write n e 0 = n 0 0 + β e φ p ( 0 ) / T i 1 + β T e / T i = n 0 0 − β e 2 4 m β T e + T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 2 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 2 (16) n 2 = β e 2 4 m β T e + T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 4 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 4 n e 0 = n 0 0 exp − e 2 4 m Z 1 T e + T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 2 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 2 (17) n 2 = n e 0 e 2 4 m Z 1 T e + T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 4 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 4 For other cases n e 0 and n 2 can be obtained from Eq. (11) to (12) when the need arises. In the presence of the laser beams, the plasma permittivity at ω 1 and ω 2 can be written as (18) ε j ω j = ε j 0 + φ j A 1 , A 2 where φ j = − ω p 2 ω j 2 n e − n 0 0 n 0 0 , represents the contribution due to nonlinear effects. In the case of weak nonlinearity (19) φ j = β e 2 4 m T i + β T e ω p 2 ω j 2 A 1 2 ω 1 2 + A 2 2 ω 2 2 At high intensity, (20) ε j ω j = 1 − ω p 2 ω j 2 − ω p 2 ω j 2 n e n 0 0 = ε j s − ε j 2 r 2 / r 0 2 , j = 1 , 2 ε j s = 1 − ω p 2 / ω j 2 n e 0 / n 0 0 , ε j 2 = ω p 2 / ω j 2 n 2 / n 0 0 3 Cross focusing under weak nonlinearity The wave equation governing the propagation of the laser beam is (21) ∇ 2 E → + ω 2 c 2 ε E → = 0 Substituting for E → from Eq. (2) and using WKB approximation (neglecting the term ∂ 2 A / ∂ z 2 assuming A ( r , z ) to be a slowly varying function of z), Eq. (21) takes the form (22) 2 i k j ∂ A j ∂ z + ∇ ⊥ 2 A j − ω 2 c 2 φ j A j = 0 We write A j = A j 0 ( r , z ) exp ( i k j S j ) , where A j 0 and S j are real functions of r and z , and separate out the real and imaginary parts of Eq. (22), (23) ∂ A j 2 ∂ z + ∇ ⊥ 2 S j A j 2 + ∂ S j ∂ r ∂ A j 2 ∂ r = 0 (24) 2 ∂ S j ∂ z + ∂ S j ∂ r 2 − φ j ε j 0 = 1 k j 2 A j ∇ ⊥ 2 A j We expand the eikonal S in the paraxial ray approximation as (25) S j = S j 0 ( z ) + S j 2 ( z ) r 2 2 ; j = 1 , 2 and introduce function f j ( z ) such that (26) S j 2 = 1 f j d f j d z where S j 0 z is arbitrary and f j is the beam width parameter for slowly converging/diverging fields. Using these in Eq. (23), one obtains the solution for A j 2 given by Eq. (3) exactly. Using Eqs. (3), (25) and (26) in Eq. (24) and collecting the coefficients of r 2 on both sides, we obtain the equations governing with the beam width parameters d 2 f 1 d ξ 2 = 1 f 1 3 − r 0 2 ω p 2 c 2 e 2 4 m T i β 1 + β T e / T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 4 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 4 f 1 (27) d 2 f 2 d ξ 2 = k 1 k 2 2 1 f 2 3 − ω 1 2 ω 2 2 r 0 2 ω p 2 c 2 e 2 4 m T i β 1 + β T e / T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 4 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 4 f 2 where ξ = z / R d 1 , R d 1 = k 1 r 0 2 , ( r 0 ω p / c ) = ( r 0 ω 1 / c ) Z 1 n 01 / n c r + Z 2 n 02 / n c r 1 / 2 and n c r = m ε 0 ω 1 2 / e 2 . The first terms on the right-hand-side of these equations represent diffraction due to divergence. The second terms represent focusing due to ponderomotive nonlinearity. In the case when power of the second beam is lower than that of the first beam, the nonlinearity in permittivity arises only due to the first beam. In this case, A 200 2 terms in Eqs. (27) can be dropped, Under a special case when r 0 2 ω p 2 c 2 e 2 A 1 2 4 m ω 1 2 β β T e + T i = 1 i.e., when the diffraction term for the first beam is exactly balanced by the self focusing term, the first beam (with plane wavefront) propagates without convergence or divergence, the beam width parameter of the second beam (having d f 2 / d z = 0 at z = 0 ) turns out to be (28) f 2 2 = 1 + α 1 sin 2 ω 1 ω 2 k 1 k 2 ξ where α 1 = ω 2 2 ω 1 2 − 1 . For ω 2 > ω 1 , α 1 is positive and f 2 varies in a space periodic manner between 1 and 1 + α 1 1 / 2 . It undergoes divergence (due to predominance of diffraction) acquiring a maximum f 2 = ω 2 / ω 1 and then falls of due to predominance of self focusing. For ω 2 < ω 1 , the trend is opposite, f 2 varies between 1 and 1 − α 1 1 / 2 . For the general case, when both beams are strong, we have solved Eqs. (27) numerically with appropriate initial boundary conditions, at z = 0 , f 1 , f 2 = 1 and d f 1 / d z , d f 2 / d z = 0 . Fig. 1 shows the variation of the beam width parameter f 1 , 2 as a function of normalized distance of propagation ξ for the following set of parameters r 0 ω 1 / c = 65 , n 01 / n c r = 0.02 , n 02 / n c r = 0.01 , n 01/n 02 = 2, T e / T i = 2.9 , ω 1 / ω 2 = 0.5 , k 1 / k 2 = 0.5 , A 200 / A 100 = 2 , e 2 A 2 100/4mTiω2 1 = 0.3 (corresponds to laser intensity of 5 × 10 14 W/cm2 for T i = 100 e V ). Solid curve represents Z 1 = 1 , Z 2 = 2 (i.e. hydrogen embedded helium plasma) and dashed curves represents Z 1 = 1 , Z 2 = 6 (i.e. CH plasma). The self focusing of the first beam is stronger than the second beam when ω2 >ω1 . For higher charged state, both the beams gets self focused earlier than the lower charged state. However, this is valid up to a distance of ξ = 0.2 beyond which the weak nonlinearity approximation fails. 4 Cross focusing under strong nonlinearity In this case the nonlinear permittivity can be expanded in powers of r 2 (in the paraxial region) as (29) φ j = ω p 2 ω j 2 n e 0 − n 0 0 n 0 0 + ω p 2 ω j 2 n 2 r 2 r 0 2 n 2 = ∂ n e ∂ P ∂ P ∂ r 2 r = 0 r 0 2 (30) n 2 = n e 0 e 2 4 m Z 1 T e + T i A 100 2 ω 1 2 f 1 4 + A 200 2 ω 2 2 f 2 4 With this expression for φ j , Eq. (19) can be solved in the same way as in section III. The resulting equations for the beam width parameters f 1 , f 2 are d 2 f 1 d ξ 2 = 1 f 1 3 − r 0 2 ω p 2 c 2 I 10 1 f 1 4 + ω 1 2 A 200 2 / ω 2 2 A 100 2 f 2 4 exp − I 10 1 f 1 2 + ω 1 2 A 200 2 / ω 2 2 A 100 2 f 2 2 f 1 (31) d 2 f 2 d ξ 2 = k 1 2 k 2 2 f 2 3 − k 1 2 k 2 2 r 0 2 ω p 2 c 2 I 10 1 f 1 4 + ω 1 2 A 200 2 / ω 2 2 A 100 2 f 2 4 exp − I 10 1 f 1 2 + ω 1 2 A 200 2 / ω 2 2 A 100 2 f 2 2 f 2 where ξ = z / R d 1 , I 10 = e 2 A 100 2 / 4 m ω 1 2 ( Z 1 T e + T i ) , and the value of r 0 ω p / c is expressible in terms of r 0 ω 1 / c as given after Eq. (27). We have solved Eq. (31) numerically for initially plane wavefronts. Fig. 2 shows the variation of beam width parameters f 1 , 2 as a function of normalized distance of propagation ξ for r 0 ω 1 / c = 65 , n 01 / n c r = 0.02 , n 02 / n c r = 0.01 , ω 1 / ω 2 = 0.5 , k 1 / k 2 = 0.5 , A 200 / A 100 = 2 , e 2 A 100 2 / 4 m ω 1 2 ( Z 1 T e + T i ) = 0.3 . Solid curves represent Z 1 = 1 , Z 2 = 2 (hydrogen embedded helium plasma) and dashed curves represent Z 1 = 1 , Z 2 = 6 (CH plasma). One notices that both the beams get self focused when ω 2 > ω 1 . The self focusing for the first beam takes place earlier and is stronger than the second beam. For higher charged state i.e. Z 2 = 6 , both the beams gets self focused earlier than the lower charged state i.e. Z 2 = 2 . It means self focusing in a CH plasma will take place earlier in comparison to hydrogen embedded helium plasma. The reason is that the ions of higher charged state are strongly pushed out from the axial region. 5 Terahertz generation The two Gaussian laser beams also exert time varying ponderomotive force on electrons that drives density oscillations, which when beat with electron oscillatory velocities, give rise to nonlinear current producing THz radiation. We allow a density ripple in the plasma (32) n 0 0 = n 0 ∗ + n q 0 e i q z The relevant components of ponderomotive force that contribute to THz generation at ω = ω 2 − 2 ω 1 are F → p 2 ω 1 = − i m v → 1 . v → 1 2 k → 1 (33) F → p ω 2 − ω 1 = − i m v → 2 . v → 1 ∗ 2 k → 2 − k → 1 These components of ponderomotive force impart oscillatory velocities to electrons (34) v → ω 2 − ω 1 = − F → p ( ω 2 − ω 1 ) i m ( ω 2 − ω 1 ) and produce density perturbations n 2 ω 1 , n ω 2 − ω 1 at wave vectors 2 k 1 − q and k 2 − k − q (35) n 2 ω 1 = − n q ∗ v → 1 . v → 1 8 ω 1 2 ε ( 2 ω 1 ) k 1 2 (36) n ω 2 − ω 1 = − n q ∗ v → 2 . v → 1 ∗ ( k 2 − k 1 ) 2 4 ( ω 2 − ω 1 ) 2 ε ( ω 2 − ω 1 ) where ε ( 2 ω 1 ) = 1 − ω p 2 / 4 ω 1 2 and ε ( ω 2 − ω 1 ) = 1 − ω p 2 / ( ω 2 − ω 1 ) 2 appear due to the self consistent space charge field produced by the density perturbations n 2 ω 1 , n ω 2 − ω 1 . For ω 1 > > ω p , ε ( 2 ω 1 ) ≈ 1 , ε ( ω 2 − ω 1 ) ≈ 1 . The density perturbations beat with the oscillatory velocities and yield a nonlinear current density at ω = ω 2 − 2 ω 1 , J → ω N L = − 1 2 n 2 ω 1 ∗ e v → ω 2 − 1 2 n ω 2 − ω 1 e v → ω 1 ∗ (37) = n q ∗ e k 1 2 16 ω 1 2 v → 1 ∗ . v → 1 ∗ v → 2 + n q ∗ e k 2 − k 1 2 8 ω 2 − ω 1 2 v → 2 . v → 1 ∗ v → 1 ∗ Since ω 2 − ω 1 ≈ ω 1 , k 2 − k 1 ≈ k 1 , and v → 2 v → 1 x ˆ , Eq. (37) can be written as (38) J → ω N L = − 3 n q ∗ e 4 k 1 2 E → 1 ∗ . E → 1 ∗ 16 i m 3 ω 1 4 ω 2 E → 2 This current density is perpendicular to the direction of laser propagation, hence ∇ × J → ω N L ≠ 0 . It gives rise to the generation of electromagnetic THz radiation. The terahertz field E → ω , in turn produces self consistent (linear) current density (39) J → ω L = − n 0 0 e 2 m i ω E → ω The wave equation governing E → ω is (40) − ∇ ( ∇ .

Writing E → ω = x ˆ A e − i ω t − k z and assuming ∂ / ∂ z E ω > ∂ / ∂ r E ω , we obtain (41) 2 i k ∂ A ∂ z ≈ ω ε 0 c 2 3 n q ∗ e 4 k 1 2 A 1 2 A 2 16 n 0 0 m 3 ω 1 4 ω 2 In the paraxial region, in compliance with Eq. (3) one may write A = A 0 exp − r 2 r 0 2 2 f 1 2 + 1 f 2 2 Using above in Eq. (41), one obtains (42) ∂ A 0 ∂ z = − i 3 n q 0 32 n 0 0 ω p 2 ω 2 c ( 1 − ω p 2 / ω 2 ) 1 / 2 ( e A 100 m ω 1 c ) 2 A 200 f 1 2 f 2 We solved Eq. (42) numerically in conjunction with the equations governing f 1 , f 2 for the following parameters: e 2 A 100 2 / 4 m ω 1 2 T e = 0.3 , v t h / c = 0.1 , r 0 ω 1 / c = 65 , n q 0 / n 0 0 = 0.2 , ω p / ω = 0.5 , ω 2 / ω 1 = 2 , k 2 / k 1 = 2 . We have plotted in Figs. 3 and 4 , normalized amplitude A 0 / A 200 as a function of normalized distance ξ = z / R d 1 in the case of strong and weak nonlinearities for hydrogen embedded helium plasma and CH plasma. The amplitude rises steadily. As the beams get self focused, terahertz amplitude rises sharply. 6 Conclusions The self focusing of two color laser in multi ion species plasma is sensitive to the composition of charge states of ions. The beam of higher frequency undergoes slower self focusing as the nonlinear plasma susceptibility decreases with wave frequency. The ion species of higher charge moves out of the paraxial region more rapidly leaving behind depressed density electrons and smaller charge ions. Thus the self focusing of beams takes place earlier for higher charged state than the lower charged state. In the case of laser produced plasma with T e ≥ 4 T i , e φ p ≥ T e , the higher charge species are almost completely pushed out of the axial region offering an analytical expression for nonlinear plasma permittivity. The saturation effect of nonlinearity manifests itself in periodic focusing of the beams. Self focusing has a strong effect on two color laser THz excitation. The presence of a density ripple helps achieve phase matching, making THz generation as a resonant third order nonlinear process. The terahertz amplitude rises with distance. As the beams undergo self focusing and their axial intensities rise, the THz amplitude rises rapidly. It slows down around the minima in beam width parameters. Here we have neglected the contributions of bound electrons to plasma permittivity which is justified when the laser frequency is much lower than the frequency of revolution of bound electrons. We have also neglected the dynamical change of states of ionization, hence the treatment is limited to pre-existing plasmas with fully electron stripped ions, e.g., CH plasma. The laser pulse considered here are longer than the ion response time r 0 / c s where c s is the sound speed. For r 0 ∼ 2 μ m , c s ∼ 10 7 c m / s , it corresponds to 20 ps. The assumption of Gaussian ansatz may not be applicable beyond a few Rayleigh lengths. The neglect of collisions implies that the absorption coefficient k i < R d 1 − 1 , where k i ≈ ν / 2 c ω p 2 / ω 1 2 , R d 1 ≅ ω 1 / c r 0 2 . This condition demands r 0 ω p / c 2 ν / 2 ω 1 < 1 . It is satisfied when electron density is substantially subcritical. A major limitation to present treatment comes from the neglect of Forward Raman whose growth rate goes as Andreev et al. [29] Γ ∼ 1 / 2 2 a 0 n e / n c r . It should be less than R d 1 / c . At n e / n c r ∼ 0.01 , one may avoid it for beams of low spot size.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.11.147,Polarization switching mechanism in surface-emitting semiconductor lasers,"Abstract Within the scope of the earlier proposed approach to the description of polarization dependences in VCSEL based on analysis of the experimental and theoretical data, an explicit expression for the function describing the relationship between the amplification anisotropy and the current density is suggested. The conducted numerical calculations support the peculiarities of the polarization switching (PS) process and enable one to explain the effect of the PS point anomalous shift when the current variation rate is high. A special attention is given to a fairly clear physical interpretation of the formation of polarization radiation in VCSEL.",Apr-18," OCIS codes (250.7260) Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (260.5430) Polarization (140.3430) Laser theory 1 Introduction The effect of quick switching of one linear polarization to the orthogonal polarization in the output radiation of injection semiconductor lasers has been known for a fairly long time [1,2], still being exotic to some extent due to its rather hard realization conditions. However, even at such conditions polarization switching (PS), owing to its hysteresis character, has found wide applications in various devices developed for optoelectronic systems [3]. Interest to this phenomenon has increased greatly since revealing of «spontaneous» PS in vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) [4,5], when PS occurs due to variations in the injection current. Many works associated with this problem have been published during a period of about twenty years and, nevertheless, it remains of a particular importance [6–9] as VCSEL, and PS in particular, have numerous applications [7–9]. But the PS effect is very unwanted for the majority of optoelectronic systems because of their polarization sensitivity. Different methods to suppress PS have been developed (e.g., [7,10]). However, they are associated with sophistication of the VCSEL production technology and, to some or other extent, affect the output parameters diminishing the source advantages inherent in VCSEL. The PS effect is important because it illustrates instabilities occurring in nonlinear systems − many attempts were undertaken to interpret this effect as some phase transition (e.g., see [11]), though these attempts little contributed to better understanding of its mechanism. At the present time, the most commonly used approach to interpretation of the PS effect is based on the polarizations modes approach (PMA) assuming that, due to anisotropy of gain and/or loss, two independent polarization modes are formed in a semiconductor laser. When this anisotropy is relatively high, as is usual in end-pumped semiconductor lasers, one of the modes becomes dominant and the output radiation is linearly polarized [12]. In VCSEL such anisotropy is low, being induced by the electrooptic, elastooptic, and thermal processes [6] during their production or operation, and at the particular conditions the concurrence of these modes is liable to lead to polarization instability and to the PS effects. The approach has attracted much attention since publication of the works [13,14], where the authors had developed the so-called Spin Flip Model (SFM) for the case of VCSEL with a QW active layer. SFM is a microscopic model, according to which the generation process is realized by a system of two spin subsystems whose interaction is described by the phenomenological parameter of the spin relaxation rate. As a result of concurrent radiations from the subsystems, two orthogonal linearly-polarized modes are stable, and their concurrence leads to dominance of the only one of them. Still there are some instability regions, where SP can occur. SFM is very popular because it offers explanation [14] for numerous effects accompanying PS (both types of PS, bistability, hysteresis, etc.). Nevertheless, many effects of PS may be explained from the viewpoint of the phenomenological theory that is based on rate equations, if we distinguish self- and cross-saturation of orthogonal modes [15]. But the introduction of saturation effects into SFM [16], in principle, gives similar results [15]. Despite wide applications of the above-mentioned models, they are not free from some intrinsic contradictions and both fail to describe fully all the phenomena associated with SP. The main disadvantage of SFM, and of PMA as a whole, is the introduction of the polarization mode phases as net, i.e. rigorously defined, parameters [13,14]. SFM was formed as a direct analog of a theory of gas lasers [13] characterized by slow phase relaxation. For semiconductor lasers, fast phase relaxation (dealt with in greater detail further in the text) is the case, and the rigorously defined mode phases may be considered as an asymptotic approximation, i.e. as a limit for the quasi-stationary state. Properly speaking, the introduction of two orthogonal linearly polarized modes in SFM is just associated with the limiting transition to the stable state. However, the admitted assumption of the phase definiteness results in the fact that in the region of SP the dynamic states of elliptic polarization should be formed [17,18], though they are hardly detected as the obtained data afford no unambiguous interpretation [18,19]. SFM has been extended and refined due to the introduction of a complex medium susceptibility [20]. Unfortunately, this leads to a considerable complication of the equations [21,22] containing numerous parameters the definition of which is problematic. Because of this, much favor holds a microscopic model of PMA using an asymmetric scheme of nonlinear effects [15], with the self- and cross-saturation factors considered as system’s parameters. But it should be noted that the calculation results are differing considerably [23]. Moreover, as demonstrated by the detailed studies, the results have different spectral dependences [24] and are also dependent on the pump pulse energy [25], i.e. they are the function of the process as well. These intrinsic contradictions affect the effectiveness of the approaches developed with the use of PMA. Nonlinear coupling of polarization modes has been introduced in terms of the induced nonlinear anisotropy [26]. Besides, some other corrections and supplements to the initial models have been suggested, though in several cases (e.g., see [27]) the experimental results were described inadequately. The fundamentally different approach to the description of PS – the polarization components approach (PCA) – has been based on the idea of the incoherent nonpolarized spontaneous radiation sequentially amplified in an active medium with anisotropic gain and/or loss factors. Within the scope of this approach, the PS process is considered as a sequential deterministic transition from one linearly polarized state to the orthogonal state by means of a chain of partially polarized states rather than a process resultant from concurrence of two orthogonally polarized modes. In the works [28,29], with the use of this approach, the possibility to describe the principal effects accompanying PS has been demonstrated and their fairly simple physical interpretation has been presented. In more recent works [30] it has been shown that PCA may be used to study the spectral and statistical characteristics in the region of PS. In other words, the applicability of PCA is proven. Now the applicability limits of this approach for the description of the formation of polarized radiation in VCSEL should be examined. The article is organized as follow. Section 1 presents the development of a theoretical model based on PCA; based on analysis of the literature data, we introduce the function that, in the explicit form, describes gain anisotropy depending on the injection current density. Section 2 is devoted to the numerical results obtained for the stationary approximation as well as for the case when the current increases at the constant rate. For the last case it was shown that besides the natural shift of PS point in the greater current range (that leads to hysterics phenomena) there is an effect of a reverse PS point shift for high rate of the current increases. 2 Theoretical model PCA has been considered in detail as applied to dye lasers in [31–33]. Here we deal with the main points and the requirements enabling one to describe PCA as a basic method for the description of lasing in semiconductor injection lasers, as a whole, and surface-emitting lasers, in particular. Using PCA, we first represent a plane monochromatic wave propagating along the axis z of a laboratory system with the coordinates as (1) E ( z , t ) = ∫ 0 π e ψ E ( ψ , z , t ) exp [ i ϕ ( ψ , z , t ) ] d ψ where e ψ , E(ψ, z, t), and ϕ(ψ, z, t) are the unit polarization vector, amplitude, and phase of a particular component; the angle ψ determines the polarization vector orientation e ψ relative to some axis within the wavefront plane [31]. Expression (1) represents superposition of the linearly polarized plane waves having different orientations of the polarization vector and may be considered as a generalization of the definition for a polarized plane wave with an arbitrary polarization. Indeed, to obtain the net polarization state, the functions and must be specified rigorously. To illustrate, for a linearly polarized wave, we have E(ψ, z, t)= E(z, t)δ(ψ − ψ 0). Most important, however, is the fact that Expression (1) describes partially polarized radiation as well. In this case epresents a continuous function of whereas are completely uncorrelated, i.e. 〈 ϕ ( ψ , z , t ) ϕ ′ ( ψ ′ , z ′ , t ′ ) 〉 = ϕ δ ( ψ − ψ ′ ) δ ( z − z ′ ) δ ( t − t ′ ) . With the use of the slowly varying amplitude approximation, we can derive a reduced wave equation [31], where a vector of the medium polarizability may be given in the form of (1). On condition of fast phase relaxation, that for dye molecules is below several tens of femtoseconds [31,33], we can obtain a reduced wave equation for the intensity of a particular polarization component [31], introduced in terms of the relation for the total intensity, in the following form: (2) I ( z , t ) = ∫ 0 π I ψ ( ψ , z , t ) d ψ where I ψ (ψ, z, t) − intensity of a particular polarization component. As demonstrated by the results in [32], a point model works well for the description of the PS effects, provided the pump energy distribution in the volume of the active layer is sufficiently homogeneous. In this approximation a dynamic equation for the intensity of a particular polarization component may be given in the form [31] (3) d I ( ψ ) d t = v ( k a m p − k l o s ) I ( ψ ) + L ( ψ ) where k amp (ψ) and k los (ψ) – gain and loss factors for a particular polarization component, respectively; v – velocity of light in the active medium, and the parameterL(ψ) represents an orientation component of the spontaneous radiation power density, when using the representation of (1) for its integral value. Note that the starting idea of PCA has been developed for the near-threshold region of dye lasers and was defined as a sequential amplification of the initially uncorrelated polarization components of spontaneous radiation in the case of orientation (dependent on the angle ψ) anisotropy of the gain. As shown in [33,34], an assumption of the weakly-correlated polarization components is true even for the significantly exceeded threshold. Applicability of PCA to the description of semiconductor injection lasers has been discussed in [35] but in the main the possibility to use the single-frequency approximation has been considered. As regards the base approximation of fast phase relaxation, in the case of semiconductor injection lasers, specifically VCSEL [36], it is estimated in the region of about 50fs and it seems unlikely that this relaxation is markedly varying with the pump power. The mode spectral interval for semiconductor lasers, and especially VCSEL, is much greater than that for dye lasers. Because of this, it is hard to expect that stable correlations between the polarization components are more probable. It is believed that PCA is well applicable to describe the formation of polarized radiation in semiconductor injection lasers and especially VCSEL. It is worth to underline that Eq. (3) are derived for the partial component intensity but not amplitude. In such a case it is more convenient to use photon densities rather than intensities (4) I ( ψ ) = h v 2 2 λ S ( ψ ) as is common in a semiconductor laser theory. Moreover, the use of the photon densities S(ψ) makes it possible to avoid problems with the polarization mode spectral shift and we can apply the single-frequency approximation. Now it is necessary to redefine the main parameters involved in Eq. (3). The simplest decision relates to L(ψ) because this term is determined by a contribution of spontaneous emission into the polarization component. Under assumption that spontaneous emission is isotropic (that is quite real for VCSEL), L(ψ) can be given as (5) L ( ψ ) = β N π τ N where N τ N carrier density and lifetime, β − spontaneous emission factor, and the factor π is due to the equal contributions of spontaneous emission for each of the polarization components. As a rule, the heterostructure growing process for VCSEL is organized so that the gain and loss must be isotropic [6] but, due to the technological procedures and due to the properties of semiconductor structures themselves, weak anisotropy is a result of electrooptic, elastooptic, and thermal processes. Now we suppose that this additional anisotropy provides a contribution only to the gain though it may appear in the loss [37], taking this assumption as our first approximation. Direct calculations of matrix elements for the transitions [38,39] demonstrate that the orientation dependence for an additional term of the gain caused by this anisotropy may be represented as follows: (6) k s ( ψ ) = k x cos 2 ( ψ ) + k y sin 2 ( ψ ) where the parameters k m (m = x, y) determine orientation anisotropy of an additional term of the gain with respect to the crystallographic axes of an active layer and should be weak functions of the injection current densityj. Unfortunately, no theoretical calculations of a similar function have been found in literature − as a rule, the phenomenologically introduced functions are used. For example, the authors of [15,40] have examined a weak linear dependence of k x , whereas k y was considered to be independent of At the same time, the calculations for the gain factor anisotropy as a function of internal stresses [41] point to a certain (and in some cases [42] to a complete) antisymmetry, i.e. an increase in must be accompanied by a decrease of and vice versa. But linearity of the system’s response may be considered as our second approximation because it is supported by the results [43] of direct measurements of the effects exerted by mechanical and thermal stresses on anisotropy of the gain. Because of this, it is assumed that, for the factors the precise antisymmetry is fulfilled and the gain factor k amp may be written as (7) k a m p = g 0 ( N − N t r ) ( 1 + k 0 ( 1 − j j p s ) cos 2 ψ ) where g 0 ( N − N ) t r – standard expression for the gain factor of semiconductor injection lasers [44,45], N tr – concentration of transparency, j ps – injection current corresponding to PS, k 0 – relative gain dichroism – dimensionless parameter determining the variation rate of a degree of anisotropy for the gain η found from the relation (8) η ( J ) = ( k a m p ) x − ( k a m p ) y ( k a m p ) x + ( k a m p ) y = k 0 ( 1 − j j p s ) In principle, the value of k 0 is selected from the experimental data and in fact it is an adjustable parameter. By the present moment, the only significant constraint is the requirement for k 0 <<1. Estimating the value of we can take into consideration that it should determine the PS region width, i.e. the current range Δj, where a degree of polarization is varying from −1 to +1 or vice versa. Actually, a width of the PS region is also determined by other factors [15]. We start our reasoning from the estimate given by the authors in [46]: separation of polarization modes begins in the regionη ∼5·10−5. Assuming that suppression of one of the modes takes place for that is greater by an order of magnitude, and at a relative width of the PS region Δ j / j p s ≈ 0.1 , we can obtain k > 0 5 ⋅ 10 − 4 . A more specific estimate of k 0can be obtained with the data of the gain for two orthogonal polarization modes from [47]. Supposing j ps =1.5j th , we have k 0 ≅0.04. Moreover, from the data of [48] it follows that k 0 ≅0.003. So we can suppose that 10−1 < k 0 <10−3. As follows from our further calculations, this estimate is quite correct. Introducing the gain induced anisotropy as a function of the injection current density, the authors of [15,40] have emphasized that the form of this function is of no particular importance. Besides, linearity of such a function is strongly justified only close to the point of PS. Indeed, release of the thermal energy is growing with the injection current density j, especially in the stationary mode of excitation. As the heat power is proportional to j 2, additional influence of the thermal processes should result in the nonlinear function η(j). In principle, nothing can exclude a decrease in a degree of the induced anisotropy, when we can obtain the second point of PS for higher j ′ p s but this time – for inverse PS. Such an effect of two PS points is fairly often observed experimentally (e.g., see [49]), though the reasons underlying this phenomenon may be considerably more complex due to spectral effects disregarded in a single-frequency model. An interesting feature in representation of the gain in the form given by (7) is that the average value of the gain factor over the angles ψ is independent of j − in line with a linear dependence of the total output intensity I ( j ) o u t . Just this dependence is observed in the majority of cases, without any manifestations of the PS point. Still such a behavior of I ( j ) o u t is not general, one can also observe [49] nonlinearities of the function Iout (j) and intensity jumps at the point of PS. Consequently, the representation given by (7) is not universal and it should be generalized with due regard for the spectral effects. It should be noted that, at special conditions, the loss can also have the anisotropic component [37] that may be represented by (7). In this case the difference in the induced gain and loss should be described by a linear function of j. Considering the above-mentioned assumptions, we assume (9) k a m p − k l o s = g 0 ( N − N t r ) ( 1 + k 0 ( 1 − j j p s ) cos 2 ψ ) − k l o s ' where k l a s ' = ρ + 1 2 L ln 1 R 1 R 2 , ρ − isotropic intrinsic loss, L − cavity length, R 1, R 2 − reflectivity of up and down Bragg’s reflectors. The parameter k 0 determines a degree of anisotropy for the difference in the induced gain and loss that may be referred to as the amplification dichroism . But in order to simplify our further calculations, we suppose that additional anisotropy relates only to the gain and consider the loss to be fully isotropic. Then we can write the final form of a dynamic equation for the photon density component S(ψ) as follows: (10) d S ( ψ ) d t = Γ β N π τ N − v ( Γ g 0 ( N − N t r ) ( 1 + k 0 ( 1 − j j p s ) cos 2 ψ ) − ρ + 1 2 L ln 1 R 1 R 2 ) S ( ψ ) where τ N − carrier lifetime in an active layer, Γ − optical confinement factor (for QW active layer). Now it is necessary to add the equation for the carrier densityN. As, in essence, equations (10) are rate equations, the evolution of N is adequately described by the classical rate equation [44,45], where the effect of a field of laser radiation must be integral for a set of polarization components (11) d N d t = j e d − v ∫ g 0 ( N − N t r ) ( 1 + k 0 ( 1 − j j p s ) cos 2 ψ ) S ( ψ ) d ψ − N τ N where e − electron charge, d- active layer thickness, τ N − carrier lifetime in the active layer. To find a solution for system (10) and (11), we use the numerical methods. The values of the main parameters are listed in Table 1 . 3 Analysis of numerical calculations Note that quite natural the main results we have obtained are in agreement with the results of [28]. But, due to the definition of the function that describes a weak gain anisotropy, some peculiarities of polarization switching are revealed explicitly. 3.1 Steady state approximation First of all, it should be noted that MPM gives a new interpretation of PS and we exert every effort to verify that. Let us consider that the injection current is switched on at t =0and it reaches the steady state value in 1ns. The finite speed of the current growth is of no special importance and is needed to decrease the influence of transient processes. Our calculations show that the time required to attain the steady state values of the output intensity is in the region of 10ns and is weakly dependent on j and k 0. A very different pattern is observed for a polarization degree that is defined in the classical way as (12) P = I x − I y I x + I y = ∫ I ( ψ ) ( cos 2 ψ − sin 2 ψ ) d ψ ∫ I ( ψ ) ( cos 2 ψ + sin 2 ψ ) d ψ = ∫ I ( ψ ) cos 2 ψ d ψ I where I x and I y are components of the total intensity I passing through the polarizer orientated along the axes x and y, respectively. Both the steady state value P and the time needed to attain such a value is greatly dependent not only on but also on the relation between the injection current density and its value at the point of PS. As seen from the functions given in Fig. 1 , at the same value of the values of are decreasing as the difference j − j ps decreases, while the time required to attain the stationary values is growing. At the same time, an increase in k 0 leads to the contrary situation. This is absolutely understandable: increase of k 0 and decrease of the difference j − j ps are both determined by the growth of the gain anisotropy and vice versa. All the foregoing data support the assumption made in [28] that the limiting values of a polarization degree are determined by the finite photon lifetime in a laser cavity – the laser intensity and also anisotropy of the orientation distribution for the polarization component E(ψ) governing the polarization degree are increased simultaneously. The intensity quickly reaches its steady state value at a relatively low polarization, and then the orientation distribution collapse takes place at the practically invariable total intensity that, in fact, is determined by the carrier density N. Actually, the latter is practically constant and the intensity is redistributed between the polarization components due to anisotropy of the gain. Anisotropy in the region of the PS point becomes very low. Because of this, the components with high gain fail to suppress those with lower gain due to the finite photon lifetime in a laser cavity and radiation becomes partially polarized. The effect exerted by the photon lifetime in a cavity on the formation of polarized radiation should be most marked in dynamics. Let us consider not the steady state limit but a pure time dynamics of the output-radiation polarization components (Fig. 2 ). It is seen that, after the threshold, both polarized components of the intensity are varying in a similar way, their separation occurs with the lapse of time. The period of time when the components reveal a synchronous behavior is greatly dependent on dichroism of the induced anisotropy k 0 and also on the relation j / j p s , being in the region from 0.2 to 4ns and in line with the experimental results [50]. The functions derived completely support the assumption that initially the formed radiation is nonpolarized or weakly polarized and then its polarization degree is changing due to the intensity redistribution of some polarization components, while the total intensity remains practically invariable. 3.2 Approximation of a constantly growing current Now let us consider the radiation formation dynamics when the current is growing sequentially at a constant rate. This approach to PS is used when there is a need to exclude the effect of heating of the active region [51]. We assume that the injection current density is linearly increased from zero up to the value considerably exceeding j ps , see Fig. 3 . For the selected reference value k 0 =0.01 (Fig. 4 а), we can observe both the increased threshold value j th and the increased j ps at the point of PS. In fact, both phenomena have been described in [50], though the effect was lower considerably. This is explainable as in [50] such a growth was not from zero but from the value j 0 ≈0.5j th . In any case, these effects are identically associated with finiteness of the photon lifetime in a cavity – when the current is relatively fast growing, radiation fails to attain the values corresponding to the stationary process. Besides, at a high rate of the current increase, the point of PS begins to shift to lower values. This effect has been observed experimentally by М. Sondermann as stated in his thesis [52] but the author presented no explanations for the effect and never returned to it in his further publications. To explain the effect of the backward shifted PS point, let us consider the form of the corresponding functions: after the threshold, a degree of polarization never approaches the limiting values − the polarization switching process begins for radiation with a low degree of orientation anisotropy that is more easily compensated by anisotropic amplification. This may be confirmed by the data in Fig. 3b obtained at a much higher degree of the amplification dichroism (k 0 =0.1). In this case a minimal polarization degree is very close to −1 and there is no backward shift of the PS point. Next, let us consider a shift in the threshold current with the increased pumping rate. When for the curves given in Fig. 3 we define the scale of relative values of the current density j / j t h (Fig. 4), the situation is somewhat changed. We have the backward shifted PS point for k 0=0.1 as well, but only for a single curve with a minimal value far from −1. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of the polarization components approach to describe the polarization effects in surface-emitting lasers and the possibility of a unified interpretation for the observed effects due to the deterministic formation process of laser radiation. 4 Conclusion In this way, the phenomenological introduction of the function describing a weak gain anisotropy enables us to verify a mechanism of polarization switching in VCSEL as a process of sequential transformation of the initial linear polarization into orthogonal polarization by means of a sequence of the partially polarized states upon variation of the injection current. Besides, within the scope of the developed approach, we can describe the effect of anomalous SP shift when the current is varying at a high rate. It should be noted that the proposed approach is based on a clear physical concept: the process of lasing is activated by the spontaneous radiation that is initially incoherent. In the process of amplification, both the intensity and the polarization degree is growing. As the intensity growing rate determines the difference in gain and loss and the polarization growing rate is determined by their anisotropy, at a relatively low value of such anisotropy, the polarization growing rate is considerably lower than the intensity growing rate. Because of this, in the case of stationary excitation the intensity rapidly runs to its stationary value, whereas polarization arrives at its stationary value much slower. Here the second factor is important – finiteness of the photon lifetime in a cavity. This means that every photon initiating the process of sequential (avalanche) amplification can form a confined flux of such photons, their number being proportional to the amplification value for this orientation of the polarization vector by this group of the photons, i.e. it is dependent on the angle ψ. Since attainment of a stationary value of the lasing intensity means that the carrier density also arrives at its stationary value, further growth of the polarization degree is possible only due to redistribution of the polarization components: an increase in the intensity of “stronger” components is realized by suppression of the “weaker” ones. Representing the orientation distribution function I(ψ) in the form of a particular oval, we can see that evolution of laser radiation is associated with elongation of this oval on the retention of its area. However, note that, for a relatively low amplification anisotropy, the saturation effects are important: amplification of the “stronger” components diminishes with respect to the “weaker” components, and a particular equilibrium is achieved when the “distribution oval” is invariable. This means that a stationary value (that is below 1) of the polarization degree is attained. In the limit when amplification is isotropic (PS point) such equilibrium occurs from the beginning, whereas the polarization degree is zero. Considering that spontaneous radiation is weakly polarized, with a weak orientation polarization of its components, such anisotropy may be compensated by the amplification anisotropy, leading to some shifting of the PS point without changes in a mechanism of the polarized radiation formation. In principle, when the injection current is varying in time, the pattern of the polarization radiation formation is not changed. But when the current is varying at a high rate, the effects of delay will be revealed both for the intensity (by the shifted threshold values) and polarization (lowering of the polarization growth rate), see Figs. 3 and 4. Note that the proposed approach (PCA) from the start includes the formation dynamics of polarized radiation while PCA seems to divide the process into two stages: first, the two modes are independently enforced, and then they are concurrent. This is the reason why a contribution of spontaneous radiation into PCA is so important, unlike the initial SFM model [13,14], where such contribution is not involved.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.137,Characterization of the sandblasted glass degradation by light scattering,"Abstract In Sahara region, the sandstorms cause a serious damage of windshield vehicle. The windscreen wear for driver visibility in vehicle lighting is very important and it is related to the stay light by transmission or reflection. This paper presents a study of the light scattering transmittance and reflectance on a sandblasted soda–lime–silica glass. A stay light measurement which characterizes the level sandblasting degradation was assessed using the stay light index ‘SLI’. The results show that the SLI values were found to be linearly to the surface damage and a relationship was established between the SLI and the surface roughness’ Ra’. An SLI critical value which seems to be adopted as the cut-off for the use limit of wear windshield was determined.",Apr-18," Keywords Glass Sandblasting Scattering Reflection Transmission Roughness 1 Introduction The visibility of objects through a car glass windshield can be affected by its surface state. The exterior windshield surface is differently exposed to damaging effect caused by dust, hail or sand according to the geographical region [1,2]. In Saharan regions for instance, sandblasting during sandstorms can affect tremendously the vehicles windshields surfaces. This inevitable and undesirable glass erosion phenomenon induces stray light that is harmful to drivers’ vision particularly at night and during sunset or dawn. In this context, during the daylight, the eye is adapted to stronger light with many different wavelengths, therefore the impact of stray light is not very severe at this time. However, in the case of on-coming headlights of another vehicle at night, the light that hits the windscreen suddenly can be deflected into the driver’s eye by means of wide angle light scattering, causing the genesis of ghost image in the field of conductor view [3,4]. The conductor loss visibility is a consequence of reducing objects contrast which is caused by stray light. The stray light by transmission or reflection caused by the soiling and/or windshields vehicles damage. Light that has been disturbed and deviated more than 2.5 degrees on the average is referred to as “stray light”. It depends on various factors such as the inclination angle, the intensity of the light source and the surface state of the windshields [5,6]. The ratio of the intensity of the stray light to the intensity of useful light defines the degree of windscreen degradation and it is critical for driver [7]. This ratio is called the reduced luminance coefficient and is also referred to as the Scattered Light Index (SLI). According to the German Standard DIN 52298-1 [8], the SLI is equivalent to the scattering distribution function on the transmitting side of the scattering surface at 1.8 scattering angle, multiplied by the transmission of the windows. Timmerman [2] restricts the measurement of the stray light to a limited range of angles, from 1.5 to 2 degrees. In this work, we carry out a study of the light scattering by reflection and transmission induced by surface heterogeneities caused by sandblasting on soda–lime–silica glass samples. The aim of this study is to optically characterize the sandblasted glass degradation, to establish a relationship between Scattered Light Index ‘SLI’ and roughness ‘Ra’ and to determine the good windshield visibility limit, in terms of SLI critical value. This latter is calculated from the SLI expression defined by Timmermann and Gehring [9]. 2 Materials and test conditions The samples were prepared from a soda-lime glass manufactured by AFRICAVER (an Algerian company located at Jijel region). The dimensions used were 50 × 50 × 3 mm3. In order to simulate the effects of the sandstorm on the surface state of a glass, a sand blower apparatus was used (Fig. 1 ). The eroded glass samples were submitted to different projected sand masses varying between 10 and 100 g at a normal impact angle (the samples are oriented perpendicularly to the sand flux). The Size range of the sand grains is about (250÷350) μm and the sand flow speed was fixed at 16 m/s which is about the average speed encountered in the Sahara sandstorms. In real conditions, sand wind velocities vary usually between 12 and 25 m/s. We took as a reference sample without any damaging effect, a glass sample in its received state. Fig. 2 shows typical example photos of the glass samples damaged by different projected sand masses. For low projected sand mass, there are individual impacts, but for higher projected sand mass, the damages extend and cover the entire exposed surface which reaches a saturated state. 3 Optical experimental apparatus Fig. 3 shows the schematic principle of the optical apparatus prepared for the purpose of this study. It consists in illuminating a sample fixed on the vertical goniometric plane at variable illuminating angle (α = 30° and 60°) from a 300 W white light xenon source. The emitted light beam is collimated by a Koehler system composed of a condenser” C”, a lens” L” and two diaphragms (a field diaphragm” FD” and an aperture diaphragm” AD”) before being diffused by the eroded analyzed surface area whose diameter is 3 mm. The transmitted and reflected beams are captured by a phototransistor (T) which is mounted on a mobile arm. This latter is solidly attached to goniometric rotating table. The phototransistor (T) is placed at a distance of 50 mm from the analyzed surface where the measuring elementary solid angle corresponds to d Ω  = 1.97.10−3 sr. It allows converting the luminous energy into electrical energy expressed in EVA type nano-ammeter (10 nA-1 mA). The position of the phototransistor (T) in relation to the specular direction at the surface determines the diffusion angle θ. The goniometer is composed of a fixed table graded from 0° to 360° and a moving table equipped with a graded jack between 0°à 30°. The optical system resolution is of 1’ (1/60°). In this study, we determined the variations of the scattered light normalized intensity with variations of angle θ at a pace of 10’. 4 Results and discussion Fig. 4 shows the angular scattering distribution transmission and reflection versus the scattering angle for the different projected sand mass (Mp = 0, 10, 20, 50 and 100) g at the illuminating angle (α = 30° and 60°). One can notice clearly that for the representing low projected sand mass curves (Mp ≤ 20 g), the best fitting function of the transmittance and reflectance curves is that of the Gaussian function while for the other curves that the projected sand mass is higher (Mp ≥ 50 g), the best fitting function is that of the Lorentz function. Consequently, we can conclude that, in the case of low surface damage, the most of the incident light is concentrated in the specular direction and in the case where the surface state is more damaged, the transmitted and reflected light diffused in large scattering angle. Fig. 5 illustrates clearly this result. As the projected sand mass increases, the specular transmittance and reflectance decreases and reaches the minimum values of 13% and 1% respectively while the scattered transmittance and reflectance increases and reaches the maximum values of 81% and 8% respectively at the illuminating angle (α = 60°). We concluded that the degradation of surface state induces the losses in specular transmittance and reflectance, the increase in scattering transmittance and reflectance which is caused by the increasing damage surface. The surface degradation is characterized by the increasing roughness of the eroded samples. The opposite evolution of both specular transmittance and reflectance, the scattering transmittance and reflectance curves, reveal that the loss of optical transmission is essentially attributed to the light reflected and the scattering transmittance. Furthermore, the majority of scattered transmission is enormously dominated in comparison with scattered reflection. Mefford et al. [10] reported that during daytime driving, of the total veiling luminance that the driver sees, about 60% was attributable to reflection dash board and about 40% to scatter. 5 Characterization of the sandblasted glass degradation It is well known that the most modern techniques use the Scattered Light Index “SLI” as a measure of windscreen degradation. In this study, we have calculated the light scattering index “SLI” from the expression defined by Timmermann [9] as following: S L I = 1 / Ω Q 1 R / Q 1 L – Q 0 R / Q 0 L 1 Where, Ω : Solid angle. Q o L : Specular light transmits without specimen. Q 1 L : Specular light transmits with specimen. Q o R : Scattered light transmits without specimen. Q 1 R : Scattered light transmits without specimen. Fig. 6 illustrates the SLI variation versus the projected sand mass. This curve shows a regular increase of the Scattered Light Index from 0.43 up to 4.5 sr−1 and then tends toward a constant level. It is the saturating state which occurs from mass larger than 50 g. For the low projected sand masses (low surface damage), the diffuse light is very small, from which it has a low SLI value, whereas for the important projected sand masses (higher surface damage), the totality of the light is diffused in a wide diffusion angle, hence the value of SLI is important. Helmers et al. [11] reported that the very worn windshield present an SLI value of 3.04 cd m−2 lux−1 and a relative detection distance was found to be linearly related to the mean SLI values of the windshields. In the same veiw, Timmermann [9] concluded that, the SLI value found is about 4.31 cd m−2 lux−1 corresponding to wiper damage. As to Derkum [12], the SLI value attains 6.3 cd m−2 lux−1 relative to the damage in windshield caused by the wiper. The variation of the surface roughness ‘Ra’ versus the projected sand mass is presented in Fig. 7 . It is clear that this curve represents a similar tendency like the Scattered Light Index curve. Thus, we have represented the variation of the Scattered Light Index ‘SLI’ versus the surface roughness ‘Ra’ Fig. 8 . We show that, a linear relationship was obtained between SLI and Ra and the best fitting function is that of a single degree polynomial. The flowing expression defines this relation: (2) S L I = 1.78 R a + 0.3 Where, SLI = 0.3 (SLI of the measuring system) From this expression and knowing the Ra limit value, we have determined the SLI critical value limit. Note that, the Ra limit value was graphically obtained, based on the transmission value limit “Tlim” given by B. Savaëte [13] Fig. 9 .We remind that, the tolerated visibility limit which corresponds to a minimal value of the valid transmission in Europe is 75% while it is 70% in Japan and in the United States of America. As to Derkum [14], the exact transmission value, from which drivers’ vision becomes significantly worse, lies between 60% and 70%. In this work, we opted to the medium value of the transmission limit Tlim = 70%. Thus, the SLI value limit obtained is 1.46 sr−1 which corresponds to the roughness critical value Ra = 0.66 μm. Therefore, values below 1.46 sr−1 define a good visibility domain corresponding to low windscreen damage and low light scattering. Timmermann [2] has reported that, when driving with a degraded windscreen, the minimum stray light index values which cause an important reduction on driver perception are 1.1 (re-adaptation times) and 1.7 (detection distances). Therefore we can conclude that, the SLI value limit obtained in our study is included in the interval [1.1–1.7] which is reported by Timmermann. 6 Conclusion In this work, we simulated the effect of sand blasting on the surface of a soda-lime glass. The results lead to the conclusions that the projected sand mass parameter affects enormously the transmittance and the reflectance with a different behaviour. This influence is very important especially when the projected sand mass became greater than 50 g at the illuminating angle (α = 60°). By varying the projected sand mass, the surface damage increases and brings about a decrease of the specular transmittance and reflectance which reach the minimum values of 13% and 1% respectively, as for the scattered transmittance and reflectance increase and reach the maximum values of 81% and 8% respectively. Therefore, the loss of the optical transmission is essentially attributed to the light reflected and the scattering transmittance. Characterization of the sandblasting degradation by the calculation of the SLI provides us with the possibility to distinguish between acceptable and non-acceptable windscreen damage or good and impaired visibility. The established relationship between Ra and SLI largely helps the authorities to simply assess the limit of good visibility. "," [1] H.

The negative electron affinity is generated from the proper sensitization of In0.53Ga0.47As(100)β2(2 × 4) surface. Doping and sensitization are indispensable in the preparation of InGaAs photocathode. However, the surface doping mechanism of InGaAs is not clear. This article focuses on the suitable doping sites of substitutional Zn atoms for sensitization on In0.53Ga0.47As(100)β2(2 × 4) surface. Considering the symmetry, there are eight doping sites and the eight doping surface models are formed. The surface atomic structures and surface formation energies of these models are discussed. The lower the formation energy is, the more stable the surface is. Zn4 and Zn5 are the more stable doping models based on the analysis of formation energy. Therefore the band structure, surface charge distribution, work function and optical properties are further discussed for these two doping models. The Zn4 doping surface has a lower work function and reflectivity and better absorption in the range of 1–3 μm than Zn5. In a word, the InGaAs surface with Zn4 doped is more conducive to the photoelectrons transport and photoemission. Then Zn4 is the most favorable doping site for the InGaAs photocathode.",Apr-18," Keywords Zn doping In0.53Ga0.47As(100)β2(2 × 4) surface Formation energy Electronic structure 1 Introduction In0.53Ga0.47As is a good sensing material in the field of military night vision. The image of the negative electron affinity (NEA) photocathode In0.53Ga0.47As is clear and it’s hard to be detected by electronic reconnaissance and interference. It is suitable to use in extremely weak night as the high response speed and the good sensitivity and resolution [1,2]. According to W. E. Spicer's three-step model of photoemission [3], the photoemission capability is related to the doping and surface morphology besides of the internal structure of the photocathode. It has been shown that the Zn doping in the GaAs bulk and surface is favorable for the transport of photoelectrons to the surface and improve the photoemission [4,5]. It’s indicated that the interaction between the Zn doping and the As vacancy defects is benefit for the photoelectrons transport in bulk In0.53Ga0.47As [6]. However, the doping of Zn atoms in In0.53Ga0.47As surface has not been studied due to many kinds of reconstructions on the In0.53Ga0.47As (100) surface. The β2(2 × 4) reconstruction can provide stages and holes for later Cs-O adsorption to form NEA surface [7]. The doping sites and depth of Zn atoms in In0.53Ga0.47As (100)β2(2 × 4) surface are investigated to make preparation for NEA surface in this article. The atomic structure, band structure, electron distribution and work function of the Zn doped In0.53Ga0.47As (100)β2(2 × 4) surfaces are calculated and analyzed. The contribution of Zn doping to the formation of the NEA In0.53Ga0.47As surface is explained theoretically and the most favorable Zn doping sites are found out. 2 Models and methods Zn-doped surface models were built when a Ga atom or In atom was substituted by a Zn atom in the intrinsic In0.53Ga0.47As (100) β2 (2 × 4) surface model (six layers), shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). The difference of the band structure, electron distribution and optical properties was not significant whether Zn substituted Ga or In atom in bulk In0.53Ga0.47As [12]. As a result only doping sites were considered when Zn was doped in the surface models. Zn atom was doped to replace the Group III atoms in the fourth or sixth layer, regardless of whether Ga or In was replaced. Considering the symmetry, Zn substituted one of the four atoms of Group III in sixth layer, generating four models named Zn1, Zn2, Zn3 and Zn4, shown in Fig.1(a). The other four Zn doping models named Zn5, Zn6, Zn7 and Zn8 were generated when Zn atom substituted one of the Group III atoms in the fourth layer, shown in Fig.1(b). These substitution sites in fourth layer were chosen mainly considering the stages and holes on the β2(2 × 4) reconstruction surface as the dipole was generated between doped Zn and the Cs and O atoms adsorbed, which helped to form NEA surface. The ab initio quantum mechanics program of Cambrige Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [8] based on density function theory (DFT) combined with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [9,10] was used to perform the calculations. The bulk and surface models were optimized by the Broyden Flecher Goldfarb Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. The energy cutoff of the final sets of energies was computed as 400eV. The integral in the Brillouin zone was sampled with the Monkhorst-Pack [11] scheme and special k points of high symmetry. The number of k points is 4 × 2 × 1 in calculation of the surface model. Valence electrons in orbit of Ga (3d, 4s, 4p), In (4d, 5s, 5p), As (4s, 4p) and Zn (3d, 4s) were only considered during the calculations and the analysis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Surface relaxation and formation energy For the surface of InAs and GaAs, the stability of the reconstructed surface is not only related to the atomic structure but also to the formation energy of surface [13–17]. The lower the formation energy is, the more stable the surface is. In0.53Ga0.47As is also III-IV compound and its atomic and surface structures are similar to those in InAs and GaAs. The undoped reconstruction surface In0.53Ga0.47As(100)β2(2 × 4) contained four kinds of atoms, In, Ga, As and H saturated on the bottom and its formation energy is shown in Ref. [7]. For the doped models, a Ga or In atom is replaced by a Zn atom. Then the formation energy is deduced as Eq. (1). (1) σ = E d o p e − s u r f − E s u r f − ( μ Z n − μ i ) A where σ is the formation energy, A is the area of the surface model, E d o p e − s u r f is the surface energy of doped model, E s u r f is that of undoped model, μ Z n is the chemical potential of Zn, μ i is the chemical potential of Ga or In atom when it is replaced by Zn atom in the surface model. The surface energy and the formation energy of the undoped and the doped models after geometrical optimization are shown in Table 1 . The formation energy of the Zn6 and Zn8 surface models is positive. It is shown that about 3 eV/ Å2 will be absorbed from outside when the Ga or In atom is replaced to form doped surface, which indicates that the models Zn6 and Zn8 are not so stable because they are at the high energy point. As a result the Zn atom will be separated out in the real In0.53Ga0.47As surface due to the surface effect. The formation energies of the other six surface models are all negative, which means the energies are released during the doping. These six models are more stable than Zn6 and Zn8. The Zn4 and Zn5 models are the most stable surface because of the most energy they released and the doped Zn atoms are just under the As-As dimers, which are benefit for the surface doping. In In0.53Ga0.47As photocathode Zn doping is prepared for the following alternative adsorption of the Cs and O atoms to form NEA surface and the Zn atoms doped in the Zn4 and Zn5 sites under the As-As dimers are suitable for the adsorption according to the traditional theory. Based on the above analysis, the other properties of Zn4 and Zn5 surface models are focused on and discussed as followed. The atomic radius and the outer electrons decrease due to the divalent Zn ions. The surface atomic relaxation of the doped In0.53Ga0.47As is shown in Table 2 . In Table 2, L1-1 and L1-2 are the length of the two As-As dimers on the first layer and L3 is that on the third layer. D1 and D2 are the distances between the As atoms in the two As-As dimers. It is shown in Table 2 that the positions of atoms which form stages are changed little when the Ga atom is substituted by the Zn atom in the models of Zn4 and Zn5. Then the Changes caused by Zn doping should be more reflected in the work function and electronic structure. 3.2 Energy bands and electronic structure The periodic potential which affects the moving of electrons becomes aperiodic when the Zn doping happens. The electrons movements are changed and the new energy levels, especially the localized levels confined around the doping atoms which are different from those in the ideal crystal, are generated in the band gap. According to the localized energy levels away from the edge of the band, shallow and deep levels are differentiated. The characters of the doped Zn in group II are similar to the substituted Ga and In atoms in group III except the number of outer electrons. An electron is obtained to form a covalent bond and a hole is created in the valence band as the doped Zn atom has one less outer electron than the substituted Ga or In atom. Shallow acceptor levels are generated and appear near the top of valence band. Therefore, the energy levels around Fermi level in the band gap are analyzed after doping. The energy bands of Zn4 and Zn5 models are shown in Fig. 2 . New energy levels arise in the band gap in both Zn4 and Zn5 models, shown in Fig. 2. The wave functions are expanded within a bigger volume than the primitive cell although the electrons in the impurity state are bound around the doped Zn atom. Compared to the impurity potential, which can be considered as perturbation, crystalline potential plays a leading role. Acceptor levels of Zn4 model are closer to the top of valence band than Zn5 model. The doped Zn in sixth layer of Zn4 model is right under the As-As dimer in third layer, which is slightly farer from the surface than that in Zn5. Then the wave functions expansion of Zn4 is less affected by the surface than Zn5. The new shallow impurity energy levels generated by Zn doping narrow the energy gap further. For Zn5 model, there are some differences. The doped Zn in fourth layer of Zn5 model is under the two As-As dimers in the first layer. The conduction band moves to the high energy region and the band gap increases. Two impurity levels in the band gap are a little far from the top of the valence band. Based on the analysis above, Zn doped at Zn4 site is more benefit for the narrowing of the band gap and the transition of the photoelectrons. For further analysis, the electron density difference of Zn4 and Zn5 models is shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3, blue indicates the loss of electrons and red means the increase while black represents no change in this area. It is dark red at the position of the Zn and In atoms in the fourth layer of Zn5 model, which means massive charge enrichment, shown as Fig. 3(b) and (d). On the contrary, the doped Zn is blue in Zn4 model which means the charge loss, shown in Fig. 3(a) and (c). For the other atoms, As atoms in the first layer and Ga atoms in the fourth layer have some charge enrichment and the other charges mostly distribute in bonds in Fig. 3(a) and (c). Covalent bonds are generated between the doped Zn and the atoms around in Zn4 model. However, the doped Zn in Zn5 model obtains electrons from the other atoms around and formed covalent bonds with strong ionic character. The charge distribution and the bonds are also analyzed from population. The population around the doped Zn atom is shown in Table 3 In Table 3, the Zn atom loses 0.1 electrons in Zn4 model which is more than 0.01 electrons in Zn5 model. The As1, As2, As3 and As4 atoms in Zn4 model obtain 0.10, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.20 electrons separately and it is clear for the electrons enrichment. The charges of the As atoms around the doped Zn atom in Zn5 model are -0.11, 0.00, -0.16 and 0.16 electrons. Electrons of the As atoms happen to be got, lost or kept the same. There is still enrichment of electrons around the bond between the doped Zn and As atoms as the bond population shown in Table 3. It is indicated that the charge distribution of Zn5 model is affect by the surface than by the doped Zn as the Zn atom is closer to the surface than that in Zn4 model. The closer to the surface is, the more the charge distribution and the bonds of the models are changed. 3.3 The work function of the Zn-doped surfaces Electron affinity is generally positive. It is an electronic barrier to prevent electrons escape from the bulk. It comes from the first ionization energy of the discrete atoms that make up the solid. When a large number of atoms get close to each other to form a solid, the atom energy levels split into energy bands. The electron affinity of most solid elements is lower than the first ionization energy of the corresponding discrete atoms because of the energy levels’ upwards bend. Most of the photoelectrons are from the valence band and the photoemission is affected as the electron affinity is changed effectively by upwards bend of the defect levels in the NEA photocathode [18]. The Fermi level in the bulk is close to the bottom of conduction band while that in the surface is on the top half of the band gap. Fig. 4 shows the band structure of the n-type GaAs surface measured by a UV photoelectron spectrometer (UPS). E0 is the vacuum level. The core level of 3d state of Ga in the bulk is about 18.81 eV far from the valence band maximum (VBM) for the n-type GaAs [18–21]. The band bends up and a barrier is formed to restrain electrons escape due to the surface potential. The surface barrier model of n-type In0.53Ga0.47As is similar to GaAs. Then the In0.53Ga0.47As with Zn doped is p-type and the impurity band is near the VBM, shown in Fig. 5 . The Fermi level is in the lower half of the band gap due to the As dangling bonds. At equilibrium, the surface Fermi level must be equal to the bulk, which causes the energy band a downward bending near the surface, as shown in Fig. 5. On the other hand, Zn doping on the surface produces many holes and accelerates the movement of electrons to the surface, which is favorable for the photoelectron emission. The work function is further reduced after doping. The work functions of Zn4 and Zn5 models are 3.962 eV and 4.011 eV respectively, which are decreased by 0.312 eV and 0.263 eV compared with 4.274 eV of intrinsic In0.53Ga0.47As. For the work function, Zn doped in Zn4 and Zn5 sites both causes the surface work function to decline. The band bending region (BBR) is formed on the surface, which is benefit for the transport and the emission of photoelectrons. H owever, it is more obvious in Zn4 model in the decline of the work function, reaching 7.3%. 3.4 Optical properties of the Zn-doped surfaces After Zn doping, new impurity levels appear on the surface. The photoelectron transitions among impurity and continuous levels also play an important role in the absorption and emission of light and the capture and release of carriers. It has a significant impact on the optical properties of photocathode. It is the first step that the electrons get energy from the incident photons. The absorption coefficient α, which is related to the incident photon energy and the material character, indicates absorption capacity. It is found that the absorption edge moves to the long wavelength.as the doping concentration increases in GaAs photocathode. As a result, the GaAs photocathode still has a spectral response at 930 nm. Then the absorption coefficient curves of Zn4 and Zn5 doping surface models are shown in Fig. 6 . In Fig. 6, the absorption coefficient peaks of Zn4 and Zn5 surface models both appears at 302.56 nm in the short wave UV region. However, the short wave limit depends on the window layer and In0.53Ga0.47As photocathode mainly works in the infrared area. Therefore, the infrared work region from 1000 to 3000 nm is focused on. The absorption coefficient of Zn4 model is significantly greater than the Zn5, which also corresponds to the structure of energy band. The energy gap of the Zn4 model is obviously smaller than that of the Zn5. The light can be absorbed as much as possible in Zn4 model. The photon energy is converted to the kinetic energy for the electrons transition and emission. In conclusion, Zn doped in Zn4 site is more suitable than Zn5 from the analysis of the absorption coefficient. Another optical property is reflectivity, as shown in Fig. 7 . The reflection peaks are both at 230.3 nm in UV region, which makes no sense for infrared photocathode in Fig. 7. The reflectivity of Zn4 model is less than that of Zn5. The Zn atom doped in Zn4 site reduces the light reflection on the surface. The surface with Zn4 doped allows more light to enter the photocathode than Zn5. For the reflectivity, the Zn4 model is more advantageous than Zn5, which is consistent with the analysis of absorption coefficient. 4 Conclusions This article focuses on the surface doped with Zn atom for In0.53Ga0.47As photocathodes. The atomic structure and the formation energy are analyzed firstly. The Zn4 and Zn5 are considered as the suitable doping sites according to the stability. The energy bands, electronic structures, work functions and optical properties of these two doping surfaces are analyzed concretely. It is concluded that the surface with Zn4 doped can not only narrow the band gap and improve the electronic structure, but also have advantages in optical absorption coefficient and reflectivity. Therefore, Zn4 site is more appropriate for doping in In0.53Ga0.47As surfaces for infrared photocathodes.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.007,Research on traffic decision making method based on image analysis case based reasoning,"Abstract As the deteriorating urban traffic incurs multiple traffic safety problems, this article designed a system framework for the traffic monitoring and management system according to its characteristics and provided a traffic emergency aid decision making method by integrating the case-based reasoning specific to the traffic emergencies. Meanwhile, the article built a traffic aid decision making case base, designed overall-local characteristic attribute similarity calculating measures and provided a case retrieval strategy. Finally the traffic aid decision making method was verified by examples.",Apr-18," Keywords Image analysis Case-based reasoning Traffic congestion Similarity 1 Introduction In recent years, the number of vehicles increases rapidly with economic development, but road construction speed cannot keep pace with the rapid increase of vehicles due to its long construction period, which leads to deteriorating traffic condition. This is almost a common problem among all the cities. Therefore, it's an effective solution for improving the traffic situation to build a traffic monitoring system with perfect functions in the city traffic management departments. The traffic monitoring system can strengthen traffic management, improve traffic capacity of the existing roads, coordinate treatment of sudden traffic incidents, ease the traffic jams and improve traffic conditions accordingly. In order to achieve effective traffic management, the monitoring system must be utilized to acquire, clear up and analyze the city traffic information and provide a traffic control strategy aiming at such data. Under the premise that the monitoring system acquires complete traffic information, how to provide the complete traffic control strategy to solve the traffic emergencies quickly and reasonably is of great importance. Ref. [2] put forward a kind of typical congestion management method under congested network condition to judging and responding with different congestion situations. Ref. [3] proposed a technique to put traffic congestion dispersion decision system into database to get congestion knowledge by using rough set theory. Ref. [4] gave a CBR distribution model for transportation network by Markus Shade. Ref. [5] proposed a traffic control system based on CBR technology which can monitor and manage traffic accidents by John L. McLin and some other people. But these researches mainly focus on emergency events with less attention on daily traffic dispersion. This paper makes the congestion management experience to form expertise knowledge library by using case reasoning to propose a management method to deal with daily traffic dispersion. 2 System framework of traffic monitoring and management platform and case based reasoning process 2.1 System framework of traffic monitoring and management platform In order to make traffic management more reasonable, the designed traffic monitoring system consists of the following modules: (1) Traffic information acquisition module, which is mainly used for acquiring road traffic information by the monitoring cameras arranged on the road, including vehicle license plate, vehicle type, traffic flow and weather situation. It is generally the acquisition process of daily information. (2) Emergency scene information capture module, which is mainly used for further acquiring road emergency information quickly under the premise that the normal traffic information is acquired, including weather condition, traffic flow, road information, emergency property and scope of influence. (3) Human-computer interface module, which is used for completing representation and result display of human-computer interaction and emergencies and inspecting matching of the input parameters to determine their weights. It will remind users timely if necessary parameters are unavailable. It further includes: ① a preprocessing module which analyzes the issues submitted by the users and converts them into the information source of CBR processing unit for accident handling; ② a vocabulary and syntax database which contains relevant vocabularies and basic grammars in this field for calling by the preprocessing module; ③ a vocabulary and grammar expansion interface which is used for updating the vocabulary and syntax database. (4) Emergency modeling module, which is used for building a scene module specific to parameter information matching of the human-computer interface module. (5) Aid decision making module, which is used for forming a case rapidly according to the built model to perform case retrieval, find the matched case, modify the matched case according to the scene conditions and find the optimum time solution. (6) Database module, which contains three sub-databases of a law base, a model base and a case base, providing corresponding support respectively specific to the above different modules. See Fig. 1 for the specific system framework. 2.2 Reasoning process of aid decision making method based on case-based reasoning From Table 1 , the aid decision making module is comparatively important in the system framework of the whole management platform and is the key process to resolve traffic emergencies reasonably. The article introduces the case based reasoning into the aid decision making module to acquire a solution and analyzes the current problem by utilizing the existing case to find out the best way to solve the problem. Case based reasoning (CBR) [1] is a novel reasoning mode emerging in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years, also an important knowledge learning and solution deducing method. CBR refers to the process that the similar case in the existing knowledge base is searched when there is a new case, and applied into the environment of the new case to acquire parameters matched with the new case and modify the parameters according to the new case to form parameter types consistent with the new case finally and deduce the new case result. Generally, the typical CBR case analysis solving process includes four steps [6]: Retrieve [7]: retrieve the case or case set most similar to the case set from the cases; Reuse: reuse the centralized case information and knowledge in the target case set in the new case; Revise [8]: in case of large difference between the previous case in the case base and the question to be solved of the target case, revise the previous case to adapt to the current target case question and obtain the new solution of the question to be solved; Retain [9]: retain the new solution of the current question to be solved into the case base for future use. See Fig. 1 for its working process: The CBR working process is shown as Fig. 1: a new question to be solved appears, the target case appears. The description of the target case question is utilized to retrieve a similar case in the case base to further obtain a source case similar to the target case and find a solution for solving the new question in the source case [10]; if the solution cannot solve the new case, the case should be revised to obtain a new source case capable of solving the target case, and the new source case is saved in the case base after the target case is solved successfully. In this article, the current question or condition is called the target case while the previous question or condition is called the source case. According to the “4R” model [11] proposed by foreign scholars Aamodt, Plaza, et al. [12], Fig. 2 shows the reasoning process of the aid decision making method based on case based reasoning by combining the actual condition of secondary recognition and testing (Fig. 3 ). 3 Case structure and representation of aid decision making Case base construction must follow a certain rule to form a relatively standardized structure. Generally case base construction should be favorable for case retrieval, knowledge organization, case base maintenance and management and knowledge expansion. According to relevant technical features of traffic monitoring and monitoring capture image information processing requirement, cases having a certain effect on solving of the traffic emergencies are selected from the existing traffic emergencies to form the case base. The case base structure can be shown as C = ( c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , c 4 , c 5 , c 6 , c 7 , c 8 , c 9 ) , wherein c1 is the Traffic peak, including early peak, latte peak and peak peace;c2 is the emergency type, mainly including traffic accident, traffic jam, natural disaster, mass disturbance, emergency secret service event and other relevant emergencies; c3 is the event location, mainly including four levels of expressway, trunk road, secondary main road and branch; c4 is the weather condition, generally including several typical weathers of sunny, foggy, thundery, sandstorm and snowy days; c5 is the traffic area affected by the event, mainly the road condition affected by the emergencies, including three effects of dot, line and plane according to the road area affected by the event; c6 is the casualty of the emergencies, which refers to the interval range of the casualty; c7 is the number of vehicles destroyed in the emergencies, which mainly refers to the interval range of the number of vehicles destroyed in the emergencies; c8 is the emergency aid decision making solution; c9 is the handling effect. The typical attribute characteristics of the cases in the case base are represented, as shown in Fig. 4 ; the values and attribute types of the characteristic attributes in the case base are shown as follows in Table 1. Construction of the aid decision making case base of the emergency is the key point of the whole reasoning system. The characteristic attributes contained in the case base are the necessary conditions for solving the traffic emergencies. The final effect evaluation of traffic emergency handling is performed in accordance with the handling efficiency and handling cost after implementation of the decision solution. 4 Case retrieval strategy Case retrieval is a key core problem to achieve case based reasoning. The case retrieval means to find the similar case in the case base according to the question description of the target case by utilizing the index and organization structure of the case base. Some popular retrieval methods in the CBR include the nearest neighbor method, the inductive retrieval method and the knowledge guiding method. This article adopts the nearest neighbor method to retrieve the case. This article adopts an overall and local similarity calculation integrating method. The calculation between the target case and the source case is utilized as the overall calculation while the attribute similarity calculation inside the case serves as the local calculation. There are multiple attribute types inside the case. Here the similarities of the attributes of various types are calculated separately. 4.1 Local similarity 4.1.1 Enumerated attribute similarity It's simple to calculate the enumerated attribute similarity, mainly by comparing attribute values of two cases. The similarity is 1 if the values are identical, otherwise it is 0. Assume the kth attributes of two cases C i and C j are enumerated attributes, the equation is shown as follows: (1) s i m ( C i k , C j k ) = 1 , C i k = C j k 0 , C i k ≠ C j k 4.1.2 Numerical attribute similarity The difference between the same numerical attribute of different cases reflects the distance between the two cases, with the similarity calculated as follows: (2) s i m ( C i k , C j k ) = C i k − C j k max k − min k Wherein max k and min k are the maximum and the minimum of the kth attributes in the cases. 4.1.3 Fuzzy attribute similarity The interval-type attribute can be represented by the fuzzy interval numbers. Assume the kth attribute G i k of the case C i is in the numerical interval type, G i k means the fuzzy interval number is G i k − , G i k + , wherein G i k − and G i k + are respectively the lower limiting value and the upper limiting value of the interval; similarly, the fuzzy interval number of the kth attribute G j k of the case C j is G j k − , G j k + , the similarity between the kth attributes of the cases C i and C j is calculated as follows: (3) s i m ( C i h , C j k ) = 1 - D ( C i h − C j k ) = 1 − 1 2 ( G i k − − G i k + ) 2 + ( G j k − − G j k + ) 2 Wherein: D ( C i h , C j k ) is the average Euclidean distance on the kth attributes of the cases C i and C j , and D ( C i h , C j k ) ∈ 0 , 1 4.2 Overall similarity After calculation of the similarity of the case attributes, the similarity between the cases and the overall similarity can be calculated. Suppose the case has h characteristic attributes, because the attributes contribute to the overall similarity of the case in different degrees, the similarity between the two cases is: (4) s i m ( C i , C j ) = ∑ k = 1 h q i ( C i k , C j k ) Wherein: q i is the weight of the ith attribute of the case, and ∑ k = 1 h q i  = 1. 5 Example analysis Take one city as an example, take a captured traffic accident of the traffic monitoring system as an example, suppose the traffic accident to be the target case K, its case index attribute values are as follows: K= {Latte peak, Traffic accident, expressway, foggy, plane, [1–3], [2,3]}, The appropriate emergency solution is obtained by CBR. First select 10 past emergencies happening on the road section with the given threshold of 0.9, the case base structure can be represented as C = ( c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , c 4 , c 5 , c 6 , c 7 , c 8 , c 9 ) , and the generated case base is shown as Table 2 . The case similarity is calculated in the following steps: A Determine the weights of the characteristic attributes. Due to the fact that the emergency cases have diversified attributes with different importance, and the attributes should be provided with the weight coefficients according to the importance. The article adopts the analytic hierarchy process (APH) [15] to determine the weights of the attributes [13,14]: ① Build a 3-hierarchy analytic hierarchy model of a target hierarchy, a criterion hierarchy and a project hierarchy. The target hierarchy describes the emergency describing demand; the criterion hierarchy tests the emergency case selection standard and requirements correspondingly, mainly including the testing demand index attribute content in the case frame; the project hierarchy corresponds to the emergency case set provided by the case base. ② Determine the weight of the criterion relative to the target by comparing the index attributes in the criterion hierarchy [16], i.e. to build the case attribute judgment matrix; then calculate the judgment matrix maximum characteristic value and its corresponding characteristic vector, and utilize the consistency index to perform consistency test on the judgment matrix. If the test is passed, the characteristic vector subject to normalization processing is the weight set of the corresponding attributes. See Table 3 for the weights: B Calculate the local similarity [17,18], i.e. the similarity of the index attributes between the cases, and calculate the similarity of the attributes respectively according to the Eqs. (1)–(Fig. 3). C After acquiring the local similarity, calculate the similarity between the target case K and the source cases according to the Eq. (4). The calculation results are shown as Table 4 : From Table 4, the case 9 in the case base has the highest similarity with the target case among all the calculation results, with the similarity exceeding the given threshold 0.8, indicating that the target case K is most similar to the source case 9. Therefore, the emergency handling scheme 10 in the source case 9 can be used to handle the current emergency (traffic accident). In case the handling scheme is unsatisfactory, the case 9 can be revised according to the actual condition till reaching a satisfactory handling effect. 6 Conclusion Based on the traffic information captured by the urban traffic monitoring system, the road traffic emergencies were analyzed and handled. First, the article built the system framework of the traffic monitoring system and proposed the traffic aid decision making method based on CBR. Second, the article built the traffic emergency case base to analyze the target case and source cases in the case base and adopted the overall-local characteristic attribute similarity calculating method to calculate the similarity between the cases reasonably. Finally, the cases indicate that by using CBR to calculate similarity between cases with similarity comparison for traffic congestion management, a solution to the problem of traffic congestion could be found. Meanwhile, by adjusting and correcting the successful cases, it improves the speed of reasoning solution and satisfies the real-time requirements of traffic congestion management to solve the traffic dispersion problem with certain guiding significance.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.196,Focusing light through scattering media using the harmony search algorithm for phase optimization of wavefront shaping,"Abstract Utilizing the wavefront shaping technique to focus light through a scattering medium is a newly emerging field and has shown great potential for various applications. A critical task in this field is identifying a fast, robust algorithm for wavefront shaping. In this work, we introduce a simple-structure algorithm, the harmony search (HS) algorithm, for use in the phase optimization of wavefront shaping. We experimentally demonstrate that HS converges faster than the continuous sequential algorithm (CSA) and reaches a higher overall enhancement. In addition, we establish a simulation model based on random matrix theory. The numerical simulation results agree well with the experimental results and show that the HS algorithm is more resistant than the CSA to noise and sample decoherence.",Apr-18," Keywords Scattering material Wavefront shaping Harmony search algorithm 1 Introduction When light propagates through scattering materials, such as paper and biological tissue, it is scattered by sub-wavelength particles in all directions and forms a random speckle pattern. Multiple scattering events make these materials opaque; as a result, focusing or imaging through a scattering medium was once thought to be impossible. However, in 2007, Vellekoop and Mosk [1] experimentally demonstrated that instead of scattering into a random speckle pattern, coherent light can be focused into a sharp, intense point through scattering materials by using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to compensate the phase distortion of the incident wavefront. Since then, this method, which is called the wavefront shaping technique, has drawn a tremendous amount of interest, and numerous potential applications have been demonstrated in various areas, including light polarization control [2,3], optical trapping [4], super-resolution imaging [5,6], fluorescence imaging [7], and deep tissue microscopy [8,9]. For the wavefront shaping technique, finding a fast, robust optimization algorithm that can compensate for the phase distortion of the incident wavefront is critical. Two basic approaches are currently being adopted in the research of optimizing the phase of the incident wavefront: the transmission matrix (TM) approach and the iterative optimization (IA) approach. The TM approach directly measures the transmission matrix of the scattering medium through an interference method and calculates the phase pattern applied to the modulator using the obtained TM [10]. The IA approach achieves focusing by adjusting the input wavefront according to the feedback signal from the intended point in the output plane [11,12]. The TM approach updates the phase pattern only when all measurements are completed, while the IA approach adjusts the phase pattern during each measurement. Therefore, one of the greatest strengths of IA is its good performance under noisy and decoherence environments, which is important to realizing real-time dynamic focusing and imaging. Thus, several reports have been published that identify a fast, robust phase optimization algorithm for IA, including the continuous sequential algorithm (CSA) [11], the stepwise sequential algorithm [11], the partitioning algorithm [11], and the genetic algorithm (GA) [12]. Among these algorithms, CSA and GA are two best-performing and widely used algorithms. As the CSA independently optimizes each input mode, it has a simple structure; however, the enhancement approaches the theoretical maximum more slowly than that of GA and is more sensitive to environmental noise and sample vibrations. In contrast, GA converges faster and performs better, especially in noisy and vibrating environments; however, it suffers from a complex structure. To obtain a faster, more robust algorithm with a simple computation and structure, we propose a harmony search (HS) algorithm to optimize the phase of the wavefront because HS is easy to implement and has been demonstrated to handle optimization problems with a small number of candidates [13]. In this paper, we first describe the operation of the HS algorithm for phase optimization in detail. Then, phase optimization experiments are employed to compare the overall enhancement and convergence speed of HS and CSA. Finally, we build a simulation model to quantitatively study the resistance of the two algorithms to noise and decoherence. 2 Harmony search algorithms applied to phase mask optimization Inspired by harmony improvisation, the HS algorithm was first proposed by Geem [14,15] to solve the optimization problem of water distribution networks. Since then, HS has been widely applied to various optimization problems, including transportation, manufacturing, robotics, and medical science. Fig. 1 depicts the flow chart of the HS algorithm for phase optimization of wavefront shaping. First, we generate an n-dimensional HS memory (HM), which is represented as follows: (1) H M = φ 1 1 , φ 2 1 , ... , φ n 1 φ 1 2 , φ 2 2 , ... , φ n 2 ... φ 1 H M S , φ 2 H M S , ... , φ n H M S where φ 1 i , φ 2 i , ... , φ n i ( i = 1 , 2 , ... , H M S ) is a phase mask applied to the SLM, n is the number of the controlled segments of the SLM, and HMS is the size of the HM. The algorithm updates the HM using the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of the intended area in a camera as feedback. In each generation, the HS generates a new phase mask in three ways: harmony memory usage, random search and pitch adjustment. Harmony memory usage involves randomly selecting a solution in the HM with a probability equal to the harmony memory considering rate (HMCR) and with a probability equal to 1-HMCR, the random search creates a new random solution. After selecting the solution, the HS algorithm adjusts the pitch according to Eq. (2), adjusting the variable with a probability equal to pitch adjusting rate (PAR). (2) φ n e w = φ o l d + B W * ( 2 r a n d − 1 ) where rand is a number from the uniform pseudorandom distribution from 0 to 1, and BW is the bandwidth of the adjustment. We use the variables HMCR, BW and PAR, which change dynamically with generation numbers: (3) H M C R ( g e n e r a t i o n ) = H M C R min + H M C R max − H M C R min N I * g e n e r a t i o n (4) P A R ( g e n e r a t i o n ) = P A R max exp ln P A R min / P A R max N I * g e n e r a t i o n (5) B W ( g e n e r a t i o n ) = B W max exp ln ( b w min / b w max ) N I * g e n e r a t i o n where NI is the total number of iterative procedures, and generation is the generation number. HMCR takes a linear form, and PAR and BW change into exponential forms [16]. In the early generations, BW and PAR are large, and HMCR is small to force the HS algorithm to increase the diversity of the solutions, whereas in the final generations, smaller BW and PAR and a larger HMCR enable the algorithm to converge to the optimal solution. 3 Scattering model As light transport through scattering media is a linear system, it can be described using a transmission matrix model: (6) E m = ∑ n t m n E n where n is the mode of the incident field E n , m is the index of the transmitted field E m , and t m n is the transmission matrix element of the scattering media and follows the circular Gaussian random distribution. To acquire the transmission properties of the TM, we apply the singular value decomposition (SVD) to the TM: (7) T = U Σ V ∗ where * denotes the transpose conjugate, and U and V are unitary matrices. U links the transmission channel output modes with the output free modes, and V links the input free modes with the transmission channel input modes. Σ is a diagonal matrix with positive values, the squares of which are called the transmission eigenvalues. The density of the transmission eigenvalues determines the possibility waves transmitting through multiple scattering media for each input mode. In theory, the TM follows a bimodal distribution; however, in experiments, because of the incomplete channel control, it follows a Marchenko-Pastur distribution [17]. (8) ρ λ ˜ = γ 2 π λ ˜ λ ˜ 2 − λ ˜ min 2 λ ˜ max 2 − λ ˜ 2 ∀ λ ˜ ∈ λ ˜ min , λ ˜ max where γ is the input/output asymmetric ratio M / N , λ ˜ min = 1 − 1 / γ is the smallest singular value, and λ ˜ max = 1 + 1 / γ is the maximum singular value. 4 Experimental results The HS algorithm was tested using the experimental setup depicted in Fig. 2 . A linearly polarized light (5 mW, 632.8 nm He-Ne laser), whose polarization direction was in accordance with the phase-only modulation orientation of the SLM (Holoeye PLUTO VIS), was expanded by a 10× beam expander (L1 and L2) and then spatially modulated by the SLM with phase-only modulation. Next, the shaped beam was focused onto the scattering sample (a ground glass diffuser) using lens L3 with a focal length of 45 mm. A 40× objective with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.65 collected the transmitted light through the ground glass diffuser and imaged the scattering pattern onto an 8-bit charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (ImageSource DMK-21BU04) with a 200 mm focal length lens (L4). The SBR of the intensity of the centre of the CCD was used to provide a feedback signal to the optimization algorithm. By grouping sets of pixels together, the SLM was divided into a variable number of square segments, N. Fig. 3 (a)–(c) show pictures captured with the CCD camera before HS optimization, after HS optimization with N = 256, and after HS optimization with N = 1024, respectively. Before HS optimization, the transmitted intensity pattern on the CCD camera shows a random speckle pattern. After HS optimizations, the transmitted intensity patterns are dominated by a bright spot at the target point, and optimization with 1024 segments shows a brighter focus than optimization with 256 segments. These results demonstrate that HS can effectively focus light through the scattering sample. The modulation pictures projected onto the SLM for Fig. 3(b) and (c) are depicted in (d) and (e), respectively. Unlike the CSA algorithm, which has discrete phase choices for only one mode (in this case, we chose 8 phase steps), HS expands the phase search scope because the SLM can display grey levels ranging from 0 to 255. To test the performance of the proposed HS algorithm, experiments for focusing through scattering media were performed with control segments on the SLMs with 256 and 1024 segments. Fig. 4 compares the performance of the HS algorithm with that of the CSA algorithm. Each curve is averaged over five runs. To better compare the two algorithms, the number of iterations for HS was set to be 8 × N, which is equivalent to the number of phase mask measurements for the CSA. The enhancement is defined as the ratio between the SBRs before and after phase optimization. As shown in Fig. 4, the HS algorithm converged faster than the CSA and reached a higher overall enhancement when the incident wavefront was divided into 256 (Fig. 4(a)) and 1024 (Fig. 4(b)) controlling modes. To reach the same enhancement as CSA, HS required 600 generations, which was 23% of that for CSA under N = 256 circumstances. For N = 1024, HS converges even faster, requiring only 14% of the measurements required by CSA to reach the same enhancement as that of CSA. Furthermore, HS reached a 1.75 times (N = 256) and 3 times (N = 1024) higher overall enhancement than CSA. Thus, the HS algorithm converged faster and obtained a higher overall enhancement than the CSA algorithm for this experimental configuration, especially when the segments became larger. 5 Simulations To quantitatively analyse the effects of noise and decoherence on the performance and effectiveness of the HS and CSA algorithms, we develop a simulation model based on transmission matrix theory. We first generate a random matrix following a circular Gaussian distribution and then reconstruct the eigenvalues to obey the Marchenko-Pastur law. Next, measurement noise is simulated by adding a Gaussian random value to the simulated detector signal. Finally, sample decoherence is included by repeatedly adding a small perturbation, which follows a complex Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation δ to each of the matrix elements. The results of the simulations for the HS algorithm are shown in Fig. 5 . Similar to the experimental results, before HS optimization, the output field (Fig. 5(a)) shows a random pattern. After HS optimization, the intended point of the output field (Fig. 5(b–c)) shows a clear spot, and the enhancement increases with the increasing number of segments. To validate the effectiveness of the simulation model, the simulation results of HS and CSA under a given experimental noise level are compared in Fig. 6 . We set the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurement noise to 10 dB, which approximates the SNR during the optical experimental measurements. The figure reveals that the simulation results agree well with the experimental results. The HS optimization converges faster and reaches a larger overall enhancement than the CSA optimization. Because the simulations capture the overall behaviour of the algorithms very well, we can use them to estimate cases with considerable noise and strong decoherence. Fig. 7 shows the simulated enhancements versus measurement noise levels for both algorithms. According to the figure, except for the low-noise condition (SNR > 22 dB), HS clearly performs better than the CSA; even when the CSA loses effectiveness, HS still has an enhancement of 77.3 (HMS = 30) and 31.5 (HMS = 5) when the SNR is 0 dB. In addition, we computed the searching ability for different values of HMS. HMS with values of 5 and 30 are presented with a black dashed line and circle markers and a blue dashed line and square markers, respectively. Fig. 7 shows that a larger HMS performs better under high-noise conditions, whereas a smaller HMS exhibits a higher enhancement under low-noise conditions. The parameter values used in various simulations and experiments are presented in Table 1 . Fig. 8 shows the simulated enhancements of the algorithms under different decoherence conditions on a logarithmic scale. The persistence time T p is defined as T p = T i / δ 2 , where T i is the iteration measurement time [11]. In Fig. 8, the enhancement clearly decreases for both algorithms with the decreasing persistence time T p . The CSA algorithm performs well when the persistence time is long, but as the persistence time decreases, the enhancement quickly drops to zero. Although the HS algorithm leads to a relatively smaller enhancement than CSA when T p is large, it loses efficiency slowly and achieves an enhancement of 65.4, whereas CSA generates an enhancement of 4.2 and loses efficiency. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, we proposed the HS algorithm for the phase optimization of wavefront shaping, and we experimentally and numerically evaluated the performance and effectiveness of the algorithm. We experimentally demonstrated that the HS algorithm achieved focusing through scattering materials faster and generated a higher overall enhancement than the CSA algorithm at a SNR of 10. We also established a simulation model to evaluate the resistance of the algorithms to noise and decoherence. The simulation results indicated that HS achieves faster convergence speed and better enhancement than CSA, especially in high-noise environments and fluctuating circumstances. With its simple structure, the HS algorithm achieves a larger enhancement, faster convergence and stronger robustness than the CSA algorithm, indicating its promise for controlling light through scattering materials.

The system can intelligently test the design of LED lighting system, realize the intensity of light control, infrared detection and the measurement of light intensity, reflecting the intelligence and humanity of LED lights, and further to achieve energy-saving green lighting.",Apr-18," Keywords Single chip microcomputer LED Intelligent lighting Sensor Photoelectric detection 1 Introduction LED is the fourth generation of green lighting light source, has been widely used in all aspects of social life due to its low energy consumption, high photosynthetic efficiency, no pollution, long service life etc. [1–3]. With the development of science and technology, the people’s demand for lighting is continuously improved. The lighting not only could provide a comfortable environment brightness, but also build elegant and comfortable atmosphere. At present, as for indoor lighting, the application of LED intelligent lighting system is still in the exploratory stage and in the exploratory stage. The reason is that is the lighting technology and application cost. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop a set of feasible low-cost lighting management system solving the current urgent need of the defaults in lighting system, which s also a critical issue in the field of current lighting control [4–6]. The aim of this work is to design a kind of intelligent LED lighting system based on STC89C52 MCU minimum system, which combining with the LED lighting technology, infrared sensing technology [7], photoelectric detection technology [8] and intelligent control technology [9] et al. The system can realize intelligent control on the brightness of the lamp, not only for daily lighting needs, and but also have played an important role in saving energy. 2 The system hardware design The system design is based on single chip microcomputer minimum system, mainly including human pyroelectric infrared sensing, optical sensing, key presses, display module, so as to realize the adjusting the brightness of the light automatically, as shown in Fig. 1 . 2.1 Minimum MCU system The minimum MCU system includes crystal vibration circuit and reset circuit, its principle diagram is shown in Fig. 2 . The internal clock pulse signal was produced by a 12 MHZ crystal vibration and two 30 pf ceramics external clock oscillation circuit of capacitance picked up in XTAL1 (19 feet) and XTAL2 (20 feet) of MCU by STC89C52 chip. The typical values of 12 MHz or 11.0592 MHz were allowed in STC89C52 chip and 12MHz was used in this system. When the system falls into a dead loop in the execution of a program, the MCU may use the reset button at this time and let the internal procedure from the beginning. In this work, the manual reset and power on reset was combined. Usually a reset button was added between RST (9 feet) and power supply VCC, two ends of reset button was parallel connection with a 10 uf electrolytic capacitors, the parallel series after a 10 k resistor and connect to the ground, so as to form a reset circuit. 2.2 Pyroelectric infrared sensor module The HC - SR501 body heat release electric induction module was used to design infrared sensor module because of its high sensitivity and reliability. If someone appear in the sensing area, the signal output level, clockwise adjust potentiometer of delay time, the delay time, when people leave the induction area, intelligent lighting system will delay setting time, the intelligent lighting system will automatically shut down. 2.3 Light intensity sensor module BH1750FVI chip was adopted in light intensity sensor module, which can realize detection 1 l x - 65535 l x range of light intensity, according to different light environment to adjust the brightness of the lighting system and achieve the right lighting environment. BH1750FVI have two feet to received a single chip microcomputer, and through a 10 k resistor connected to the power supply, including SCL (4 feet) received the MCU clock end P1.6 port, used to pull up, pull down the clock line to the data SDA (3 feet) from MCU P1.7 port, used to send data, read data, the wiring diagram is shown in Fig. 3 . 2.4 LED lighting module 40 mA and 0.2 W LED light was adopted in the lighting module. In order to adjust the brightness of the light to achieve energy saving, PWM wave was used to change the current for so that the brightness of the LED lights change. Fig. 4 shows the LED control circuit diagram. From Fig. 4, the output of dimming signal could be realized by the connection between the end of light and P1.1 port of MCU. With the change of the duty cycle, the current also changed, and the different brightness display of light can be obtained, eventually achieve the result of dimming. 3 The system software design The master control module can be displayed on the LCD by measuring the light intensity operated by the metering module. If the button is pressed, LCD display the intelligent mode, on the contrary, for manual mode. The human induction module can induction someone, when someone, the light whether need turned on according to the light of the state. On the state of light, automatic adjusting light can be realized in automatic mode and manul adjusting light can be realized by key module in manual mode. The light turn off when in the condition of no one. Fig. 5 shows the main module flow chart. 3.1 Interrupt program Fig. 6 shows the flow chart of time 0. The PWM was produced by timer 0 and so as to light automatically adjusting according to the outside world based on smart mode. Fig. 7 shows the flow chart of time 1. Time 1 is used in a state of turning on the light. When people go and start counting and delay 10s automatically turn off the lights. 3.2 Liquid crystal display (LCD) module The LCD module can display four lines of numbers, The light intensity, whether to detect people, the lamp working mode and working condition were displayed from the first to fourth lines, respectively. The flow chart of LCD was shown in Fig. 8 . 3.3 Dimming module Intelligent lamp is divided into intelligent dimming and manual dimming lights under turning on the light and is divided into 4 stalls, representing different brightness. Fig. 9 shows the flow chart of intelligent mode. The automatic dimming can be realized according to the change of light intensity under the intelligent model. The brightness of the lamp will automatically change the corresponding gear brightness when the light intensity in the corresponding test set intensity range. Fig. 10 shows the flow chart of manual mode.When the key K2 was pressed, the mode is manual. And the dimming can be manually adjusted according to the needs. The key K3 is turn on or off the lights. The key K4 is increased brightness.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.182,Effect of q-parameter on relativistic self-focusing of q-Gaussian laser beam in plasma,"Abstract The exponential function in an expression of intensity profile of Gaussian laser beam has been replaced by algebraic function having q exponent in it. In preliminary theoretical investigations, it has been observed that q -Gaussian intensity distribution function plays vital role in the dynamics of laser beam propagating in relativistic plasma. In present theoretical investigation, the usual parabolic equation approach under paraxial and WKB approximations has been adopted, taking into account relativistic nonlinearity. We have established the nonlinear differential equation for the beam-width parameter f and solved it numerically by using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The effect of q parameter on the variation of beam width parameter f with normalized distance of propagation ξ has been presented graphically and discussed.",Apr-18," Keywords q-Gaussian Relativistic Self-focusing Plasma 1 Introduction In the interaction of ultra-high intensity laser beams with plasmas, the phenomenon of self-focusing of laser beams occupies a unique place due to its relevance to potential applications such as fast-ignition schemes for inertial confinement thermonuclear fusion [1], laser electron acceleration [2,3], x-ray sources [4], harmonic generation [5,6] etc. In all these applications, it is enviable that the high intensity laser beam should propagate in controlled manner while keeping its efficient interaction over a long distance with plasma. As such, propagation of laser beams through plasmas up to several Rayleigh lengths is an essential prerequisite for the feasibility of all these applications. Therefore, there have been ongoing efforts to explore the methods or processes that may support to increase the efficiency of laser-plasma coupling. Laser–plasma interaction is perennially burdened with copious nonlinear effects. This spans the gamut to many self-action effects such as self-focusing [7]. When an intense laser beam is shone into a plasma, it changes its dielectric properties. The subsequent variation of the light’s velocity across the beam’s wave front causes them to bend into medium, causing self-focusing of the laser beam [8]. The phenomenon of self-focusing is such a nonlinear optical self-action effect that averts the diffraction broadening of the laser beam. In the interaction of high power of the beams with plasmas, the quiver velocity of plasma electrons becomes comparable to that of light in the free space. This causes significant increase in the mass of plasma electrons that in turn alters the dielectric function of plasma. This is one of the typical mechanisms, which is generally known as relativistic-self-focusing of laser beams. Such type of nonlinearity sets in periods of the order of ω p − 1 , where ω p is the plasma frequency. In recent years, the field of laser-plasma interaction in the relativistic regime has been identified as a promising area of research. In this emerging era, phenomenon of self-focusing occupies a unique position due to its relevance to all other phenomena in the field of laser-plasma interaction. Hora [9] described the detailed mechanism of self-focusing of laser beam that occurs in a homogeneous plasma. It is based solely on the relativistic dependence of the optical constants on laser irradiance. Hauser et al. [10] have presented the analytical calculation of relativistic self-focusing length of intense laser beam propagating into a plasma under WKB approximation. Relativistic self-focusing of laser beams of arbitrary intensity in plasmas has been employed by Asthana et al. [11]. Feit et al. [12] have presented the description of relativistic self-focusing of laser beam in underdense plasma. They have emphasized the importance of electron cavitation in suppression of the possibility of channel power well above the critical power of self-focusing for a distance of many Rayleigh lengths. Gupta et al. [13] have presented the relativistic effect on stimulated Raman scattering of a laser in plasma. Plasma density ramp for relativistic self-focusing of laser has been elaborated by Gupta et al. [14]. Dynamics of Gaussian spikes on Gaussian laser beam in relativistic plasma has been described by Singh et al. [15]. Patil et al. [16] have explored the ponderomotive and weakly relativistic self-focusing in the interaction of Gaussian laser beam in plasma. Gupta et al. [17] have explored the laser pulse distortion in a plasma of the weakly relativistic regime. Patil et al. [18] studied the effect of light absorption on relativistic self-focusing of Gaussian laser beam in plasma. In current studies [19–24], it has been observed that quantum effects in plasmas can significantly enhance relativistic self-focusing in comparison to the classical relativistic case of reference. A review of literature highlights the fact that most of above-mentioned studies have been carried out by considering fundamental Gaussian irradiance distribution along the wavefront of the beam. Nevertheless, few studies have been done on relativistic self-focusing of super-Gaussian beams [25], hollow-Gaussian beams [26], cosh-Gaussian beams [27], Hermite-Gaussian beams [28], Hermite-cosh-Gaussian beams [29], quadruple Gaussian beams [30] etc. Apart from these, a great interest has recently been evinced on optical beams suggesting a long-tailed beam profile, usually known as q - Gaussian beam. It is interesting to note that the intensity profile of the Vulcan petawatt laser has been found to be deviating from Gaussian intensity distribution [31]. The suggested intensity profile of such distribution that gives justice to the experimental data observed in laboratory has q Gaussian distribution. One must note that for a given power of laser beam, the average square of electric vector in the wavefront is much higher in case of q Gaussian irradiance profile as compared to Gaussian irradiance. Sharma and Kourakis [32] pointed out the narrowing nature of beam for higher q values. Singh and Gupta highlighted the significance of the interaction of q Gaussian laser beams with plasmas for second harmonic generation [33]. In present paper we have studied relativistic self-focusing effect of q-Gaussian laser beam in plasma by adopting usual parabolic equation approach under the paraxial and WKB approximations. In Section 2, intensity distribution of input q Gaussian laser beam and relativistic dielectric function of plasma is presented. The second order nonlinear differential equation governing the propagation dynamics of the laser beam in plasma is obtained in Section 3. The discussion of results is presented in Section 4 and finally a brief conclusion is added in Section 5. 2 Theoretical considerations The intensity distribution of the q Gaussian laser beam along its wavefront at the plane of incidence ( z = 0 ) is given by [29] (1) E E ∗ = E 0 2 1 + r 2 q r 0 2 − q where E 0 is the axial amplitude of the laser beam at z = 0 , r 0 is the initial spot size of the laser beam, and q is a parameter associated with deviation of intensity profile of laser beam from Gaussian distribution. Fig. 1 illustrates the normalized intensity profile of the laser beam for different values of q . Note that small values of q are characterized by a long tail, while as q increases towards higher values, the distribution becomes Gaussian for q → ∞ , i.e., (2) lim q → ∞ E E ∗ = E 0 2 exp − r 2 r 0 2 When such high intensity q Gaussian laser beams propagate through plasmas, the effect of transverse quiver motion of plasma electrons changes and the electron mass is modified by the relativistic effects, which eventually affects the expression for plasma dielectric function which can be written as (3) ε = 1 − Ω 2 γ where Ω = ω p / ω , γ = 1 + α E E ∗ 1 / 2 is the Lorentz relativistic factor with α = e 2 / m 0 2 ω 2 c 2 as coefficient of relativistic nonlinearity. Here, e and m 0 are the charge and rest mass of electron; respectively, ω is the frequency of laser beam and c is the speed of light in free space. One can formally express the dielectric function of plasma as [8] (4) ε = ε 0 + φ E E ∗ where ε 0 and φ are linear and nonlinear parts of dielectric function respectively. 3 Propagation dynamics of laser beam The wave equation governing the electric field E of the beam in plasmas with the dielectric function given by Eq. (4) can be written as (5) ∇ 2 E − ∇ ∇ ⋅ E + ω 2 c 2 ε E = 0 Even if E has longitudinal components, the polarization terms ∇ ∇ ⋅ E of Eq. (5) can be neglected; provided ( c 2 / ω 2 ) | ( 1 / ε ) ∇ 2 ln ε | < < 1 . Introducing E = A ( r , z ) exp ( − i k 0 z ) in Eq. (5), the behavior of complex amplitude A ( r , z ) A r , z is can be described by the parabolic equation in the WKB approximation as (6) 2 i k 0 ∂ A ∂ z + ∇ ⊥ 2 A + ω 2 c 2 φ E E ∗ A = 0 In the absence of any spikes, one can express (7) A = A 0 ( r , z ) exp ( − i k 0 S ) A = A 0 r , z e x p - i k S , ( 10 ) where A 0 and S are real functions of r and z ( S being the eikonal of the beam). Substituting for A in Eq. (6) and separating real and imaginary parts, we obtain (8) 2 ∂ S ∂ z + ∂ S ∂ r 2 = 1 k 0 2 A 0 ∇ ⊥ 2 A 0 + ω p 2 ω 2 ε 0 1 − 1 + α E E ∗ − 1 / 2 (9) ∂ A 0 2 ∂ z + ∂ A 0 2 ∂ r ∂ S ∂ r + A 0 2 ∂ 2 S ∂ r 2 + 1 r ∂ S ∂ r = 0 Following the paraxial approach given by Akhmanov et al. [7], and extended by Sodha et al. [8], solutions of Eqs. (8) and (9) for q Gaussian laser beam propagating along z axis is given by (10) S = r 2 2 f d f d z + ψ z (11) A 0 2 = E 0 2 f 2 1 + r 2 q r 0 2 f 2 − q where ψ z is the axial phase and the function f = f z is known as dimensionless beam-width parameter governed by following differential equation (12) d 2 f d ξ 2 = 4 + q q f 3 − ρ 0 2 Ω 2 P 0 2 f 3 1 + P 0 f 2 − 3 2 where ρ 0 = r 0 ω / c is the normalized equilibrium beam radius, ξ = z / R d η = z / k r 0 2 is the dimensionless distance of propagation with R d = k 0 r 0 2 as the Rayleigh length, P 0 = α E 0 2 is the initial intensity parameter. Eq. (12) can be solved numerically with appropriate boundary conditions. For an initially plane wavefront at ξ = 0 , f = 1 and d f / d ξ = 0. 4 Results and discussion Eq. (12) is the second-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation governing the behaviour of beam-width parameter f as a function of dimensionless distance of propagation ξ . It is to be noted that at q → ∞ , Eq. (12) reduces to f parameter differential equation for relativistic self-focusing of Gaussian laser beam in plasma as obtained earlier [15,18]. Since the analytical solution of Eq. (12) is not possible, we have solved this equation numerically by using Runge-Kutta fourth order method for following laser-plasma parameters; n 0 = 10 18 c m − 3 , λ = 1.06 μ m , r 0 = 20 μ m , Ω = 0.03 − 0.06 , P 0 = 1.00 − 1.30 , q = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ∞ . The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (12) is the diffraction term that appears due to the Laplacian ∇ ⊥ 2 in Eq. (6), while second term is the nonlinear term arises due to the relativistic nonlinearity. The diffraction term leads to the divergence (defocusing), while nonlinear term is responsible for convergence (focusing) of the laser beam propagating through plasma. If the magnitude of first term on right-hand side of Eq. (12) is such that d 2 f / d ξ 2 > 0 , then the beam undergoes divergence due to predominance of diffraction effect. In contrast, if the two terms are such that d 2 f / d ξ 2 < 0 , the beam undergo self-focusing. For d 2 f / d ξ 2 = 0 , the first term on right-hand side is cancelled by second term and the beam propagates with uniform waveguide / self-trapped mode. This condition is known as critical condition obtained from Eq. (12) as (13) ρ 0 2 = 2 1 + 4 / q 1 + P 0 Ω 2 P 0 3 / 2 It is to be noted that at infinite q values, one can recover the expression for critical curve derived earlier [29] for Gaussian beam under relativistic self-focusing. Fig. 2 is known as critical curve. It highlights the dependence of normalized equilibrium beam radius ρ 0 as a function of intensity parameter P 0 according to Eq. (13). It is observed that for a particular value of q parameter, ρ 0 decreases rapidly with increase in P 0 . With a further increase in P 0 , the change in ρ 0 is slightly insignificant. It is further noticed that minimum value of ρ 0 is lowest in case of Gaussian beam and with increase in q parameter, curves recovers the critical curve of Gaussian beam for q → ∞ . Thus larger spot-sized beams with lower q values can be relativistically propagated through plasma in comparison with smaller spot-sized Gaussian beam. Fig. 3 describes the variation of dimensionless beam-width parameter f with normalized distance of propagation ξ for Ω = 0.03 , P 0 = 1.00 and different q values q = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ∞ . It is observed from this figure that for above mentioned parameters, steady and oscillatory defocusing is respectively observed for q = 1 and q = 2 , while oscillatory self-focusing of f is observed for q > 2 . From this figure it is also observed that as q value increases, minimum of oscillations decreases, whereas maximum remains same and is equal to unity. As obvious, with increase in value of q , reduction in focusing length has been observed and finally for q tending towards infinity, beam recovers the stationary oscillatory self-focusing trend of f for Gaussian beam propagation in plasma. This is due to faster self-focusing of axial rays as compared to that of off-axial rays. Fig. 4 depicts the dependence of f on ξ with q = 3 for four values of normalized plasma density parameter Ω Ω = 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.05 , 0.06 and above mentioned set of parameters. From this figure it is evident that with increase in plasma density parameter, enhanced self-focusing is observed with subsequent reduction is self-focusing length as reported [15] earlier for Gaussian beam propagation in plasma. Fig. 5 describes the variation of f against ξ with q = 3 for four values of initial intensity parameter P 0 P 0 = 1.00 , 1.10 , 1.20 , 1.30 . Rest of the laser-plasma parameters are kept same as mentioned earlier. It is obvious that with increase in intensity of the laser beam, stronger self-focusing has been observed. In this case also, slight reduction in self-focusing length with distance of propagation is observed with increase in P 0 values. Similar results were also reported [15] earlier for Gaussian laser beam. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, we have explored the evolution of q -Gaussian laser beams propagating through a relativistic plasma. The equation for beam-width parameter is derived by using parabolic equation approach under paraxial and WKB approximations. Following important conclusions are drawn from present analysis: • q -Gaussian beams can be analyzed like Gaussian beam in plasma and influence of q parameter on the laser beam propagation is obvious. • Self-focusing power of q -Gaussian laser beam is lower than Gaussian beam. • Self-focusing of q -Gaussian laser beam increases with increase in plasma density parameter as well as with increase in laser intensity parameter. These results are related to various situations of laser-plasma physics. Besides its apparent relevance to inertial confinement fusion, these results can also be obliged in other applications involving laser beams with localized energy. It would be interesting to study the present analysis in extra-paraxial region of the beam which, however, to the best of our knowledge has not been presented in the literature at present. ", [1] R.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.172,Two-axis gimbal platform controller design in finite time application occasions: LMI approach,"Abstract In this paper, a controller design approach based on LMI optimization method is proposed for the two-axis gimbal platform in finite time application. This method is based on the linear parameter varying (LPV) model of the two-axis gimbal platform, considering the cross-coupling problem between the pitch and yaw channel. Firstly, the dynamic equation of the two-axis gimbal platform is analyzed and its LPV model is obtained. Then, the sufficient conditions which can ensure the LPV system is finite time bounded(FTB) are introduced, and the controller is designed accordingly. Finally, the performance of the platform with finite time controller and PI controller is analyzed qualitatively. The results show that the proposed controller can guarantee the tracking accuracy in finite time and effectively suppress the coupling interference between the pitch and yaw channel.",Apr-18," Keywords Two-axis gimbal platform Linear parameter varying state equation Finite-time boundedness LMI 1 Introduction The payload (such as IR, laser and television) has found a wide use in many important fields, for example guided missiles, tracking systems and image processing. Two-axis gimbal platform controller is used to isolate payload from disturbances. The controller is usually implemented via two loops, the outer loop called track loop and the inner loop called line of sight (LOS) stabilization loop. The typical control architecture of the two-axis gimbal platform is shown in Fig. 1 . The track loop consists of specific sensor such as image processer and image tracker. However, in most cases, the LOS stabilization loop employs a two-axis gyro in the inner frame to sense rate disturbance. The LOS stabilization loop determines the performance of the system and is the focus of the design. However, structural defects and cross-coupling between pitch and yaw channels can deteriorate the performance of platform in the condition of the base disturbance [1,2]. Controller design is based on the kinetic model of two-axis gimbal platform, which can be obtained through the Euler rigid body dynamics [3] or Lagrange equation [4]. The configuration of the sensor, which can be divided into direct method and indirect method [5], is another problem of controller design. For most two-axis gimbal platform, direct method is a common approach. After determining the configuration of the sensor, the controller can be designed based on a variety of control methods. So far, several control schemes were introduced to the two-axis gimbal platform design. PID controller and its improved form have been widely used in the controller design [6–8]. H∞ optimization approach has been regarded as an effective and efficient multivariable robust design method. Compared with the PID controller design procedure, the design procedure of H∞ can take unmodeled dynamics into consideration and effectively handle the multi-input multi-output(MIMO) systems. H∞ control is also widely used in the two-axis gimbal platform [9–11]. Sliding mode control, which is one of the nonlinear robust control methods, has been used in the LOS stabilization loop [12,13]. This method can drive the systems states from any initial state to a user-specified surface. However, the high switching gain and switching action between the different sliding mode surfaces may lead to serious chattering problem [14]. During recent years, some intelligent control strategies, such as adaptive fractional-order sliding-mode [15], fuzzy logical [16,17] and Self-Organizing Recurrent Wavelet-Neural-Network [18] were also applied in LOS stabilization loop. Sometimes, the two-axis gimbal platform only works for a limited period of time, in which case we only examine its performance during that time period. For example, missile seeker only works in the terminal guidance stage, which begins from the seeker catching a target and ends after the missile hitting the target. This example can be described with finite time stability (FTS) theory. A system is said to be FTS if, given a bound on the initial condition, its state does not exceed a certain threshold during a specified time interval [19]. On this basis, many scholars have studied the finite time stability of various conditions, such as the FTS of continuous systems with additive time-varying delays [20] and FTS for linear discrete-time system with time-varying delay [21]. Amato [22] extended the definition of FTS to the definition of finite-time boundedness (FTB) and provided a sufficient condition guaranteeing FTB via state feedback. For finite-time control problems of linear systems subject to time-varying parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbance, a synthesis method based on minimizing a linear objective with LMI constraints was presented in [23]. Most of these researches put forward controller based on the model of azimuth axis while the elevation angle was kept fixed, cross moments of inertia were taken to zero and the disturbance from the roll axis of the basement were neglected. When the roll angular velocity of the basement is not zero, the system dynamics and operational conditions will change. So the performance of two-axis gimbal platform with a controller based on single axis model will deteriorate under high dynamic circumstances. To improve control performance, we adopt the LPV model to design the LOS stabilization loop controller in the finite time application. Based on the sufficient condition of FTB, we can get the controller by solving the LMI feasibility problem. When an application environment is determined, we can get more targeted controllers. The outline of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we establish the dynamic model of the two-axis gimbaled platform and obtained its LPV form. In Section 3, a controller design method based on FTB theory is proposed, and the corresponding parameter setting principle is established. A series of simulations validate the effectiveness of the controller in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are highlighted in Section 5. 2 Dynamic model of a two-axis gimbal platform 2.1 Equation of motion of a two-axis gimbal platform A conventional configuration for the gimbal motion of a two-axis gimbaled platform is depicted as in Fig. 2 . Three coordinate frames are used to define the rotation about a dynamic platform, that is a body-fixed frame (B), a frame (A) fixed to the outer yaw (azimuth) gimbal and a frame (E) fixed to the inner pitch (elevation) gimbal. x a z y a z z a z and x e l y e l z e l represent the yaw and pitch gimbal frame axis, respectively. x b y b z b represent the body frame axis. LOS elevation control is exercised via the inner gimbal y-axis, while azimuth control is applied via the outer gimbal z-axis. The angular rate sensors are mounted on the LOS axes. The center of rotation is in the frame origin, which is assumed to be the same point for the three frames. ψ θ and ϕ are defined as the Euler angles which uses yaw-pitch-roll transformation order. ψ represents the relative azimuth angle between the outer and base coordinate frames. θ represents the relative elevation angle between the inner and outer coordinate frames. ϕ represents the relative angle between the inertial and base coordinate frames. The transformation matrixes can be expressed as below. (1) R z , ψ = cos ψ sin ψ 0 − sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 , R y , θ = cos θ 0 − sin θ 0 1 0 sin θ 0 cos θ , R x , ϕ = 1 0 0 0 cos ϕ sin ϕ 0 − sin ϕ cos ϕ We introduce (2) ω B = p q r , ω A = ω a x ω a y ω a z , ω E = ω e x ω e y ω e z as the angular velocity vectors of frames B, A and E, respectively. Therefore the angular velocities of the outer and inner gimbal are given by the Euler angular relationship. (3) ω A = R z , ψ ω B + 0 0 ψ ˙ T (4) ω E = R y , θ ω A + 0 θ ˙ 0 where ψ ˙ = ω a z − r and θ ˙ = ω e y − ω a y . The relationship between the angular acceleration of the inner and outer gimbal coordinate frames is obtained by differentiating (4). (5) ω ˙ E = R y , θ ω ˙ A + R ˙ y , θ ω A 0 θ ˙ 0 T + 0 θ ¨ 0 T where R ˙ y , θ = − sin θ 0 − cos θ 0 0 0 cos θ 0 − sin θ . Then ω ˙ A is given by (6) ω ˙ A = R y , θ T ω ˙ E − R y , θ T R ˙ y , θ ω A 0 θ ˙ 0 T − R y , θ T 0 θ ¨ 0 T Based on rigid body dynamics, the dynamic equation of motion for a two-axis gimbaled sensor system can be formulated as (7) J E ω ˙ E + ω E × J E ω E = T E where the sum of the kinematic torques about the elevation gimbal is (8) T E = T e x T e l M o t o r T e z − 0 T e f 0 T e x and T e z are reaction torques exerted by elevation on azimuth gimbal. T e l M o t o r is elevation stabilization control torque. T e f is friction torques. The friction torque consist of both linear and nonlinear parts, so it can be expressed as T e f = K e f θ ˙ + T e f r i c , where K e f is viscous friction coefficient, T e f r i c is nonlinear friction torques. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that the gimbal rotation axes are aligned with the principal axes of inertia so that the inertia sub-matrices of elevation are diagonal J E = d i a g J e x x J e y y J e z z . The elevation control axis is the inner gimbal y-axis, so the inner gimbal dynamics equation can be expanded as (9) J e y y ω ˙ e y = − ω e z ω e x J e x x − J e z z + T e l M o t o r − K e f θ ˙ − T e f r i c As the disturbance stems from base rates ω B and the controlled variables are ω e y and ω e z , so substituting (3) into (4) and then into (9). Then the elevation axis dynamics can be expressed as below (10) J e y y ω ˙ e y + K e f ω e y + ω e z ω a x − sin θ ω e z cos θ J e x x − J e z z = T e l M o t o r − T e f r i c + K e f q cos θ − p sin θ In a similar manner, the torque dynamics for the azimuth gimbal body are derived from (11) J A ω ˙ A + ω A × J A ω A + R y , θ T T E = T A where T A = T a x T a y T a z M o t o r − 0 0 T a f . T a x and T a y are azimuth gimbal reaction torques on base. T a z M o t o r is azimuth stabilization control torque. T a f is the friction torque between base and azimuth gimbal. As with the inner gimbal friction torque. T a f = K a f θ ˙ + T a f r i c , where K a f is viscous friction coefficient, T a f r i c is nonlinear friction torques. Assuming the outer inertia matrix is also diagonal, J A can be expressed as J A = d i a g J a x x J a y y J a z z . Substitute the T E as (7) into (11) and the ω ˙ A as (6) into (10) to obtain (12) J A R y , θ T + R y , θ T J E ω ˙ E + ω A × J A ω A + R y , θ T ω E × J E ω E − J A R y , θ T R ˙ y , θ ω A 0 θ ˙ 0 T − J A R y , θ T 0 θ ¨ 0 T = T A The azimuth axis dynamics are generated by the third element of vector (12). Expanding the equation for this component results in (13) J ¯ a z ω ˙ e z = sin θ J a z + J e x ω ˙ a x + J a z ω e z − sin θ J e x ω a z θ ˙ − cos θ ω a x ω a y J a y − J a x − sin θ ω e y ω e z J e z + ω e y ω a x J e y − cos θ ω e x ω e y J e x + cos θ T a z M o t o r − T a f − K a f θ ˙ where J ¯ a z = J a z + cos 2 θ J e z + sin 2 θ J e x As with the elevation axis, this equation needs to be expressed in terms of the controlled variables ω e z ω e y , the elevation and azimuth angles θ and ψ , and base disturbances. Based on (3) and (4), we can get (14) ω e x = 1 cos θ ω a x − sin θ ω e z (15) ω a z = 1 cos θ ω e z − sin θ ω a x Substitute (14) and (15) into (13), the modified expression is derived as (16) J ¯ a z ω ˙ e z = g z ω e z + g y ω a x ω e y + g y z ω e y ω e z + T o b a s e + c o s θ T a z M o t o r − T a f where T o b a s e is the disturbance from base motion.

Given a positive scalar T and a class of exogenous disturbance signals w defined as (35), the closed-loop system (36) x ˙ t = A p t x t + B p t u t + G p t w t is said to be finite-time bounded with respect to c 1 , c 2 , T , R , d ( c 1 < c 2 and R > 0 ),if (37) x T 0 R x 0 ≤ c 1 2 ⇒ x T t R x t ≤ c 2 2 , ∀ t ∈ 0 , T , ∀ w : ∫ 0 T w T t w t d t ≤ d 2 , d ≥ 0 Given system(36), there exists a state feedback in form of u t = K p t x t such that the system (38) x ˙ t = A p t + K p t x t + G p t w t is FTB if, fix a scalar α ≥ 0 and find two symmetric positive definite matrices Q 1 ∈ R n × n and Q 2 ∈ R l × l and matrices L j ∈ R m × n , j = 1 , ⋯ , N , and positive scalars λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 such that the following LMIs hold (39) λ 1 I < Q 1 < I (40) λ 2 I < Q 2 < λ 3 I (41) c 2 2 e − α T c 1 d c 1 λ 1 0 d 0 λ 2 > 0 (42) Θ i j + Θ j i < 0 , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N (43) Θ i i < 0 , i = 1 , ⋯ , N where (44) Θ i j = M G i Q 2 Q 2 G i T − Q 2 , 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N (45) M = A i R − 1 2 Q 1 R − 1 2 + B i L j + A i R − 1 2 Q 1 R − 1 2 + B i L j T − α R − 1 2 Q 1 R − 1 2 then the state feedback gain is given by (46) K p = ∑ j = 1 N p j t K j , ∑ j = 1 N p j t = 1 , p j t ≥ 0 , j = 1 , ⋯ , N with (47) K j = L j R − 1 2 Q 1 R − 1 2 − 1 Remark: In order to solve the controller design problem with the sufficient conditions above, we need to use the LMI toolbox to solve LMI feasibility problem, which is described by conditions (39)–(45), then evaluate the state feedback matrix K j . The detailed proof of the sufficient condition is shown in reference [23]. However, we solve LMI feasibility problem to get a controller, instead of minimize linear objective under LMI constraints in [23]. The principle of parameter setting should be determined before designing the controller. Design specifications of the controller depends on the stability requirement, the intensity of the movement of the base and the sensor specifications. When the lead-proportional-integral controller is adopted in the single-channel decoupling model, P. Garnell [24] illustrated how to determine the design specifications and how to compromise in a given condition. However, with the controller design method presented in this paper, the controller parameters depend on c 1 , c 2 , T , d . The desired finite time T , scalar α and the ratio of c 1 and d is determined by the typical working mode. The value of c 2 will have an effect on the specifications of the two-axis gimbal platform, such as bandwidth and settling time. A smaller c 2 will result in a bigger gain and a higher bandwidth. When an application environment is determined ( c 1 , α , T , d is determined), the design process can be simplified as adjusting c 2 . The controller is designed with the following gimbal parameters, which were listed in Table 1 . Considering a typical application environment, c 1 , c 2 , and d is set as c 1 = 1 , c 2 = 165 , T = 13 and d = 1 . At the same time, limited working time is set to 13 s. The LMI feasibility problem yields the state feedback matrix with (48) K 1 = − 0.0396 − 68.3903 − 0.001 0.0290 − 0.003 0.0118 − 0.0967 − 132.5956 K 2 = − 0.0396 − 68.3903 0.001 − 0.0290 0.003 − 0.0118 − 0.0967 − 132.5956 K 3 = − 0.0396 − 28.8318 − 0.001 0.0290 − 0.003 0.0118 − 0.0967 − 35.2223 K 4 = − 0.0396 − 28.8318 0.001 − 0.0290 0.003 − 0.0118 − 0.0967 − 35.2223 The state feedback gain is given by(46), with (49) p 1 = 0.5 − ω a x + 0.5 − ω a y 4 (50) p 2 = 0.5 − ω a x + 0.5 + ω a y 4 (51) p 3 = 0.5 + ω a x + 0.5 − ω a y 4 (52) p 4 = 0.5 + ω a x + 0.5 + ω a y 4 According to (3), we can get ω a x and ω a y by the angular velocity of the base, which is measured by the gyroscopic mounted on the base. (53) ω a x = p cos ψ + q sin ψ (54) ω a y = − p sin ψ + q cos ψ 4 Simulation and results The two-axis gimbal platform was simulated in order to provide a comparison of the controller designed in this paper and a PI compensator. Two rate gyros are chosen to provide angular velocity information of the gimbal in the control process, whose constant drift is 15°/h. A PI compensator was given by (55) G c s = 18 s + 25 s In order to test the designed FTB controller performance in a limited time, especially the pitch and yaw channel coupling interference suppression performance, a simulation experiment is designed. The sinusoidal disturbance rates are p = q = r = 3 sin ( 6 π ) . The simulation represents a typical disturbance environment with aircraft. System input angular velocity is section of trapezoidal wave, the maximum angular velocity is 6°/s. Angular velocity input and the corresponding framework angle input is shown in Fig. 3 . When the pitch channel tracking the input signals, pitch output error and yaw coupling error are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b).Even if the input is a single frequency sine signals, yaw channel also can produce error due to the coupling. It can be seen from the diagram that, the max tracking error of pitch channel were 0.2°/s with both PI and FTB controller. The max coupling error of yaw channel with PI controller is 0.8°/s, however, the max coupling error of yaw channel with FTB controller is down to 0.2°/s. When the yaw channel tracking the input signals, pitch coupling error and yaw output error are shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b). It can be seen that the max tracking error in yaw channel with PI controller is 0.3°/s and that with FTB controller is down to 0.14°/s. As for the max coupling error, FTB controller reduced that from 0.14°/s to 0.06°/s. In order to support the performance analysis, a quantitative study of error analysis has been achieved utilizing two frequently used error integral criteria; integral square error(ISE) and integral absolute error(IAE): (56) I S E = ∫ 0 T e t 2 d t I A E = ∫ 0 T e t d t where e t is the measured error, and T = 13 . The values of error integral criteria obtained for elevation and azimuth channels are provided in Table 2 , which indicates that the error in FTB controller is minimum as compared to PI controller which shows the superiority of the proposed FTB controller. To quantitative coupling error between pitch and yaw channel, we statistic the coupling output in 13 s. That is to say, we cumulative the pitch angular velocity coupling when yaw channel tracking orders and the yaw angular velocity coupling when pitch channel tracking orders. We also use the ISE and IAE to measure coupling. The quantitative results are provided in Table 3 . It can be seen from the table that, compared to PI controller, FTB controller have a stronger coupling inhibition ability. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we developed the dynamic model of a pitch-yaw gimbal platform and presented its LPV form. A FTB controller is proposed to improve the performance under disturbance in finite time. A simulation test was designed to compare the controller presented in the paper and the PI controller. The results show that the FTB controller has a stronger disturbance rejection and coupling inhibition capability. The design and analysis method can be applied in the controller design of seeker or some other pitch-yaw gimbaled sensor system.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.138,Investigation of optical bandgap variation and photoluminescence behavior in nanocrystalline CuO thin films,"Abstract Since the absorption spectrum of CuO is well matched with the spectrum of the sunlight, it is considered to have potential applications in some optoelectronic devices such as solar cells etc. In order to obtain better performance of CuO-based devices, it is necessary to deeply understand the effect of structural parameters of thin films such as thickness on the physical properties of CuO thin films. In this study, the CuO thin films with different thicknesses were prepared by a facile sol-gel method. The structural, morphological, compositional and optical properties of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence, respectively. The results show that all samples have a cubic structure regardless of film thickness. However, the photoluminescence behavior that strongly depends on the film thickness is found. When the film thickness is thin, CuO films show a strong violet, green and red co-emission. However, as the thickness increases, the fluorescence of the CuO films is rapidly quenched. It is proposed that the photoluminescence behavior of CuO thin films is closely related to the change of optical bandgap caused by the variation of crystallite size and we gave a tentative explanation for the luminescence changes.",Apr-18," Keywords CuO thin films Sol-gel method Film thickness Optical bandgap Photoluminescence behavior 1 Introduction Wide bandgap metal-oxide semiconductors such as ZnO, TiO2, SnO2 and so on have been extensively and deeply studied due to a wide range of applications including optoelectronic devices [1–10]. In recent years, the medium bandgap CuO materials have also attracted wide attention because they have potential applications in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors. However, compared with the above-mentioned several wide bandgap metal-oxide semiconductors, the studies on CuO are still far few. CuO is a thermally and chemically stable medium bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap energy in the range of 1.2–2.6 eV varying with the preparation conditions [11–13] and is usually shown as p-type conductivity due to the presence of copper vacancy defects [14]. So far, CuO thin films have been prepared by many methods, such as electrodeposition [13], chemical vapor deposition [15], magnetron sputtering [16], pulsed laser deposition [17], successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction [18], sol-gel method [12,19] and so on. Among these thin film deposition techniques, sol-gel method is a wet chemical method, which has been widely used in many fields due to some advantages like low cost, simple equipment, no need of vacuum environment, high film-forming efficiency and easy realization of molecular level doping. It is well known that the photoelectric properties of thin films depend on the preparation techniques, the deposition conditions and the structural parameters of the film itself. So far, there have some reports on the influence of the preparation techniques and deposition conditions on the CuO thin films [11–15], but the effects of the film structure parameters such as film thickness on the optical properties of CuO thin films are reported to be very few [18,20], especially for the CuO thin film with a thickness in the range of 0–200 nm. For example, Akaltun et al. [18] deposited the CuO thin films with thickness in the range of 125–310 nm on the glass substrates by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction and studied the effect of film thickness on the structure, optical bandgap and refractive index of the samples. Shrividhya et al. [20] prepared CuO films on glass substrates by double dip technique; the effect of the growth solution concentration on the CuO films was studied. The thickness of the deposited CuO films was in the range of 1.3–2.1 μm. Al-Ghamdi et al. [21] studied the effect of growth time on the structure and optical properties of CuO thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering on glass substrates. They found that as the growth time increased, the film thickness rose from 160 to 490 nm. The change of the film thickness also led to the obvious variation of bandgap and luminescence behavior of CuO thin films. In addition, Ravichandran et al. [22] synthesized CuO thin films on glass substrates using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction, and investigated the effect of immersion time on the physical properties of CuO thin films. Because the different immersion time led to different film thicknesses, they were equivalent to indirectly investigating the effect of film thickness on the physical properties of CuO films. As an important parameter affecting the physical properties of CuO thin films, it is very important to understand the effect of film thickness on the properties of CuO films. As far as we know, the effect of the thickness of the CuO thin film prepared by the sol-gel method on its optical properties is reported to be very few. In view of this, we prepared CuO thin films with different thicknesses using sol-gel method in this study, and investigated the effect of thickness on the optical properties of CuO thin films. The experimental results showed that the optical bandgap and luminescence behavior of CuO thin films exhibited a strong dependence on the thickness of the films. The detailed results are described below. 2 Experiments The CuO thin films were prepared on glass substrates by sol-gel method. The specific preparation procedure is described below. First, a CuO sol is prepared by using monohydrate copper acetate, anhydrous ethanol and monoethanolamine as solute, solvent and stabilizer, respectively. The concentration of copper acetate in the sol is 0.2 mol/L; the molar ratio of copper acetate to monoethanolamine is 1:1. The sealed CuO sol is allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 h, and then the CuO sol is coated on the substrates by spin-coating. The spin-speed of the substrate is 2800 rpm, and the spin-coating time is 40 s. After the completion of one coating, the sample is put into a furnace at 280 °C for 3 min to remove the solvent and the organic residue, and then the next coating is carried out. In order to obtain CuO thin films with different thicknesses, the spin-coating process is repeated 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 times, respectively, and the corresponding CuO thin films are named Sample A, B, C, D and E. Finally, the CuO thin films were annealed at 450 °C for 60 min in air atmosphere. The surface and cross-section morphologies of the samples were analyzed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (S4800). The crystalline phase of the samples was determined by an X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab). The surface composition and the chemical bonding states of the constituent elements of the films were analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo escalab 250Xi). The optical absorbance and reflectivity of the samples were measured by a double beam spectrophotometer (Cary5000). The photoluminescence behavior was analyzed by a spectrometer (LabRAM HR800) using a He-Cd laser as the excitation source with a wavelength of 325 nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The morphology, crystalline phase and chemical composition of the films Fig.1 displays the surface and cross-section morphology images of the samples. As for the sample which is coated only one time, it can be seen from Fig. 1(b) that the film thickness is about 20 nm. The surface of the film shows a lot of nanocrystals, indicating a polycrystalline nature of the sample. These nanocrystals are not tightly packed together, but basically stand alone. The appearance of this result is due to the growth mode of the film. That is to say, the “island-growth-mode” dominates the growth of CuO thin films at this stage. However, with the increase in the number of coated layer, not only the thickness of CuO thin film increases, and the film density is also significantly improved. The grains are gradually growing up. For sample A, B, C, D and E, their in-plane average grain sizes are 4.1, 10.3, 13.4, 37.1 and 39.2 nm, respectively. It can be seen from the variation of the grain size that when the number of coated layer exceeds 4, the growth rate of the grains in the CuO films appears to be faster, but when the number of coated layer is higher than 6, the growth rate of the grains decreases again. Fig.2 shows the XRD patterns of CuO thin films with different thicknesses. When the film is relatively thin, its diffraction peak is very weak, indicating that the crystallites are very small and the crystallinity of the film is poor. As the film thickness increases, two distinct diffraction peaks (002) and (111) are clearly observed. A (−202) diffraction peak is also observed when the number of coated layer exceeds 4. All of these diffraction peaks correspond to the diffraction peaks of CuO in a monoclinic phase (JCPDS card No. 45-0937), and no diffraction peaks associated with cuprous oxide or cuprous hydroxide are observed, indicating that the deposited CuO films have a pure monoclinic phase regardless of film thickness. With the increase of the thickness, the intensity of the diffraction peaks is gradually enhanced, suggesting that the crystallinity of CuO thin films is gradually improved. The average crystallite size of the CuO thin films was calculated using the data from the (002) peaks by the following formula: (1) d = 0.9 λ β cos θ where d is the average crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, β is the angular line width at the half-maximum intensity in radians, and θ is the diffraction angle. For sample B, C, D and E, their crystallite sizes are 8.1, 13.3, 20.5 and 22.1 nm, respectively. Since the diffraction peak of sample A is very weak, accurate data cannot be extracted to calculate its crystallite size. However, it can be qualitatively known from the results given by the SEM images that the crystallite size of sample A should be less than 4 nm. We can see that the trend in the change of the crystallite size calculated from the Sherrer’s formula is consistent with the results observed from the SEM images, i.e., as the film thickness increases, the crystals gradually grow up. When the number of the coating is less than 6 layers, the crystal sizes obtained from SEM and XRD is almost same. However, when the film is thicker, the crystal sizes observed from SEM are significantly larger than those calculated from the XRD data. It is generally accepted that the grains observed by the SEM are actually formed by the aggregation of some small crystallites [23,24] and are therefore larger than the crystallites obtained from the XRD data. However, some researchers have reported that the grain size observed by SEM is substantially same as the crystallite size calculated by XRD data [25]. The difference may be related to thin film growth mode caused by different deposition techniques. Here it can be seen from Fig. 1(a) that when the film is very thin, most of the CuO grains are basically not combined together, but exist independently. In this situation, a grain maybe is composed of one crystallite. Therefore, the crystal size calculated from XRD data is almost same as that observed from the SEM image. However, when the film is relatively thick, the adjacent small crystallites gradually merge and grow up during the annealing process, resulting in the crystal size calculated from the XRD data is not consistent with that observed from the SEM image. In order to analyze the surface composition and the chemical state of the constituent elements, the XPS spectra have been taken for sample B, as shown in Fig.3 . The binding energy in the XPS spectra has been calibrated by using that of C 1s (284. 8 eV). It can be seen from the survey spectrum of Fig. 3(a) that only the signals of Cu and O are shown in this spectrum, which means that the sample is composed only of Cu and O and does not contain other impurities. Fig.3(b) illustrates the high-resolution spectrum of Cu 2p. The two signal peaks at 933.7 and 953.7 eV are from Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, along with two satellite peaks at 942.5 and 962.4 eV. The above information indicates that Cu ions are in +2 valence state in the films [14,20]. Therefore, the samples are pure CuO thin films, which is consistent with the results of XRD. Fig.3 (c) gives the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s. A signal peak at 530.0 eV is observed, and it is clear that the peak is geometrically symmetric; this signal is thought to result from the lattice oxygen bound to Cu2+ [14,20]. 3.2 The optical properties of CuO thin films Fig.4 (a) shows the optical absorption spectra of the samples. All samples show strong absorption in the visible and near infrared regions. With the increase of the film thickness, the absorbance of the CuO thin films gradually increases, and similar results were reported in other studies [21]. The optical bandgaps of the CuO thin films can be obtained by using Tauc's relation [24] to make plots of (αhν)2 vs. hv, and extrapolate their linear parts to the energy axis, as shown in Fig. 4(b). For sample A, B, C, D and E, their direct bandgap are 2.51, 2.40, 2.10, 1.65 and 1.56 eV, respectively. These values are close to those of the CuO films prepared by the sol-gel method reported by Baturay et al. and Akgul et al. [12,24]. As the thickness of the film increases, the optical bandgap decreases gradually, and similar results have been also reported by other researchers [18,21], which is mainly attributed to the grown-up of CuO grains and the improvement of crystal quality [24]. The larger bandgap is expected when the CuO crystallite is smaller according to the following formula given by Marotti et al. [26]: (2) E ( R ) = E g ( ∞ ) + E b π a B R 2 where R is the radius of the crystallite, E ( R ) is the lowest transition energy, E g ( ∞ ) is the “bulk” band gap energy, E b is the exciton binding energy and a B is the exciton Bohr radius. For the bandgaps of CuO films, the results reported show a large difference. For example, Jundale et al. [11] deposited CuO thin films by sol-gel method. They found that as the annealing temperature increased from 300 to 700 °C, the bandgap of the CuO films was reduced from 1.64 to 1.46 eV. Kawwam et al. [14] used pulsed laser deposition to grow a highly (111) oriented CuO thin film on MgO (100) substrates with a band gap of 1.32 eV; Chen et al. [17] also prepared CuO thin film by pulsed laser deposition and found that the direct bandgap of the film was 2.12 eV. For another sample, Wang et al. [13] fabricated nano-structured CuO films by electrodeposition on glass substrates to find their bandgap up to 3.3 eV. From these results it can be seen that even if the CuO films deposited by the same method [14,17], their bandgaps may also be very different. This indicates that the bandgaps of CuO films are closely related to the deposition method and deposition parameters. The bandgap of CuO thin film has a wide range of adjustment, which is different from most other metal-oxide semiconductors. For example, the bandgap of ZnO thin films can be only changed greatly in the case of doping. Such a feature of the CuO bandgap is an important advantage for its application in some optoelectronic devices. As we all know, photoluminescence is a non-destructive, highly sensitive analytical method that can study the electronic structure and defects of materials. Therefore, more information can be gotten from the photoluminescence study of CuO films, but the reported results on photoluminescence of the CuO thin films are few to date. Even if there have some reports on photoluminescence of CuO thin films, most did not give a reasonable explanation about the luminescence behavior due to the complex band structure of CuO. Here, some strange phenomena of emissions in CuO thin films are also observed. Fig. 5 (a) shows the photoluminescence spectra of CuO thin films with different thicknesses. Sample A shows a strong luminescence, while the luminescence intensity of sample B is weakened compared with sample A. As the thickness further increases, the luminescence of the CuO film is almost completely quenched. For direct bandgap metal-oxide semiconductor materials, in general, there are two main types of emissions. One is caused by the electron transition from the conduction band bottom to the valence band top (near band edge emission, NBE emission), belonging to the intrinsic emission (for example, the UV emission of ZnO in the range of 370–390 nm belongs to this type of emission [3,7]); and the other is caused by the transitions between the defective energy levels or between the defect levels and the conduction band/valence band, which is called defect-related emission. In general, the photon energy of the NBE emission is close to or less than the bandgap energy, and the photon energy of defect-related emissions is far less than the bandgap energy. In order to clarify the emission wavelength (photon energy) of the CuO thin films, we have performed a Gaussian fitting for the emission spectrum of sample A, as shown in Fig. 5(b). This wide luminous band is actually superimposed by three emission peaks: the violet emission peak located at 429 nm (2.89 eV), the green emission peak located at 519 nm (2.39 eV), and the red emission peak located at 681 nm (1.82 eV). For sample A, its bandgap is 2.51 eV, so the green and red emissions here may be caused by the electron transitions between the defect levels in the forbidden band or between the defect levels and the conduction band/valence band, but the origin of the violet emission seem not to be attributed to the direct transition of the electrons between the conduction band bottom and the valence band top since the photon energy of the violet emission is significantly higher than the value of the bandgap. The similar phenomena have also occurred in other studies. For example, Al-Ghamdi et al. [21] prepared three CuO thin films by magnetron sputtering, all of which showed a UV emission of 387 nm (3.20 eV), whereas the bandgap of the three films was 1.73, 1.88 and 2.2 eV, respectively. They did not specify the origin of the UV emission. Chand et al. [27] deposited Li-doped CuO thin films by pulsed laser deposition. Those CuO thin films exhibited similar emission spectra shape at 325 nm UV excitation. They all included three luminescent centers, namely, ultraviolet emissions at 359 and 383 nm and blue emission at 441 nm. The bandgap of the Li-doped CuO thin films was reduced from 2.99 to 2.76 eV with increasing Li doping concentration. Chand et al. deemed that the UV emissions centered at 359 and 383 nm were the band edge emissions of CuO, while the blue emission centered at 441 nm was related to defects such as oxygen vacancies etc. Although this special luminescence behavior is rarely reported in other metal-oxide semiconductors, it has been found several times in CuO nanomaterials, indicating that the band structure of CuO has some particularity. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5(a) that the luminescence intensity of the CuO thin film decreases rapidly with increasing thickness, and a similar phenomenon occurred in the study of Al-Ghamdi et al. [21]. The phenomenon is very different from that in other metal-oxide semiconductor thin films. For example, in the ZnO thin films, the crystal quality is usually improved with the increase of the film thickness, and therefore its intrinsic luminescence tends to increase [28]. Furthermore, the emission attenuation of the CuO thin film seems to be related to the decrease of the bandgap, since that the luminescence intensity decreases with the reduction of the bandgap of CuO films has been observed in several studies [21,27,29], and all the emissions regardless of wavelength are weakened. However, because the band structure calculations of CuO nanostructures are limited even in its bulk form due to large variations in the electron and hole effective mass, prediction and photoluminescence band assignments are complex [29]. It is known that whether the crystallite size of the CuO thin films calculated using the XRD data or the optical bandgap of the thin films derived from the absorption spectra is an integral parameter or an average value that is used to describe the overall properties of the film. However, the actual situation is that there may be many nanocrystals less than the average crystallite size in the CuO thin films, especially in the thinner CuO films. From the above formula (2), it can be known that the actual bandgap is much larger than that of the films for these small nanocrystals [30]. In this case, it is entirely possible that ultraviolet emission or violet emission is produced by electron transitions from the conduction band bottom to the valence band top. Since the quantum dots/nanodots often contain many point defects, the defect-level related transitions may cause blue, green, red and other visible emissions. Then, why will the emissions be significantly reduced or even completely quenched when the bandgap of the CuO thin film decreases? One possibility is that the bandgap type of CuO has been changed from direct bandgap to indirect bandgap (some researchers also tend to think that CuO has an indirect bandgap [14,20,31]), which maybe lead the electronic direct transition efficiency to be greatly reduced or makes the excited electrons release energy in a non-radiative manner. However, it should be noted that this is only a speculation. In order to completely reveal the true origin of emissions above the bandgap energy in CuO, a large number of theoretical calculations and experimental studies are needed. In addition, it is necessary to calculate the energy levels for the common point defects such as oxygen vacancy, copper vacancy, etc. in CuO forbidden band, which makes it possible to determine the origin of visible emissions. Fig. 6 shows the reflection spectra of the CuO thin films with different thicknesses. These CuO films show a relatively high reflectivity, especially for the two samples A and B which has a thinner thickness. It can be seen that the reflectivity of the CuO thin film with the same thickness changes little in the visible region while the reflectivity in the infrared region changes greatly. As the thickness increases, the reflectivity of the CuO thin film is gradually reduced, except that of sample B which is slightly increased. Chen et al. [17] prepared a CuO thin film with a thickness of 140 nm using pulsed laser deposition. The reflection spectrum showed that the average reflectivity of the sample in the visible region was about 15%. Shrividhya et al. [20] prepared CuO films with thicknesses more than 1 μm by two double dip method, whose reflectivity exceeded 80% in the visible region. Akgul et al. [24] deposited CuO thin films with a thickness of 520 nm by spin coating, which exhibited a reflectivity of about 10% in the visible region. These results show that the appropriate thickness can reduce the reflectivity of the CuO films. When the CuO film is used in solar cells, its reflectivity is an important parameter, so it is necessary to optimize the thickness to reduce the reflectivity and improve the absorption efficiency as much as possible. 4 Conclusion In this study, we investigated the effect of thickness on the optical properties of CuO thin films. When the CuO film is very thin, it shows a strong photoluminescence. The fitted emission spectrum shows three emission peaks, namely, violet, green and red emission peaks. The violet emission may be due to the transition between the conduction band bottom and the valence band top in those nanocrystals with larger bandgap energy than that of the films, while the green and red emissions may be related to the transition between the defect levels or between the defect levels and conduction band/valence band. It is found that the optical bandgap and photoluminescence intensity of CuO thin films decreased gradually with the increase of film thickness. The bandgap reduction of CuO thin films is mainly due to the grown-up of CuO grains and the improvement of crystal quality. The luminescence decay of the CuO thin film may be associated with its reduced bandgap. However, due to the lack of support from the theoretical results of CuO, here we give some tentative suggestions for the luminescence behavior of CuO thin films. In order to realize the application of CuO films in optoelectronic devices as early as possible, it is necessary to carry out more and deeper research on CuO materials.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.183,Exponential density transition based self-focusing of Gaussian laser beam in collisional plasma,"Abstract In this work, nonlinear aspects of a high intensity Gaussian laser beam propagating in plasma having upward density ramp of tangent and exponential profiles are studied. We have employed the nonlinearity in dielectric function of plasma due to nonuniform heating of carriers along the wavefront of the laser beam which is important in collisional plasmas. The differential equation governing the dimensionless beam width parameter is achieved by using Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) and paraxial approximations and solved it numerically by using Runge-Kutta fourth order method. Effect of exponential density ramp profile on self-focusing is systematically carried out and compared with tangent density ramp profile. It is found that exponential plasma density ramp causes the laser beam to become more focused than tangent density ramp over several Rayleigh length and gives reasonably interesting results.",Apr-18," Keywords Self-focusing Gaussian laser beam Density ramp Collisional plasma 1 Introduction Advances in the laser technology opened the way to experiments involving laser pulses focused to extremely high intensities. High energy laser beam and plasma interaction give variety of phenomena which are important in many applications, such as generation of new radiation sources [1], high harmonic generation [2], laser-driven inertial confinemet fusion [3], laser-based plasma accelerators [4], self-phase modulation [5], soft X-ray generation [6], etc. Self-focusing describes in general focusing of the laser beam by itself as a result of the nonlinear refractive index induced by the beam itself. It describes the trapping of light in a plasma channel created by the instantaneous response of the nonlinear refractive index to the light beam [7]. Self-focusing is often responsible for the optical damage created in a solid by a high-power laser beam [8]. When a laser beam, having non-uniform intensity distribution along its wavefront, propagating through the plasma, electrons get heated and temperature gradient occurs. Temperature gradient results out electron diffusion and generation of space charge field. The collisional non-linearity occurs because of electrons acquiring temperature higher than other species, i.e. ions on account of net effect of ohmic heating and energy lost by electrons due to collisions with heavy particles (atoms/molecules and ions) and by thermal conduction. This analysis accounted only one type of energy loss viz. collisional or thermal conduction. Thus the effective dielectric function get modified significantly, this self-induced inhomogeneity in the dielectric constant of the plasma gives rise to self-focusing and defocusing effect of the beam [9]. In recent years, a considerable interest has been evinced for slowly increasing plasma density ramp to overcome the diffraction and guiding the laser beam over long distance. There are lot of work had been carried with different density ramp profiles [10–20], in which tangent density ramp profile has been studied extensively due to its upward increasing nature but profile such as n = n 0 + n 0 tan(ξ/d) shoot to infinity at particular value of ξ = ξ d , which signifies that medium will have infinite density at ξ d , so that study of self-focusing by using such profiles are limited to the value of ξ < ξ d . This limit is systematically overcame by replacing new exponential density ramp profile of n = n 0 exp(ξ/d), such type of ramp profile has been suggested by Sen et al. [21] but not explored extensively. The aim of this paper for the first time is to investigate the effect of exponential density ramp on self-focusing of Gaussian laser beam in collisional plasma. As usual, present analysis employs parabolic wave equation approach under WKB and paraxial approximations. We have shown noteworthy comparison of n = n 0 exp(ξ/d) with n = n 0 + n 0 tan(ξ/d), as both profiles shows n = n 0 at ξ = 0. The systematic organization of this paper is as fallows: Section 1 describes the evolution of beam width parameter of Gaussian laser beam propagating through collisional plasma with upward density ramp profiles. In Section 2, detailed discussion of the results has been presented. Finally a brief conclusion is added in Section 3. Here we are considering propagation of laser beam into the plasma along z direction, starting from z = 0: (1) E = A ( r , z ) exp [ i ( ω t − k 0 z ) ] , where k 0 = ω c ε 0 is wave number in the absence of plasma density transition and ω is frequency of laser used. The wave equation governing the electric field vector of a laser beam in plasma medium with effective dielectric function ε can be written as (2) ∇ 2 E → + ω 2 c 2 ε E → = 0 . In cylindrical coordinate system, Eq. (2) can be written as (3) ∂ 2 E → ∂ z 2 + ∂ 2 E → ∂ r 2 + 1 r ∂ E → ∂ r + ω 2 c 2 ε E → = 0 . The effective dielectric function of plasma can also be written as [9] (4) ε = ε 0 + ϕ ( EE * ) , where ε 0 = 1 − ( ω p 2 / ω 2 ) is the linear part of dielectric constant with ω p = ( 4 π ne 2 / m ) 1 / 2 as the plasma frequency. Here e and m are the electronic charge and its rest mass respectively. The perturbed electron density n is given by (5) n = n 0 exp z dR d and (6) n = n 0 + n 0 tan z dR d , where n 0 is the equilibrium electron density, R d = kr o 2 is diffraction length with k = ω c ε is the wave number in presence of plasma density transition and d is adjustable dimensionless parameter. Second term in Eq. (4), the intensity dependent part of dielectric constant for collisional plasma is given by, (7) ϕ ( EE * ) = ω p 2 ω 2 α EE * 2 + α EE * , with α = e 2 M 6 k B T 0 ω 2 m 2 where M, k 0 and T 0 are mass of ion, Boltzmann constant and equilibrium temperature of plasma respectively. We now introduce eikonal S as, (8) A = A 0 ( r , z ) exp [ ikS ( r , z ) ] , where A 0(r, z) and S(r, z) are real function of r and z with, (9) S = r 2 2 β ( z ) + ϕ ( z ) , where β(z) can be expressed as (1/f)(∂f/∂z) and it represent the reciprocal of curvature of the wave front and ϕ(z) is phase shift. For incident Gaussian laser beam we write, (10) A 0 2 = E 0 2 f 2 exp − r 2 r 0 2 f 2 , where f is beam width parameter which is measure of both axial intensity and width of the beam and r 0 is initial radius of laser beam. Following the approach given by Akhomonov et al. [22] and devoloped by Sodha et al. [23], we have obtained nonlinear differential equation in presence of exponential density ramp profile as, (11) 1 − ξ ω p 0 2 exp ξ / d 2 d ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) exp ξ / d d 2 f d ξ 2 = 1 f 3 − 2 exp ξ / d α E 0 2 ω p 0 2 fr 0 2 ( α E 0 2 + 2 f 2 ) 2 c 2 − ξ ω p 0 2 exp ξ / d 2 d ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) exp ξ / d df d ξ 2 + ω p 0 2 exp ξ / d 2 d ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) exp ξ / d 1 − ξ ω p 0 2 exp ξ / d 2 d ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) exp ξ / d df d ξ . Similarly we have obtained nonlinear differential equation in presence of density ramp of tangent profile as (12) 1 − ξ ω p 0 2 sec 2 ξ / d 2 d ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) 1 + tan ξ / d d 2 f d ξ 2 = 1 f 3 − 2 1 + tan ξ / d α E 0 2 ω p 0 2 fr 0 2 ( α E 0 2 + 2 f 2 ) 2 c 2 − ξ ω p 0 2 sec 2 ξ / d 2 df ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) 1 + tan ξ / d df d ξ 2 + ω p 0 2 sec 2 ξ / d 2 d ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) 1 + tan ξ / d 1 − ξ ω p 0 2 sec 2 ξ / d 2 d ω 2 1 − ( ω p 0 2 / ω 2 ) 1 + tan ξ / d df d ξ . 2 Results and discussion Eqs. (11) and (12) represents variation of beam width parameter f with normalized distance of propagation ξ for exponential and tangent density ramp profiles respectively. These are the second order nonlinear differential equations and can be numerically solved by choosing following laser-plasma parameters: r 0 = 20 × 10−4 cm, ω = 1.7760 × 1015 rad/s, n 0 = 3.9645 × 1017 cm−3. α E 0 2 = 5 , d = 20 . The first term on the right-hand side of Eqs. (11) and (12) corresponds to the diffraction divergence of the beam and the second term corresponds to the convergence resulting from the nonlinearity and remaining terms appears due to plasma density ramp. It is important to note that in absence of density transition, Eqs. (11) and (12) reduces to (13) d 2 f d ξ 2 = 1 f 3 − 2 α E 0 2 ω p 0 2 fr 0 2 ( α E 0 2 + 2 f 2 ) 2 c 2 . Eq. (13) is identical to a similar equation obtained earlier by Sodha et al. [23] for collisional plasma of uniform density. In Fig. 1 , both tangent and exponential density ramp profiles are plotted for d = 10 and n 0 = 3.9645 × 1017 cm−3. From this figure it is clear that tangent function increases rapidly with increase in value of ξ and diverges to infinity at particular value of ξ = ξ d . In this case ξ d  = 15.8. On other hand, exponential profile shows smooth variation of density with respect to normalized distance of propagation ξ. Fig. 2 a shows variation of beam width parameter f with normalized propagation distance ξ. This gives comparison of f with ξ for exponential density ramp plasma, tangent density ramp plasma and plasma having no ramp. Oscillatory self-focusing is observed when density of plasma is uniform. In presence of density ramp, oscillatory self-focusing with decrease of spot size with ξ is observed. Fig. 2a shows that there is initial agreement of f values for both profiles. It is to be noted that enhanced self-focusing is observed for exponential ramp profile than tangent profile. Fig. 2b explain reason of such behavior. In this figure the intensity dependent dielectric constant ϕ is plotted as function of normalized propagation distance ξ. In presence of ramp, the value of ϕ increases rapidly as compared to value of ϕ in absence of ramp. Since the strength of self-focusing depends upon the value of ϕ, laser spot size decreases rapidly and become more focused as laser beam goes more deeper into the plasma. From Fig. 2, it is clear that, minimum value of f matches with the peak value of ϕ and vice versa, along the beam axis. It is to be noted that divergence of tangent profile at particular value of ξ put limitation on the study of self-focusing. Such limitation is overcame by introducing exponential ramp profile. Thus for large value of normalized propagation distance ξ, the exponential ramp profile is more preferable than tangent ramp profile. Such exponential upward density ramp profile slowly increases the self-focusing by slowly increasing the density. As the laser propagates through the exponential density ramp region, it sees a slowly narrowing channel. In this plasma environment, the oscillation amplitude of the laser spot size reduces significantly, while its frequency increases. Thus exponential plasma density ramp causes the laser beam to become more focused over several Rayleigh length. Normalized intensity I/I 0 versus beam normalized beam width r/r 0 and normalized propagation distance ξ in plasma are plotted in Fig. 3 . It shows that by propagating the laser beam through the plasma its intensity is increased which shows self-focusing. To support this result the density plot for spot size profile is shown in Fig. 4 . It is observed from this figure that with increase in distance of propagation ξ spot size decreases which leads to increase in laser intensity. Moreover, the peaks of beam intensity correspond to valleys of f parameter. 3 Conclusion In conclusion, we comparatively studied the effect of tangent and exponential density ramp profiles on self-focusing of Gaussian laser beam in collisional plasma by using usual parabolic equation approach. Following important conclusions are drawn from present analysis: • As obvious, exponential and tangent density profiles causes the laser beam to become more focused in collisional plasma. • Enhanced self-focusing is observed for exponential density ramp profile than tangent density ramp profile. • For the propagation of laser beam over several Rayleigh length, exponential ramp profile is more preferable than tangent ramp profile. The present results are of relevance in various laser plasma-applications, where propagation of laser beam with localized energy over several Rayleigh length are required. "," [1] D.A. Jaroszynski G.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.12.055,Designing a 2-to-4 decoder on nanoscale based on quantum-dot cellular automata for energy dissipation improving,"Abstract Quantum dot Cellular Automata (QCA) as a new architecture at the nanoscale is developed as a feasible alternative for the existing Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor (CMOS) designs. The decoder in the QCA is a very important circuit to address the QCA-based random access memory arrays. It plays a key role in many circuit designs, such as Controlled Logic Block (CLB), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and memory circuits’ designs. In this paper, a five-input majority gate is used in a modular design methodology to design a 2-to-4 decoder in QCA. The proposed 2-to-4 QCA-based decoder can be utilized to synthesize n-to-2n decoders as well. The functional correctness of the proposed circuit is evaluated using QCADesigner tool. Also, QCAPro simulator as a popular power estimator tool in QCA evaluates the power dissipation. The obtained results have shown the significant success in terms of clock speed (%57), wire-crossing (%33), cell number (%27), area (%26) and power dissipation than the existing designs.",Apr-18," Keywords Quantum dot cellular automata Power consumption Decoder Nanoscale QCA 1 Introduction Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) was proposed by Lent in 1993 [1]. Low power, high density, and regularity are considered for its performance. Also, it presents a new device architecture for nanotechnology [2,3]. Cells are made up of four quantum dots along corners of a square with two electrons. The two possible arrangements signify logic 0 or logic 1 [4,5]. The Columbic interactions with neighboring cell states define the position of the cell [5,6]. Circuits occupy smaller area using QCA technology compared to Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS). Thus, they stand as a good substitute to the CMOS technology [7]. The power consumption is significantly less than conventional CMOS circuits because of electrical current absence in QCA computations. The power consumption issue of the circuits has been ignored in many QCA logical and arithmetic designs [8]. On the other hands, the decoder is a circuit that modifies a code into a set of signals. The line decoder is considered as a type of decoder, which receipts an n-digit binary number and decodes it into 2n data lines. The 1-to-2 decoder is considered as the simplest. There is a procedure to design larger line decoders. Smaller decoders just like other digital circuits should combine together for making larger decoders. An alternative circuit for the 2-to-4 line decoder which is changing the 1-to-2 decoders with their circuits will show that both circuits are alike. In a similar fashion, a 3-to-8 decoder can be designed based on 1-to-2 and 2-to-4 decoders, and a 4-to-16 decoder can be designed based on two 2-to-4 decoders. The selection among multiple devices is done through a line decoder circuit [9]. Decoders play an important role in circuit designs, such as carrying out of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Controlled Logic Block (CLB) and memory circuits designs [10]. The optimization of a power consumption in the modular decoder is not mentioned properly in the literature although the decoder has an important role in QCA-based designs. A modular design method for the QCA-based decoder is proposed in this paper to improve the power consumption. Briefly, the important features of this work are as follows: • A modular QCA-based decoder is designed and its efficiency in realizing n to 2n decoders (n > = 2) is explored. • A one-level architecture with tree clocks for reducing the energy consumption of the QCA-based decoder is proposed. • The analysis of the offered design in terms of wire-crossings, delay, number cell, and area are reported. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work and basic terminologies. Section 3 provides the design of the proposed decoder. The proposed decoder is simulated and evaluated in Section 4. Conclusions and future studies are discussed in the last section. 2 Background and related work This section reviews some background materials and related work in order to understand the structure of QCA and state–of–the–art designs. 2.1 QCA technology The QCA technology is based on new design concept [2]. Four charged containers are placed at the corners of a square in QCA [11]. Two extra mobile electrons move in the cell by tunneling between dots. Columbic repulsion makes the cell a bi-state device, as shown in Fig. 1 [12]. The assignment of the QCA cells in a particular pattern relates the ground state of the system with a logic function [13]. Binary wires and inverter chains are employed as interconnections for QCA circuits [14–18]. For having a better stability in QCA structures, it is necessary to have an efficient interconnection between components. For this reason, wire crossing is a significant issue in QCA circuit design [19,20]. Both 45-degree and 90-degree QCA cells are required for performing single –layer crossing [21,22]. Each one is dedicated to one side of a crossing, as shown in Fig. 2 . These different cells can pass over the crossing without any significant effect on each other [19,20]. Multi-layer crossing uses only 45-degree cells or 90-degree ones [19]. The majority voter and inverter circuits are considered as the basic logic devices for QCA [14–18]. Inverter types are shown in Fig. 3 . A 3-input majority gate is the most important gate in QCA [4,23]. It has three inputs and one output as shown in Fig. 4 (a). Three inputs labeled A, B, and E, an output cell, and one middle cell are included in this design. Also, a schematic of the 3-input majority gate is depicted in Fig. 4(b). A 5-input majority gate as a most important gate in QCA must have five inputs and one output as shown in Fig. 5 (c). Five inputs labeled A, B, C, D and E, an output cell and four middle cells labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4 are included in this design. The input cells have stable polarization. The middle cells and output cell are changeable. Also, a schematic of the 5-input majority gate is depicted in Fig. 5(d). A 3-input AND gate and a 3-input OR gate can be realized by means of this majority gate [18]. Four clock phases such as a switch, hold, release and relax are included in QCA cell which is shown in Fig. 6 . QCA cells are unpolarized during the switch phase and they have low inter-dot potential barriers. The position of their drivers (their input cells) makes the QCA cells to be polarized. This clock phase makes the actual computation. The high barriers stop electron tunneling at the end of the clock phase which causes to have fixed cell states [24,26]. 2.2 Power dissipation model Timber and Lent [16] have developed the first power formalism for QCA. [27]. The total energy and a power of QCA cell are measured by the Hamiltonian matrix. The Hamiltonian for an array of QCA cells is presented using Hartree–Fock approximation [28] and the Columbic interaction between cells by a mean-field approach is exposed as [27,29]: (1) H = - E K 2 ∑ i C i f i , j - γ - γ E K 2 ∑ i C i f i , j = - E K 2 ∑ i ( C j - 1 + C j + 1 ) - γ - γ E K 2 ∑ i ( C j - 1 + C j + 1 ) Where Ci is the polarization of the ith juxtaposed cell and fi,j is the geometrical factor specifying the electrostatic interaction between cells (i and j). In the case of similarly neighboring cells, fi,j is absorbed into the Kink energy definition (Ek ). This energy is related to the energy cost of two QCA cells (i and j) having opposite polarizations and can be calculated as [30]: (2) E i , j = 1 4 Π ε 0 ε r ∑ n = 1 4 ∑ m = 1 4 q i , n q j , m r i , n - r j , m Furthermore, the expectation value for QCA cell energy at each clock cycle is calculated as [29]: (3) E = H = ℏ 2 . Γ → . λ → Where Γ → is the energy environment vector of the cell including its neighbor’s effects, ℏ is reduced Planck constant, and λ → represents the coherence vector. Also, the Hamiltonian vector is obtained via Eq. (4): (4) Γ → = 1 ℏ - 2 γ , 0 , E k C j - 1 + C j + 1 Where C j - 1 + C j + 1 is the sum of neighboring polarizations. As illustrated in Fig. 7 , the QCA cell power located in a binary wire is divided into the four main signal flows. As demonstrated in [27,31], the horizontal signal powers are equal, where P i n is the attained signal power from the left neighboring cell and P o u t is the released signal power to the right side cell. As mentioned earlier, in the switch phase, inter-dot barriers are slowly raised causing to transfer of a large amount of energy to the cell ( P c l o c k ) and in the release phase, these barriers are fallen, consequently, the energy is returned to the clocking circuit. Therefore, there is a negligible power dissipation in a clocking circuit called P d i s s [16,29]. Furthermore, instantaneous total power equation for a single QCA cell is obtained as: (5) P i = d E d t = ℏ 2 d Γ → d t . λ → + ℏ 2 Γ → . d λ → d t = P 1 + P 2 Where P 1 includes two main components: first, the power is attained from the difference of the input and output signal powers ( P i n - P o u t ), second, the transferred clocking power to the cell ( P c l o c k ). Also, P2 represents P d i s s [31]. Based on [27], the energy dissipation in one clock cycle, T c c = - T , T , can be represented as Hamiltonian and Coherence vectors [27]: (6) E d i s s = ℏ 2 ∫ - T T Γ → . d λ → d t d t = ℏ 2 Γ → . λ → - T T - ∫ - T T λ → . d Γ → d t d t It is notable that extreme energy dissipation will occur when the changing rate of Γ → is maximum. So, by representing Γ → - and Γ → + as Γ → ( + T ) and Γ → ( - T ) , the upper bound power dissipation model is given as [31]: (7) P d i s s = E d i s s T C C < ℏ 2 T C C Γ → + × - Γ → + Γ → + t a n h ℏ Γ → + K B T + Γ → - Γ → _ t a n h ℏ Γ → _ K B T Where kB represents the Boltzmann constant and T represents the temperature. In an array of similar QCA cells, the total dissipated power can be calculated by adding the dissipated power of all cells when each QCA cell have the same presented model [29,32]. 2.3 QCA–based decoder designs Researchers have made several attempts to design efficient QCA-based decoders. The construction of 4-to-16 decoder relies on a modular design methodology which is proposed in [32]. The latency of this decoder is only five clock cycles. A solution is suggested to the problem by symmetrical fan out where there is no wire crossing. Five 2-to-4 decoders in a tree structure are required to build a 4-to-16 decoder using AND, and delay (modular) blocks. Eight 2-input AND gates are used in each decoder. Enabling or disabling output is possible via four of eight AND gates. Three-input majority gates perform a 2-to-4 decoder. Three additional A, B, and EN rails and four additional 2-input AND gates have made the circuit structure and a decoder to be the same. The logical functionality is as follows: If the enable rail is high (logic ‘1’), it activates the 2-to-4 decoder as normal operation; otherwise, it deactivates the decoder and forces all outputs to logic ‘0’. The top rail carries the signal EN, middle rail carries the signal B, and lower rail carries the signal A. Inversion chains are used to invert A and B. A single clock zone can use three or more rails with coplanar interconnections. 318 cells are used for each 2-to-4 decoder. The 2-to-4 decoder that is used in design has a high cell number and AND gates. The operation of the 2-to-4 decoder of this design takes one clock cycle. In [33], a new modular-based design methodology is presented for QCA. The basic block of QCA cells for logic computation is considered as a tile. In general, a tile can have many different topologies in the QCA layout. For generating stable and synthesis-amenable logic functions, a tile must have the following features: (1) logic functions must have flexible tile at high polarization level. The interactions from unwanted external cells are limited by strong tile. (2) Signals should be routed easily between and among tiles such as Manhattan strategy. (3) A tile should have stable signals, in which an output should not suffer from the lack of polarization or the presence of a glitch. The non-fully populated tile is defined as a tile in which one or more QCA cells are undeposited. By adding input and output cells to the 3 × 3 grid, five different tiles can be constructed. The 3 × 3 grid occupies the same area in the layout as an inverter voter or majority voter (with no input/output cells). Three majority voter gates present the QCA-based decoder. Three baseline tiles, seven double fan-out tiles, six orthogonal tiles are also used in this design. The interconnection tiles as wires are used to connect these tiles. The 2-to-4 decoder using the 3 × 3 grid as part of the tile achieves a reduction in an area and in the number of clocking zones. This design has 588 cells. A 4-to-16 decoder in [7] has five-layered structure. The inputs are placed in the middle layer (layer 3) moving up and down. A 7-input majority gate is used as 4-input AND gate in the decoder design. For each different input, the decoder gives 16 different outputs (0–15), which address the memory cells. There is the same clock vertically in all layers due to layer clocking. The decoder of one clock cycle has low latency in comparison with other decoders. The cell count and latency are reduced by high input majority gates in different layers compared to other designs. Furthermore, developing XOR gate in order to design a 2-to-4 decoder has been proposed in [34]. The synchronization of the entire circuit requires 4 clock zones or 1 clock cycle. In this design, the outputs of any majority voter act as the input to the next majority voter at the same clock zone. Thus, the entire circuit has low latency. The performance of 3 to 8 decoder requires the extension of decoder module. The AND operation is derived from 2 to 4 decoder modules to achieve the outputs of the proposed 3 to 8 decoder. The third input in the form of non-inverted and inverted perform AND operations through QCA wires with each of the previously arrived components to derive corresponding outputs. Here, the inputs and outputs of the circuit need wire crossings to be extended. The synchronization of operations needs total 8 clock zones (2 clock cycles). The 4-to-16 counterpart requires similar operations to be carried. This designing decoder results in reducing cell count, wire-crossing, and delay. Finally, in [18], the 3-input majority gate in QCA is used to design the circuit of the 2-to-4 decoder which has eight majority gates. A 5-input majority gate is needed for performing a logical 2-to-4 decoder [14] in QCA. The delay and complexity in the circuit are increased by eight majority gates using traditional methods. Four 5-input majority gates are included in the implemented decoder arrayed as AND. This circuit reaches the output in 7 clock phases (1.75 clock cycles) and includes two inputs and an enabled input. When the EN input is inactive (EN = 0), all output will be passive. When the EN is active (EN = 1), the outputs will appear with respect to inputs A and B. High consistency in the output is provided by the decoder and it becomes a controllable module by EN input 268 cells are included in the 2-to-5 decoder to cover an area of 0.3 lm2. Table 1 shows the performance of the reviewed QCA-based decoder design in terms of area, clock zones, and cell complexity. 3 Proposed design Decoders play a significant role in digital constructions. The look-up table of the 2-to-4 decoder is shown in Table 2 . The logical functionality is as follows: The 2-to-4 decoder is activated as the normal operation when there is high enable rail (logic 1); otherwise, the decoder is deactivated and forces all outputs to logic ‘0’. The top rail carries signal EN, the middle rail carries signal B, and lower rail carry signal A. An initial attempt to design an efficient 2-to-4 decoder is reported in [18]. Five-input majority gates are required for its performance presented in [14]. It assumes seven clock zones. A design with three clock zones is proposed to make it more efficient with less delay. It requires four 5-majority gates and two inverters as shown in Fig. 8 . According to Fig. 8, the proposed decoder is composed of two separate blocks. The first block includes inputs and inverter gate, and the other block includes a five-input majority generates the o u t p u t signal. All of these blocks are implemented in a single layer design. This QCA-based design uses 200 quantum cells. It uses both types of 90° and 45° cell and also reverse Chinese is done. Fig. 9 shows an inversion chain. Each cell in an inversion chain gets its logical value from the previous cell due to coulomb interaction. Inversion chains are suitable for developing bus rails with perpendicularly tapped normal wires as shown in Fig. 9. The placement of the tap defines whether the output X is simply buffered (Fig. 9a) or inverted (Fig. 9b) based on the input A. Also, Fig. 10 shows a majority voter which is used in the proposed structure. This method considers five inputs labeled A, B, C, D, and E, and the output cell which is shown by out. Furthermore, four middle cells labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4 are considered. The input cells have fixed polarization and middle cells and output cell are changeable. In this design, the input cell A only has an effect on middle cell 1. Also, the input cells B and C have only effect on 1, 2, 3 and on 1, 3, 4 middle cells, respectively. In a similar manner, the input cells D and E have an effect on middle cells 2 and 4. The production of five-input majority gate is due to the movement of the majority decision of inputs to the output. This design has coplanar wire crossing. All the inputs (A, B, and EN) are placed in one clock zone, the inputs of majority gates are placed in other clock and the majority gate and output of majority gate are placed in another clock zone. 4 Results The proposed QCA full adder is simulated by means of QCADesigner version 2.0.3 tool and QCAPro. The QCADesigner and QCApro are given in the rest of this section. The simulated parameters are presented in Section 4.2, and 4.3 describes the simulation of the proposed design. The results of the simulation are shown in section 4.4. The comparative results and analysis of energy are described in Sections 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. 4.1 Simulation tools The benefits of different simulation engines are discussed in [36]. QCADesigner is considered as one of these engines to create a rapid and accurate simulation and layout tool for QCA [36]. It is capable of simulating complex QCA circuits on most standard platforms [37,38]. The QCADesigner has been developed at the ATIPS Laboratory of the University of Calgary. This developed project has the ability to be collected and used on a wide range of systems. This project aims to create an easy to use simulation and layout tool accessible freely to the research community via the Internet. The developers are able to join their own utilities into QCADesigner using this design. A standardized method of representing information within the software is provided to complete the project. A standardized calling scheme and data types are needed to combine the simulation engines into QCADesigner [36]. Three simulation engines are included in the present version of QCADesigner. A digital logic simulator as the first simulator considers cells to be either null or fully polarized. The second is a nonlinear approximation engine, which employs the nonlinear cell-to-cell response function to iteratively control the stable state of the cells within a design. A two-state Hamiltonian is used by the third to form an approximation of the full quantum mechanical model of a system [36]. The error and power dissipation in QCA circuit design are estimated by QCAPro [31]. A fast approximation based technique is used to estimate false cells in QCA circuit design [16]. An average, maximum and minimum power loss in a QCA circuit are evaluated by QCAPro during an input switching operation. In this regard, a good platform is offered for researchers who wish to study polarization error and power dissipation related issues in QCA circuits [36]. The tool checks a design and also estimates polarization error at each of the QCA cell for a particular input vector [27]. The output in textual and graphical formats is provided via QCAPro. The correctness of the proposed designs and the estimation of their power consumptions are evaluated by QCADesigner and QCAPro. 4.2 Simulation parameters The simulation engine in QCADesigner must be set to coherence vector type using simulation parameters. Most of these parameters are default values in QCADesigner. A brief description of each parameter used for a simulation engine is shown in Table 3 . 4.3 Design simulation The simulation of the 2-to-4 decoder based QCA with five majority gates is discussed in this section. Fig. 11. shows the layout of the 2-to-4 decoder in QCADesigner. The colored logic elements indicate the different clock zones in Fig. 11. Each of the A, B, and EN inputs are placed in different clock zones. This QCA-based design has 193 quantum cells. It uses both types of 90° and 45° cell and also reverses Chinese is done. This design has coplanar wire crossing to build a 3-to-8 decoder using two 2-to-4 decoders. 4.4 Accuracy analyses The simulation result for the proposed decoder is shown in Fig. 12. The QCA Designer version 2.0.3 with stated default parameters is used to simulate and verify the 2-to-4 decoder in bistable approximation. In this design, A, B, and EN are labeled out1, out2, out3, and out4, respectively. When input cells A, B, and EN have logic 1 values, out4 will have logic 1 values and other outs have logic 0 values. The proposed QCAdecoder works well and has an appropriate performance based on simulation results. 4.5 Comparative results Table 4 describes a comparison between the proposed 2-to-4 decoder gate and the state-of-the-art designs. A great progress happens in cell count (complexity) and the area in comparison to the previous single/multilayer designs. 200 QCA cells are used in the proposed design whereas two good designs use 268 QCA cells as shown in [3]. It shows 75% improvements. The proposed circuit has a low area of the layout. The needed delay for moving the input signals to the output is three which is the minimum clock phase. Therefore, three factors, including area, complexity, and delay are considered to increase the proposed decoder. The QCA cells should be formed and arranged in a way to achieve an efficient and high-performance implementation. Also, the output places are surrounded by other cells, so there is no need of wire crossover to feed into the other circuits. 4.6 Power analyses The highly pipelined architectures with extremely high speed are proposed by QCA computational paradigm. The molecular QCA can be faster than 2.5 THz and theoretically, processing speed may reach to 25 THz [39]. The kink energy plays a major function in power estimation due to its direct and inverse relation with power dissipation and steady-state polarization error. Three different tunneling energy levels, including 0.5 E k , 1 E k , a n d 1.5 E k are used to evaluate the proposed design as well as the previous structures at 2 K temperature. The QCAPro environment is used to perform the power dissipation process. Fig. 13 shows the power dissipation of presented decoder in [18] and the map of the proposed decoder with 0.5 E k is shown in Fig. 14 . A temperature factor is stable in this context. The dimension of the QCA cell, as well as the spacing between the adjacent cells, are changed via the kink energy. The sharp clock transitions are required to compute the power loss in a QCA circuit in [30]. It results in non-adiabatic operations and yields the upper bound of power consumption [31,40]. The thermal layout for average power dissipation at each cell in the 2-to-4 decoder is illustrated in Fig. 14. The worst thermal hot spots in the design are shown by a black mark. The weak spots are considered as the logic cell of the majority voters in the decoder. The dissipation of maximum power (averaged over all input combinations) by hot spots is required to form a thermally stable/tolerant design. Table 5 shows the effect of varying kink energy on the power dissipation through a switching event from one clock zone to other in a decoder circuit. The leakage and switching energies for the proposed decoder and the presented decoder in [18] are shown in Table 5. The kink energy in a circuit and the overall average power dissipation have close relationships. The kink energy improves the output node polarization error but reduces the power dissipation. The average leakage energies of the presented decoder in [18] and the proposed decoder are shown in Fig. 15 . The proposed decoder is better than the presented design in [18] based on the obtained result where it has less leakage energy. Fig. 16 illustrates that the proposed decoder has less switching energy than the presented decoder in [18] by modifying the level of the tunneling energy. 5 Conclusion and future work A new methodology has been proposed to design a modular decoder using QCA technology, which is better than the existing modular decoder in terms of a number of cells, clock zones, and wire-crossings. This study explores a modular approach in designing the higher order decoder by cascading lower order decoders. The rate of power dissipation and output node polarization error should be reduced to ensure a low power modular design. Therefore, designing circuits with less number of cells and complexity are considered as one of the problems. Providing methods such as multi-level designing are helpful to reduce the complexity. At the same time, the fault tolerance of the proposed circuit can be improved in terms of different aspects. Finally, it is possible to offer some solutions to reduce delay.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.027,Conditions required to make gauge-invariant the electromagnetic spin and orbital angular momenta and helicity densities in isotropic and anisotropic media,"Abstract The spin and orbital angular momenta densities ( s n and l n ) and helicity density (hn ) of the electro- magnetic (EM) fields are defined using an electric vector potential C in analogy with the magnetic vector potential A , where C is introduced to observe the duality invariance and electric-magnetic democracy. However, their definitions for s n , l n and hn have an essential drawback (lacking for the gauge invariance) that they vary widely depending on the choice of two kinds of A and C . To solve this problem, it is necessary to make s n , l n and hn gauge-invariant. The gauge invariance for s n , l n and hn in isotropic and anisotropic media can be established by an appropriate combination of gauge functions and scalar potentials. As a result, it is proved in a distinct way from the second quantization procedure that the gauge invariance for s n and l n depending on the phase difference between A and C leads to the quantization of electromagnetic spin. Moreover, the gauge-invariant hn gives a reasonable explanation for the Faraday rotation caused in an anisotropic medium.",Aug-18," PACS 03.50.De 41.20.Jb 42.25.Bs Keywords Electromagnetic wave Spin angular momentum Orbital angular momentum Gauge invariance Helicity 1 Introduction The angular momentum (AM) carried by light can be characterized by the spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with the circular polarization (CP) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) associated with the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic (EM) wave. In practice, both SAM and OAM of a light beam have been measured [1–3]. Theoretically, the old SAM and OAM densities have been defined as s o  = ( D ×  A ) and l o  = Σ i = x , y Di ( r × ∇)Ai for the transverse plane EM waves propagating along the z axis, where the symbol ∇ is the gradient operator, D is the electric induction field and A is the magnetic vector potential defined as B  = ∇ ×  A , where B is the magnetic induction field [4–7].The SAM arises in the transverse plane EM waves, while the OAM never appears there. When the phase gradient satisfies certain conditions providing the transverse energy circulation within the beam, however, the OAM arises sometimes [8,9].On the other hand, the old helicity density ho has been defined as ho  =  H ∙ A for the transverse plane EM waves traveling along the z axis, where H is the magnetic field [10]. The old SAM density s o  = ( D  ×  A ) defined above for the transverse plane EM waves traveling along the z axis does not contain the D and B fields equivalently, resulting in the breakdown of the electric-magnetic democracy [5]. The same applies to the helicity density ho  =  H ∙ A , because E and H fields are not included equivalently in ho . For this reason, the SAM ( s n ), OAM ( l n ) and helicity (hn ) densities are defined here as s n  = [( D  ×  A ) + ( C  ×  B )]/2, l n  = Σ j  =  x, y, z [Dj ( r  × ∇)Aj  − Bj ( r  × ∇)Cj ]/2 and hn  = ( A ∙ H  +  C ∙ E )/2 for the optical fields, to leave invariant under the duality transformations of ( E , H ) ↔ ( H ,−), ( D , B ) ↔ ( B ,−) and ( A , C ) ↔ (− C , A ) which result from the interchange of the electricity and magnetism [11], where E is the electric field and D is defined as D  = ∇ ×  C using an electric vector potential C . There are also similar definitions for the spin density s d and helicity density hd in the dual electromagnetism [12–14]. However, s d and hd are inapplicable to anisotropic media, because they originate basically from the free-field Maxwell’s equations. It will be shown here that hn defined here gives a reasonable explanation for the Faraday rotation caused in an optically active medium [15]. As is clear from the total angular momentum density j defined as j =  r  × ( D  ×  B ) for the optical fields [13], j is invariant under the gauge transformation, but both s o and l o generated [5,6,14] by the partial integration of j due to the introduction of the vector potential A lack generally a gauge invariance. Even if s o and l o are improved to have both duality invariance and electric-magnetic democracy, their gauge invariances are not recovered at all. This is because the physical quantities of s n , l n and hn which are defined above vary significantly depending on the choice of two kinds of A and C . In general, the observable physical quantity must be invariant under the gauge transformation. For this reason, it is investigated here whether the gauge invariances for s n , l n and hn can be established by an appropriate combination of gauge functions and scalar potentials contributing to A and C and what conditions are required to acquire the gauge invariance in isotropic and anisotropic media. The first purpose of this study is to find the conditions required to make s n , l n and hn gauge-invariant, and the second one is to show that hn gives a reasonable explanation for the Faraday rotation occurring in an anisotropic (opticall active) medium. 2 Analysis 2.1 Maxwell’s equations The Maxwell equations for the EM fields in the absence of free charges or electric currents are given in SI units by [16] (1) ∇ × E = − ∂ B ∂ t , (2) ∇ × H = − ∂ D ∂ t , (3) ∇ ⋅ B = 0 (4) ∇ ⋅ D = 0 where the electric D and magnetic B inductions are related to the field strengths E and H through D  = ε E and B  = μ H , where ε and μ represent the permittivity and permeability tensors, respectively. Maxwell’s equations in the absence of free charges or electric currents are invariant by putting ( E , H ) → ( H , – E ) and ( D , B ) → ( B , – D ) in the optical fields. This duality transformation leaves quadratic forms such as ( E  ×  H ), ( E · D  +  H · B ) and the components of the Maxwell stress tensor Tij invariant, where i, j = x, y and z [16]. The Maxwell’s equations have an important feature that they are invariant under the duality and gauge transformations. 2.2 Old spin and orbital angular momenta in an isotropic medium The total angular momentum J of the EM fields has been defined as [16] (5) J = ∫ τ r × D × B dv = ∫ τ j d v in analogy to the interpretation of the linear momentum density ( D  ×  B ), where j is the angular momentum density and is gauge-invariant. Here a medium is assumed to be loss-free and homogeneous. This definition is invariant under the duality transformation and is valid at least when the medium is linear but not necessarily isotropic in its response. The magnetic induction field B is expressed by the magnetic vector potential A as [16] (6) B = ∇ × A . By substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (5), the old SAM ( S o ) and OAM ( L o ) for EM waves traveling along the z direction in an isotropic medium have been described as [4–7] (7) S o = ∫ τ d v s o = ∫ τ d v D × A and (8) L o = ∫ τ dv l o = ∫ τ dv Σ j = x , y , z D j ( r × ∇ ) A j , where τ is a volume integrated over the wave packet along the trajectory. As is clear from Eqs.(7) and (8), the old SAM and OAM densities ( s o and l o ) do not contain equivalently D and B fields, resulting in the breakdown of the electric-magnetic democracy. This is because D and B fields are not treated on equivalent footing in defining s o and l o . The electric field E is expressed by substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (1) as [16] (9) E = − ∂ A ∂ t − ∇ φ , where φ is the electric scalar potential dependent on position and time. It is possible to transform the vector and scalar potentials ( A 0 and φ 0) into another pair ( A and φ) by means of the simultaneous gauge transformations, leaving the EM fields invariant; (10) A = A 0 + ∇ u , (11) φ = φ 0 − ∂ u ∂ t , where u is an arbitrary scalar function which is called a gauge function [16]. The physical quantities independent of the gauge function are said to be gauge-invariant. Basically, all physical observables are required to be gauge-invariant. If A 0 and φ 0 are respectively the vector and scalar potentials intrinsic to describe the EM fields, the vector and scalar potentials ( A and φ) generated newly by means of the simultaneous gauge transformations also produce the same fields as the original ones. Two pairs of ( A , φ) and ( A 0, φ 0) are then called gauge-equivalent, so that E can be expressed using A 0 and φ 0 as (12) E = − ∂ A 0 ∂ t − ∇ φ . When the transverse plane EM waves are traveling linearly in an isotropic medium, S o and L o are effectively decoupled, because the intrinsic L o vanishes completely for transverse plane waves. In general, the old s o and l o vary significantly depending on the choice of A and φ, so that they are gauge-variant. This cause for lacking the gauge invariance is that only one kind of vector potential is included in the old definitions of the SAM and OAM densities, leading to a lack of the electric-magnetic democracy. 2.3 New spin and orbital angular momenta in an isotropic medium In order to define newly the SAM and OAM densities for the transverse plane EM waves traveling in an isotropic medium, we have introduced an electric vector potential C defined as [11,17] (13) D = ∇ × C . This replacement of the electric flux density D with the electric vector potential C is permitted in the optical fields. Substituting Eqs. (6) and (13) into Eq. (5) separately and dividing their summation by two, the total angular momentum J n is expressed as (14) J n = S n + L n , where (15) S n = ∫ τ d v s n = 1 2 ∫ τ d v [ ( D × A ) + ( C × B ) ] and (16) L n = ∫ τ d v l n = 1 2 ∫ τ d v Σ j = x , y , z [ D j ( r × ∇ ) A j – B j ( r × ∇ ) C j ] , where S n and L n are integrated over the wave packet along the trajectory and s n and l n are new SAM and OAM densities, respectively [11]. Substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (2), the magnetic field H is expressed as (17) H = ∂ C ∂ t − ∇ ψ . in a similar expression to Eq. (9), where ψ is the magnetic scalar potential. It is possible to transform the vectors and scalar potentials ( C 0 and ψ 0) into another pair ( C and ψ) so as not to change the EM fields by means of the following gauge transformations (18) C = C 0 – ∇ υ , (19) ψ = ψ 0 ∂ υ ∂ t where υ is an arbitrary gauge function analogous to u. If C 0 and ψ 0 bring forth an optical field, the vector and scalar potentials ( C and ψ) generated by means of the gauge transformations also produce the same optical field for any function of υ, leaving s n and l n invariant. The gauge equivalence is also established for ( C , ψ) and ( C 0, ψ 0), so that H can be expressed using C 0 and ψ 0 as (20) H = ∂ C 0 ∂ t – ∇ ψ 0 . When Eqs. (14) and (15) contain D and B equivalently, both s n and l n can be invariant under the duality transformation such as ( D , B ) → ( B , – D ) and ( A , C ) → (– C , A ) [11]. The requirement of the duality invariance results from the observance of the electric-magnetic democracy. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The gauge transformations of s n and l n in an isotropic medium 3.1.1 s n It is investigated in this section what conditions are necessary to make s n and l n gauge-invariant for the transverse plane EM waves traveling in an isotropic medium. The SAM density s n defined for the optical fields is expressed as [11,17] (21) s n = 1 2 [ ( D × A ) + ( C × B ) ] , where D =ε 0 E and B =μ 0 H . Using these relations, s n is expressed as functions of electric and magnetic vector potentials and their vector fields as (22) s n = 1 2 [ ε 0 ( E × A ) + μ 0 ( C × H ) ] . Further substitutions of Eqs. (10), (12), (18) and (20) into Eq. (22) yield the following expression (23) s n = 1 2 { [ ε 0 ( A 0 × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) + μ 0 ( C 0 × ∂ C 0 ∂ t ) ] + [ ε 0 ( ∇ u × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) + μ 0 ( ∂ C 0 ∂ t × ∇ υ ) ] + [ ε 0 ( A 0 × ∇ φ 0 ) + μ 0 ( ∇ ψ 0 × C 0 ) ] } = s e + s g , where (24) s g = 1 2 [ ε 0 ( A 0 × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) + μ 0 ( C 0 × ∂ C 0 ∂ t ) ] and (25) s g = 1 2 { [ ε 0 ( ∇ u × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) + μ 0 ( ∂ C 0 ∂ t × ∇ υ ) ] + [ ε 0 ( A 0 × ∇ φ 0 ) + μ 0 ( ∇ ψ 0 × C 0 ) ] } , where s e is the effective SAM density and s g is the apparent SAM density associated with the gauge and scalar functions. It should be noted here that A 0 and C 0 are intrinsic vector potentials indispensable to reproduce the optical fields exactly. Here, two cross products (∇ φ 0 × ∇ u) and (∇ υ × ∇ ψ 0) appeared on the right hand side of Eq. (25) are dropped because the vector products between the same gradient operators vanish. The two terms in the former bracket on the right hand side of Eq. (25) are associated directly with gauge functions u and υ, and two terms in the latter one are related with indefinite scalar potentials φ 0 and ψ 0. Now the condition necessary to make s n gauge-invariant is that s g disappears but s e survives for any combination of A 0 and C 0. In other words, s g disappears necessarily when the inner products of ( s g · A 0) and ( s g · C 0) become equal to zero simultaneously. Using a simple vector algebra, their conditions are expressed as (26) ( s g · A 0 ) = μ 0 ( C 0 × A 0 ) ∇ ψ 0 + μ 0 ( A 0 × ∂ C 0 ∂ t × C 0 ) ∇ υ + ε 0 ( ∂ A 0 ∂ t × A 0 ) ∇ u = 0 and (27) ( s g · C 0 ) = ε 0 ( C 0 × A 0 ) ∇ φ 0 + ε 0 ( ∂ A 0 ∂ t × C 0 ) ∇ u + μ 0 ( C 0 × ∂ C 0 ∂ t ∇ υ = 0. Dividing Eq. (26) by E 0 and Eq. (27) by H 0, both expressions have the same physical unit. In order to take a phase difference between Eqs. (26) and (27) into account, after multiplying Eq. (26) by a phase factor ei α and adding it to Eq. (27), the following expression is obtained as (28) ( μ 0 E 0 e i a ∇ ψ 0 + ε 0 H 0 ∇ φ 0 ) ⋅ ( C 0 × A 0 ) – ( A 0 E 0 e i a + C 0 H 0 ) × ( μ 0 ∇ υ × ∂ C 0 ∂ t – ε 0 ∇ u × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) = 0 , where α is a phase difference between A 0 and C 0. In order for this equation to establish under any condition, therefore, it is necessary to disappear four parentheses in Eq. (28). For this reason, to begin with, two parentheses which are associated with a set of φ 0 and ψ 0 and that of u and υ in Eq. (28) need to satisfy simultaneously the following two equations (29) ( μ 0 E 0 e i a ∇ ψ 0 + ε 0 H 0 ∇ φ 0 ) = 0 and (30) ( μ 0 ∇ υ × ∂ C 0 ∂ t – ε 0 ∇ u × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) = 0. When these two equations are not satisfied at the same time, however, it is further necessary to satisfy simultaneously the following two equations including only a set of A 0 and C 0 in Eq. (28), (31) ( C 0 × A 0 ) = 0 and (32) ( A 0 E 0 e i a + C 0 H 0 ) = 0. By multiplying Eq. (32) by A 0 and by C 0, respectively, and summing up them after some manipulations, the following equation is derived as (33) ( A 0 · C 0 ) ( e i α E 0 + e − i α H 0 ) + [ ( A 0 · A 0 ) E 0 + ( C 0 · C 0 ) H 0 ] = 0. In general, the complex vectors and real vectors have completely different properties. For example, in real vector algebra, ( A 0· A 0) = 0 implies A 0 = 0, while in complex vector algebra, A 0 represents the circular polarization (CP). If the complex vectors A 0 and C 0 satisfy simultaneously ( C 0 ×  A 0) = 0 and ( A 0· C 0) = ( A 0· A 0) = ( C 0· C 0) = 0 in Eqs. (31) and (33), they are CP and multiplies of each other [18]. It means that A 0 and C 0 form a circular polarization with a phase difference α. Substituting C 0 derived from Eq. (32) into Eq. (30), ∇ u and ∇ υ are linked to each other as (34) ( μ 0 E 0 e i α ∇ υ + ε 0 H 0 ∇ u ) = 0. The combination of Eq. (29) and Eq. (34) yields (35) ∇ u · ∇ ψ 0 = ∇ υ · ∇ φ 0 . This is just a condition that s g disappears, i.e., a condition that makes s n and hn gauge-invariant for the transverse plane EM waves propagating linearly in an isotropic medium. It also leads to the demonstration of the gauge invariance for the helicity density hn , as shown in Appendix A. These results are listed in Table 1 . For example, the condition of ∇ u = ∇ υ = ∇ ψ 0 = ∇ φ 0 = 0 meeting to Eq. (35) is indeed referred to as the radiation gauge [16]. While Eq. (35) is fulfilled, therefore, the gauge invariance holds for s n in an isotropic medium, despite the phase difference (α) between A 0 and C 0 is indefinite. The acquirement of this gauge invariance for s n is attributed to the presence of two kinds of vector potentials ( A 0 and C 0), because s g survives without disappearing in the presence of the sole magnetic vector potential A 0. When s g  = 0, however, s n can be described exactly by only two kinds of vector potentials ( A 0 and C 0) without u, υ, φ 0 and ψ 0. 3.1.2 l n As mentioned above, the OAM density l n defined here is expressed as (36) l n = 1 2 Σ j = x , y , z [ D j ( r × ∇ ) A j – B j ( r × ∇ ) C j ] . If the EM fields are composed of the transverse plane EM waves propagating along the z axis, all of E , H , A and C fields are rotating around the optical axis in the x-y plane and have no component along the z axis. However, some of the electric and magnetic field components of their fields based on scalar potentials should have z component at least when the gauge invariance of l n is established. In such EM fields, therefore, Eq. (36) can be decomposed into two components of effective OAM density l e and apparent OAM density l g which are respectively perpendicular and parallel to the z axis, regardless of whether a medium is isotropic or anisotropic. Under such conditions, D and B fields can be derived from Eqs.(12) and (20) as (37) D j = x , y = – ε 0 ∂ A 0 j / ∂ t , B j = x , y = μ 0 ∂ A 0 j / ∂ t , D z = – ε 0 ∇ φ 0 , B z = – μ 0 ∇ ψ 0 , where the symbol ∇ is a scalar operator which denotes a derivative of ∂/∂z. Substituting Eq. (37) into Eq. (36), l n is decomposed into two parts of l e (associated with a set of A 0 and C 0) and l g (associated with a series of φ 0, ψ 0, u and υ) as (38) l n = – 1 2 { Σ j = x , y [ ε 0 ∂ A 0 j ∂ t ( r × ∇ ) A 0 j + μ 0 ∂ C 0 j ∂ t ( r × ∇ ) C 0 j ] + [ ε 0 ∇ φ 0 ( r × ∇ ) ∇ u + μ 0 ∇ ψ 0 ( r × ∇ ) ∇ υ ] } (39) = l e + l g . When l g  = 0, therefore, l n becomes gauge-invariant only when it can be described by only two kinds of vector potentials ( A 0 and C 0). Next, we investigate here what conditions are necessary to disappear l g in an isotropic medium. For the transverse plane EM waves propagating along the z axis, l g is derived from Eq. (38) as (40) l g = 1 2 ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) ( ε 0 ∇ φ 0 Δ u + μ 0 ∇ ψ 0 Δ υ ) , where the symbol Δ denotes a second derivative of ∂2/∂z 2. The substitution of Eq. (34) into Eq. (40) yields (41) l g = 1 2 ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) μ 0 Δ υ ( ∇ ψ 0 – H 0 E 0 e i α ∇ φ 0 ) . Further substitutions of ∇φ 0 and ∇ψ 0 derived from Eq. (29) into Eq. (41) produce (42) l g = 1 2 ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) μ 0 Δ υ ∇ ψ 0 ( 1 + e i 2 α ) = 1 2 ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) ε 0 Δ u ∇ φ 0 ( 1 + e − i 2 α ) . When any one of ∇ψ 0 = ∇φ 0 = 0, ∇u = ∇υ = 0 and ei 2 α  = –1 holds, Eq. (42) gets to zero. When any one of the former two conditions holds, l g disappears regardless of the value of α. The last condition (ei 2 α  = –1) among them leads to the quantization (α = ±π/2) of the phase difference between A 0 and C 0 in an isotropic medium. This is quite the same as the condition required for the gauge invariance of s n in an anisotropic medium, as will be shown later. In a homogeneous isotropic medium, when l g  = 0, l n (= l e ) can then be expressed by either a set of ∂ A 0/∂t and ∂ C 0/∂t or a set of E and H as (43) l g = ε 0 μ 0 ( ∂ C 0 ∂ t × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) z ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) = ε 0 μ 0 E × H z ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) . It is thus found that when l g  = 0, l n also becomes invariant under the simultaneous gauge transformations in a homogeneous isotropic medium, like s n . 3.2 The gauge transformations of s n and l n in an anisotropic (optically active) medium 3.2.1 s n It is examined in this subsection what conditions are necessary to make s n and l n gauge-invariant in an anisotropic (optically active) medium. Here we consider the incident plane wave to be a superposition of the right circularly polarized (RCP) and left circularly polarized (LCP) waves with equal amplitude. The complex ε and μ tensors of a uniaxial medium with threefold or higher rotational symmetry about the z axis are represented by Hermite matrices as (44) ε = ε 0 – i ε 1 0 + i ε 1 ε 0 0 0 0 ε z and μ = μ 0 – i κ 0 + i κ μ 0 0 0 0 μ z , where the symbols ε 0, ε 1, μ 0 and κ are adopted to conform to accepted conventions and εz and μz are z component of their tensors [19]. When the linearly polarized incident wave traveling along the z axis entered such a medium, it splits to the RCP and LCP waves in a medium [20]. The circulating vectors (such as Er and Eℓ ) with the subscripts “r” and “ℓ” represent clockwise and counterclockwise rotations in the x-y plane, respectively, when the plane is viewed from –z to +z direction. The D and B induction fields in such a medium are expressed as (45) D = Σ i , j = x , y ε i j E j e i And (46) B = Σ i , j = x , y μ i j H j e i . where εij and μij are the complex ε and μ tensors described in Eq. (44). The substitutions of Eqs. (45) and (46) into Eq. (21) yield (47) s n = 1 2 { [ ε 0 ( E × A ) + μ 0 ( C × H ) + i κ C · H – ε 1 E · A ] e 3 } . where e 3 is a unit vector pointing in the z direction. Further substitutions of Eqs. (10), (12), (18) and (20) into Eq. (47) give (48) s n = s e + s g + s a , where s e and s g are respectively expressed by Eqs. (24) and (25) and s a is the anisotropic spin density associated with non-diagonal elements (ε 1 and κ) which is expressed as (49) s a = 1 2 [ κ ( ∂ C 0 ∂ t · C 0 + ∇ ψ 0 · ∇ υ ) + ε 1 ( ∂ A 0 ∂ t · A 0 + ∇ φ 0 · ∇ u ) ] e 3 , where all terms of ∇ φ 0· C 0, ∇ υ·∂ C 0/∂t, ∇ ψ 0· A 0 and ∇ u·∂ A 0/∂t are dropped because of inner products between orthogonal vectors. Substituting Eqs. (29), (32) and (34) into Eq. (49), it is rewritten using either a set of A 0, ∇ φ 0 and ∇ u or a set of C 0, ∇ ψ 0 and ∇ υ as (50) s a = i 2 μ 0 ( κ · ε 0 e i 2 α + ε 1 · μ 0 ) ( ∂ A 0 ∂ t · A 0 + ∇ φ 0 · ∇ u ) e 3 and (51) s a = i 2 ε 0 e − i 2 α ( κ · ε 0 e i 2 α + ε 1 · μ 0 ) ( ∂ C 0 ∂ t · C 0 + ∇ ψ 0 · ∇ υ ) e 3 . In order to make s n gauge-invariant in an optically active medium, it is necessary to vanish s a . When α satisfies (κ·ε 0 ei 2 α +ε 1·μ 0) = 0 in Eqs. (50) and (51), s a disappears regardless of the vector and scalar potentials and gauge functions, so that the gauge invariance of s n is established in an anisotropic medium. When (κ·ε 0 ei 2 α +ε 1·μ 0) ≠0, however, the following two conditions need to be fulfilled simultaneously to make s n gauge-invaraint (52) ∂ C 0 ∂ t · C 0 + ∇ ψ 0 · ∇ υ = 0 and (53) ∂ A 0 ∂ t · A 0 + ∇ φ 0 · ∇ u = 0. The substitution of C 0 derived from Eq. (32) into Eq. (52) yields (54) ε 0 μ 0 ∂ A 0 ∂ t A 0 e i 2 α + ∇ ψ 0 · ∇ υ = 0 , where we made use of the relation (H 0 /E 0) = (ε 0 /μ 0)1/2 [11]. Further substitution of (∂ A 0/∂t)· A 0 derived from Eq. (53) into Eq. (54) produces (55) ε 0 μ 0 e i 2 α – ∇ ψ 0 ∇ φ 0 ∇ υ ∇ u = 0. The combination of Eq. (55) with Eq. (35) yields (56) ε 0 μ 0 e i 2 α – ( ∇ υ ) 2 ( ∇ u ) 2 = ε 0 μ 0 ( e i 2 α – e − i 2 α ) = 0 , where we made use of the relation [∇ υ/∇ u = –(ε 0 /μ 0)1/2 e − iα ] derived from Eq. (34) [11]. There are two kinds of solutions for Eq. (56): ei 2 α  = +1 or –1, where the former has a phase difference (between A 0 and C 0) of α = 0, while the latter gives α = ±π/2. When α = 0, both Eqs. (52) and (53) must hold in order to vanish s a , because of κ·ε 0+ε 1·μ 0≠0. In the case of α = ±π/2, however, s a gets to zero only when the relation κ·ε 0 = ε 1·μ 0 holds or Eqs. (52) and (53) are established. In either case of α = 0 or α = ±π/2, therefore, both s g  = 0 and s a  = 0 are satisfied, because Eq. (35) holds regardless of the value of α. The condition required to make s n gauge-invariant in an anisotropic (optically active) medium (see Table 1) is the observance of the relationship ∇ u·∇ ψ 0 = ∇ υ·∇ φ 0, as listed in Table 1. The presence of non-diagonal elements in ε and μ tensors is thus found to make possible the quantization of the phase difference. Subsequently, in order to find out which of eiα  = –i and eiα  = +  corresponds to RCP or LCP wave, two kinds of vector potentials A 0 and C 0 are employed as follows (57) A 0 = E 0 2 ω e − i ω t [ − i ( e i k r z + e i k ℓ z ) e 1 + ( e i k r z − e i k ℓ z ) e 2 ] and (58) C 0 = H 0 2 ω e − i ω t [ ( e i k r z − e i k ℓ z ) e 1 + i ( e i k r z + e i k ℓ z ) e 2 ] , where A 0 and C 0 are composed of both RCP and LCP waves and kr and kℓ are the wave vectors of RCP and LCP waves, respectively [11]. By substituting Eqs. (57) and (58) into Eq. (32), the phase factor ei α is linked with both RCP and LCP waves as (59) ( A 0 E 0 e i α + C 0 H 0 ) = – i e − i ω t √ 2 ω [ e i k r z ( e i α + i ) e r + e i k ℓ z ( e i α – i ) e ℓ ] = 0 , where e r = ( e 1+ i e 2)/√2 and e ℓ = ( e 1– i e 2)/√2 [21]. In order for Eq. (59) to hold usually, the relations eiα  = –i and eiα  = +  correspond respectively to LCP (α = –π/2) and RCP (α = +π/2) waves, because there is no solution of α which satisfies both relations at the same time. Substituting Eqs. (57) and (58) into Eq. (24) and taking their complex conjugates, the gauge-invariant se is obtained as se  = (ε 0 E 2 + μ 0 H 2)/2ω for α = +π/2. On the other hand, sn is derived as sn  = ℏ/V using the second quantization method, where V is an arbitrary volume [4]. It is found from se  = sn that the gauge invariance of s n leads to the quantization of electromagnetic spin, resulting in a photon spin S = ℏ. Then, the anisotropy in ε and μ tensors contributes to the generation of quantization axis (z axis) of spin. When A 0 and C 0 are respectively described by Eqs. (57) and (58), C 0 lags behind A 0 by π/2 in each rotation direction for RCP and LCP waves, as shown in Fig. 1 . The gauge invariance of s n in an anisotropic medium result from the quantization (α = ±π/2) of phase difference between A 0 and C 0. From a macroscopic point of view, therefore, an appearance of LP (linear polarization) or EP (elliptical polarization) wave is only possible for a light beam, because LP and EP waves can be constructed as a composite wave by an appropriate linear combination of CP waves with opposite helicities. The conditions necessary for the gauge invariance are as follows: one condition for generating s g  = 0 is ∇ u·∇ ψ 0 = ∇ υ·∇ φ 0 in an isotropic medium, while in an anisotropic (optically active) medium, another condition for establishing s a  = 0 is α = ±π/2, as listed in Table 1. While the gauge symmetry is established, however, the spin direction of a massless particle is limited to either parallel or antiparallel to the traveling direction, because the gauge field must be massless [22]. 3.2.2 l n When the transverse plane EM waves are propagating along the z axis in an anisotropic medium, most of E , H , A and C fields are in the x-y plane but some of their field components derived from the gauge functions should have somewhat z component in the gauge-invariant state. Under such conditions, x and y components of D and B fields are expressed by Eqs.(45) and (46) and their z components are derived from Eqs. (12) and (20) as (60) D z = – ε z ∇ φ 0 , B z = – μ z ∇ ψ 0 . Substituting Eqs. (45),(46) and (60) into Eq. (36), l n is decomposed into two parts of l e (associated with E and H ) and l g (associated with the gauge functions) as (61) l n = l e + l g , where (62) l e = ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) [ ( ε 0 μ 0 – ε 1 κ ) E × H z + i ( ε 0 κ – ε 1 μ 0 ) ( E ⋅ H ) ] and (63) l g = – 1 2 ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) ( ε z ∇ φ 0 Δ u + μ z ∇ ψ 0 Δ υ ) , where the symbols ∇ and Δ denote the first and second derivatives of ∂/∂z and ∂2/∂z 2, respectively. Of course, Eq. (62) is reduced to Eq. (43), at least when both ε 1 = 0 and κ = 0 are realized. Here Δu is derived from the differentiation of Eq. (34) with respect to z as (64) Δ u = – ( μ 0 / ε 0 ) 1 / 2 e i α Δ υ . Substitutions of ∇ψ 0 (or ∇φ 0) derived from Eq. (29) and of Δu (or Δυ) from Eq. (64) into Eq. (63) yield l g for the transverse plane EM waves traveling in an anisotropic medium (65) l g = ( y e 1 – x e 2 ) ( μ 0 / ε 0 ) 1 / 2 ε z e − i α [ e i 2 α + ( ε 0 μ z / μ 0 ε z ) ] ∇ φ 0 Δ υ . and (66) l g = 1 2 y e 1 − x e 2 ε 0 / μ 0 1 / 2 μ z e i a e − i 2 a + μ 0 / ε 0 μ z ∇ ψ 0 Δ u . These two equations are reduced to Eq. (42) for εz  = ε 0 and μz  = μ 0. When Eq. (42) is combined with Eqs. (65) and (66) and any one of ∇ψ 0 = ∇φ 0 = 0 or ∇u = ∇υ = 0 holds, l g disappears in either isotropic or anisotropic medum. Furthermore, when α satisfies ei 2 α  = –(ε 0 μz /μ 0 εz ), l g vanishes, leading to the gauge invariance of l n in an anisotropic medium. This means that α is quantized at a phase difference shifted somewhat from π/2. It indicates that when l n is described using only two kinds of vector potentials ( A 0 and C 0), it can be gauge-invariant even in an anisotropic medium. It is thus found that two kinds of vector potentials of A 0 and C 0 are indispensable to make s n and l n gauge-invariant, whether the medium is isotropic or not. In addition, it was found in a different way from the traditional procedure that the phase difference α between A 0 and C 0 can be quantized successfully by imposing the gauge invariance on s n and l n which are respectively generated in isotropic and anisotropic media, as listed in Table 1. The success of phase quantization due to the gauge invariance seems to suggest indirectly the existence of an electric vector potential. The existence of the magnetic vector potential A has indeed been confirmed through the A-B effect of electrons moving in the vector potential A produced by the solenoid [23]. By analogy with the magnetic vector potential A , the existence of electric vector potential C would probably be confirmed someday by a similar experiment due to a magnetic fluxon [24]. 3.3 The continuity and torque equations for hn 3.3.1 Continuity equation The helicity density hn defined here for the optical fields is duality-invariant and given by [11] (67) h n = 1 2 [ A · H + ( C · E ) ] , where the first and second terms in the bracket are referred to as the magnetic helicity [10] and the electric helicity [17], respectively. The helicity density hn in various media originates from the anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the EM fields and is related to the difference between the number densities (nr and nℓ ) of right and left circularly polarized photons [25]. In fact, the second quantization of Eq. (67) yields (68) h n = ℏ c V ( n r – n ℓ ) , where V is an arbitrary volume. In general, the helicity of the optical fields is referred to as the “screw action” [26]. The substitutions of Eqs. (10),(12),(18) and (20) into Eq. (67) yield (69) h n = 1 2 { [ ( A 0 · ∂ C 0 ∂ t ) − ( C 0 · ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) ] + ( ∇ υ · ∇ φ 0 – ∇ u · ∇ ψ 0 ) } (70) = h e + h g , where he [=( A 0·∂ C 0/∂t –  C 0·∂ A 0/∂t)/2] is the effective helicity density and hg (=∇ υ·∇ φ 0 – ∇ u·∇ ψ 0) is the apparent helicity density associated with gauge functions (u and υ) and scalar potentials (φ 0 and ψ 0). All terms of ∇ φ 0· C 0, ∇ υ·∂ A 0/∂t, ∇ ψ 0· A 0 and ∇ u·∂ C 0/∂t which are generated in deriving Eq. (69) are dropped because of inner products between orthogonal vectors. When hg  = 0, of course, hn becomes gauge-invariant. The condition that hg of the second term on the right hand of Eq. (69) is eliminated is given by Eq. (35), which is quite the same as the condition of the gauge invariance obtained from s n arisen in an isotropic medium, as listed in Table 1. The same is also obtained by imposing the gauge invariance on s n of the optical fields in an isotropic medium (see Appendix A). Next, let us consider the time derivative of gauge-invariant hn (for hg  = 0) when the transverse plane EM waves are traveling along the z axis. It is investigated here whether hn can form the continuity equation in a homogeneous and isotropic medium without source of the screwness. The time-derivative of gauge-invariant hn is as follows (71) ∂ h n ∂ t = 1 2 ∂ ∂ t [ ( A 0 · ∂ C 0 ∂ t ) − ( C 0 · ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) ] . By substituting Eqs. (12) and (20) into Eq. (71), ∂hn /∂t is expressed as (72) ∂ h n ∂ t = 1 2 ( A 0 · ∂ 2 C 0 ∂ t 2 − C 0 · ∂ 2 A 0 ∂ t 2 ) = 1 2 ( A 0 · ∂ H ∂ t + C 0 · ∂ E ∂ t ) , where A 0·∂∇ ψ 0/∂t and C 0·∂∇ φ 0/∂t which are generated in deriving Eq. (72) are dropped because of inner products between orthogonal vectors. In a homogeneous isotropic medium, Eq. (72) is rewritten using Eqs. (1) ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nd (2) as (73) ∂ h n ∂ t = c 2 2 [ – ε 0 A 0 · ( ∇ × E ) + μ 0 C 0 · ( ∇ × H ) ] = − c 2 2 ∇ · [ ε 0 ( A 0 × ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) + μ 0 ( C 0 × ∂ C 0 ∂ t ) ] = – c 2 ∇ · s e . It indicates that when hn and s n are gauge-invariant in an isotropic medium, the continuity equation is established between them. It is represented simply as (74) ∂ h n ∂ t + ∇ · q n = 0 , where q n is the helicity flux (transfer of helicity per unit cross-sectional area per unit time) represented as q n  = c 2 s n [27,28]. In the familiar charge continuity equation, hn and s n correspond to the electric charge density ρn and the electric current density i e , respectively [16]. However, the continuity equation of helicity is basically not established in an anisotropic medium. 3.3.2 Torque equation It is shown here that the gradient of gauge-invariant hn is related closely with the Faraday rotation occurring in an anisotropic (optically active) medium [29]. When s n and hn are gauge-invariant, the time-derivative of s n is accompanied by ∇ hn , so that the sum of ∂ s n /∂t and ∇ hn produces a torque of [( E ×  D ) + ( H ×  B )] around the optical axis in an anisotropic medium, (75) ∂ s n ∂ t + ∇ h n = E × D + H × B . As a result, ∇ hn is linked with the time-derivative of s n through a torque in an anisotropic medium. The helicity density hn defined here is related closely with the Faraday rotation occurring in an anisotropic medium, as shown in Appendix B. 4 Conclusions In general, the observable physical quantity must be invariant under the gauge transformation. However, the old definitions of the SAM and OAM densities ( s o and l o ) and helicity density (ho ) for the optical fields were not gauge-invariant, despite they are observable. This is because these old definitions cannot be gauge-invariant in the presence of the sole vector potential A 0. However, the SAM, OAM and helicity densities s n , l n and hn defined here using two kinds of vector potentials ( A 0 and C 0) can be gauge-invariant by eliminating both apparent densities ( s g , l g and hg ) and the anisotropic spin density ( s a ) from themselves. The principal procedures of gauge invariance for s n , l n and hn are to make them independent of both gauge functions and scalar potentials and to quantize the phase difference (α) between A 0 and C 0. As a result, the conditions required to make s n , l n and hn gauge-invariant for the transverse plane EM waves vary depending on whether the medium is isotropic or anisotropic, as listed in Table 1. The gauge invariance of s n and l n depending on the phase difference (α) leads to the quantization of electromagnetic spin, so that it proves the legitimacy of quantum electrodynamics in a distinct way from the second quantization procedure. In any case, the present success for the quantization of α due to the gauge invariance assumes the coexistence of A 0 and C 0. As listed in Table 1, the conditions required to make s n and hn gauge-invariant in an isotropic medium are the same to each other, so that they form the continuity equation. The gradient of gauge-invariant hn is related closely with the torque generated in an anisotropic medium, so that it enables to give a reasonable explanation for the Faraday rotation caused in an anisotropic medium, unlike the helicity density defined in the dual electromagnetism. It was thus found that s n , l n and hn defined here for the optical fields can be described successfully by only two kinds of intrinsic vector potentials ( A 0 and C 0) without using gauge functions and scalar potentials. Appendix A The gauge invariance of helicity density hn It is shown here that the conditions for making s n and hn gauge-invariant are the same for transverse plane EM waves traveling along the z axis. To begin with, the condition required to make s n gauge-invariant in an isotropic medium is given by Eq. (35) as (A.1) ∇ u · ∇ ψ 0 = ∇ υ · ∇ φ 0 . Subsequently the components of ∇ u, ∇ υ, ∇ φ 0 and ∇ ψ 0 are derived as functions of vector potentials from Eqs. (10),-12,(18) and (20) as (A.2) ∇ u = A – A 0 , ∇ υ = C 0 – C , ∇ φ 0 = – E – ∂ A 0 ∂ t , ∇ ψ 0 = – H + ∂ C 0 ∂ t The substitution of Eq. (A.2) into Eq. (A.1) yields (A.3) ( A – A 0 ) · ( – H + ∂ C 0 ∂ t ) = ( C 0 – C ) · ( – E – ∂ A 0 ∂ t ) . Since two vectors of ( A  –  A 0) and ( C 0 –  C ) are pointing to the z axis and both ∂ A 0/∂t and ∂ C 0/∂t lie in the x-y plane, the following relation is obtained as (A.4) ( A – A 0 ) · ( ∂ C 0 ∂ t ) = − ( C 0 – C ) · ∂ A 0 ∂ t = 0 , due to the inner products between orthogonal vectors. As a result, the substitution of Eq. (A.4) into Eq. (A.3) yields (A.5) ( A 0 · H + C 0 · E ) = ( A · H + C · E ) . This manifests that the helicity density hn is just gauge-invariant. Therefore, the conditions necessary to make s n and hn gauge-invariant are found to be the same. Appendix B The relation between helicity densityhn and Faraday rotation θ F The torque equation for the spin density s n of transverse plane EM waves traveling along the z axis is accompanied by the gradient of gauge-invariant hn , as follows (B.1) ∂ s n ∂ t + ∇ h n = E × D + H × B , where (B.2) h n = 1 2 [ A · H + ( C · E ) ] . Two torque terms on the right hand of Eq. (B.1) represent the torque arising from the anisotropy in ε and μ of a medium. The second term on the left hand of Eq. (B.1) denotes the gradient operator ∇ hn with regard to z, which is caused by the anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the optical fields and is connected with the Faraday rotation angle. When the linearly polarized incident wave propagating along the z axis entered an optically active medium, it splits to the RCP and LCP waves in a medium [20]. After coming out from such a medium, these waves will be recombined to a linearly polarized light with the plane of polarization rotated by θ F from the plane of polarization of an incident polarized one. The Faraday rotation angle θ F is equal to one-half (θ/2) of the phase difference θ defined as θ = (kr  − kℓ ) L. This is referred to as the Faraday effect. The E and H components in the resultant LP waves consisting of two monochromatic plane waves traveling along the z axis in such a medium are expressed as (B.3) E = ( E 0 / 2 ) e − i ω t [ ( e i k r z + e i k ℓ z ) e 1 − ( e i k r z − e i k ℓ z ) e 2 ] and (B.4) H = ( H 0 / 2 ) e − i ω t [ ( e i k r z − e i k ℓ z ) e 1 + ( e i k r z + e i k ℓ z ) e 2 ] , where E 0 and H 0 are the amplitudes of electric and magnetic fields, ω is the angular frequency and kr and kℓ are the wave vectors represented by kr  = ω(εrμr )1/2 and kℓ  = ω(εℓ μℓ )1/2, respectively [20]. The vector potentials A and C are respectively obtained by setting scalar potentials to zero from the time integrations of Eqs. (B.3) and (B.4) as (B.5) A = ( − i E 0 / 2 ω ) e − i ω t [ ( e i k r z + e i k ℓ z ) e 1 − ( e i k r z − e i k ℓ z ) e 2 ] and (B.6) C = ( i H 0 / 2 ω ) e − i ω t [ ( e i k r z − e i k ℓ z ) e 1 + ( e i k r z + e i k ℓ z ) e 2 ] . Substituting Eqs.(B.3) and (B.4) into Eq. (B.1) through Eqs. (45) and (46), two torque terms on the right hand of Eq.(B.1) disappear using the complex conjugations. Substituting Eqs. (B.3)–(B.6) into Eq. (B.2), furthermore, hn is derived as a function of z using their complex conjugations as (B.7) h n = E 0 H 0 ω sin [ ( k ℓ − k r ) z ] , while it gets to zero for the RCP and LCP waves. When the light beam with radius a passes through an cylindrical medium with radius b (>a) and length L along the optical axis, therefore, the volume integration of Eq. (B.1) (after substituting Eq. (B.7) into Eq. (B.1) over the whole light beam is expressed as (B.8) ∂ S z ∂ t = – ∫ τ d υ ∇ z h n = π a 2 E 0 H 0 ω sin [ ( k r − k ℓ ) L ] e 3 , where S z  = ∫ τ s n dυ and τ is a volume of the light beam. The phase difference θ between the right and left circularly polarized waves is represented as (B.9) θ = ( k r − k ℓ ) L = 2 π L ( n r − n ℓ ) λ , where λ is the wavelength of the two monochromatic lights and nr and nℓ are the refractive indices expressed as c (εrμr )1/2 and c (εℓ μℓ )1/2, respectively," where c is the light speed.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.078,Energy transfer studies for the liquid and solid state materials of Rhodamine B and Styryl 7 Dye,"Abstract Samples of dye doped Rhodamine B and Styryl 7 with MMA in solid state and the dye mixture in liquid state were prepared. Frequencydoubled Nd-YAG laser was used to evaluate solid and liquid dye samples laser emission. Using dye cell and dye-coated prism setup, distributed feedback dye laser(DFDL) activity was initiated. The dependence of pulse widths, and output power on acceptor – donor concentrations and pump power were analyzed in theoretical form. The resulting output energy of DFDL for liquid and solid sampling were checked at high emission levels of donor and acceptor dyes for various pump powers and acceptor-donor concentrations and were compared with theroretical results. To identify the thermal stability of solid pattern, the differential thermal analysis(DTA) and Thermogravimetric analysis(TGA) were performed. By adjusting the prism arrangement, for liquid and solid samples continuous tunability was observed from 570 to 727nm.",Feb-18," Keywords Rhodamine B Styryl 7 Distributed feedback dye laser Methyl methacrylate 1 Introduction In physics, biology, photochemistry and radiation, the concept of transfer of energy has a vital aspect. The transmission of radiationless energy might take place in solid, liquid and gas states [1]. In order to increase the performance of dye lasers and spectral range, the energy trnasfer in laser dye mixture was examined [2–6]. The two main collaborating molecules in the process of energy transfer are the donor and the acceptor molecules. In the first phase the donor molecules absorb the electromagnetic radiations gets excited to higher energy state. At this point no energy radiations was traced around the acceptor molecules. Through radiators or the process of non radiative deactivity, the highly excited donor molecules restores to the ground state. Since the molecules of acceptor dye absorbs energy and hence become excited, is tracked by acceptor molecule along with photon emission. In this process of energy transmission, the lifetime of excited donor molecules and its light emissions gets decreased whereas there is an increase in the acceptor molecules emission of light [7,8]. The FRET is abbreviate in as Fluorescence energy transfer, which is otherwise called as the radiationless energy transfer The interaction happens between the donor and acceptor molecules through the excitation lifetime of donor before the radiance of photon. This state of radiationless energy transfer happens because any of the following reasons. a) diffusion-controlled collision and transfer occurs due to intermolecular distance, and it depends on the solvent viscosity and temperature. b) Resonance transfer due to long range dipole interactions. In other words, the distance between the acceptor and donor molecules are closer with a distance of 10–100Å [9–12]. There are many disadvantages of using liquid dye lasers that relevant for engaging huge amount of organic dye solutions that are relatively expensive and toxic in nature. By combining the molecules of dye into solid matrices, various experiements were performed to handle the dye solution issues. Various solid state host materials like porous glasses, modified organic silicates, polymers [4,7], glass of polycom and nano composites of silicates have been recommended. The host materials of solid state tend to have high efficicent nature and Photostability [13–22]. In comparision with similar host materials of solid state, polymeric matrices can help to produce active elements that can efficiently restrict the emission of radiation attributes [23]. Methyl Methacrylate has the best optical transparent nature and can highly resist the damage of laser and hence it is the most widely recommended polymeric material [24–26]. One of the widely used resonators is the distributed-feedback (DFB) type because these lasers are relatively easy to fabricate and they provide better laser performance. DFDL provides narrow band output, widely tunable, low amplification of spontaneous emission (ASE) of radiation,and eliminate the need for lossy dispersive elements. In this particular laser class, DFB lasers consisting of prisms or gratings, present extra advantages of grating which can be utilized to restrict the light output path. This helps to evaluate the emission wavelength represented as λDFDL =n λP/np sin θ. The refractive index of prism and dye are represented as n and np, λP represents pump laser wavelrngth. This equation permits estimation of emission wavelength at the time of fabrication of sample or during transient gratings or prisms in laser operation. The spectrum of tuning range is increased by the polymer fluorescent utilized or the gain of fluorophore spectrum which can be increased to 100nm. When a nano second or sub nanosecond pulse is pumped into the DFB structure (grating or prism), a shorter pulse of 20–100 times could be generated than the normal pump pulse. The reduction of pulse is caused by self Q switch that occurs in the gain medium due to spatial gain modulation of the feedback [27,28]. The present study consist of two phases,which includes the energy transfer of mixture of dye lasers in solid and liquid media, which are compared and implemented.The enery transfer between Rhodamine B and Styryl 7, DFB laser activity of are estimated both in solid and liquid states under the excitation of 532nm Nd- YAG laser which is a source of laser pump. The resultant output energy of DFDL is estimated during the peak radiation emission in acceptor and donor dyes with various acceptor and donor concentrations and different pump variations. Prism arrangement is utilized to analyze tuning range of wavelength. 2 Theoretical studies In solid polymeric matrix and solution form, the DFDL attributes were analyzed with donor as Rhodamine B and acceptor as Styryl 7 mixture in reference to rate equation [29]. The Runge − Kutta process was used to solve the rate equation. Rhodamine B and Styryl 7 spectral range parameters are estimated from the spectra of absorption and fluorescent data. Tables 1 and 2 show the estimated spectral parameters utilized in the rate equation model. From the observed spectral parameters it was found that in the solid matrix, R0 value is higher than the liquid dye mixture. Hence the energy transfer rate was found to be maximum for solid matrix [30] The results of simulation is estimated by substituting observed spectral parameters. The result of DFDL is analyzed for both donor and acceptor molecules at peak wavelengths. While the concentration of donor/pump power is increased, the DFDL’s single pulse resulting power is maximized, and the pulse width decreases. Simultaneously DFDL pulse comes out early as in comparision to the pulse of DFDL that radiated with low pump power and low donor concentration. This happens due to the accelerated increase in inversion of population to increment pump rate. The second pulse of DFDL is emitted over a specific concentration of donor/pump power. It has been noticed that over a greater concentration of donor/pump power, the emission of DFDL second pulse emerges. Yet, the DFDL radiation of donor wavelength depends on the acceptor concentration. When the acceptor concentration increases, the number of DFDL pulses decreases at the donor region. Also, the output power of the single pulse is found to decrease with increase in pulse width and the DFDL pulse is found to be delayed. But in the case of DFDL emission at acceptor wavelength build on the increase in the concentration of acceptor, and the pulse count of DFDL gets maximized with decrease in pulse width. The overall total energy for the series of pulses is obtained in calculation of distinct energy of pulse, through the datas obtained in simulation. The results of experiment correspond to the theoretical results. 3 Experimental studies 3.1 Materials MMA and laser grade type dyes of Rhodamine B and Styryl 7 were acquired at Sigma Aldrich and spectroscopicgrade of ethanol was utilized. Fig. 1 shows the general structures of MMA, Styryl 7 (C.I), RhodamineB (C.I)and the chemical formula. To pump DFDL, a repeated rate of 10Hz Nd-YAG laser(Spectra Physics, USA) with Q switch of 6ns pulse width is used. A spectrophotometer (PERKINELMER LS25) was used to measure the absorption of 0.01mm dye concentration along with spectrofluorometer (PERKIN ELMER LS45) was used to evaluate the emission range at the same dye concentration. 3.2 Spectrum of florescence and absorption Fig. 2 a and b shows the absorption and the emission of fluorescence spectrum with RB and S7 dyes in ethanol and the fluorescence spectrum of RB and S7 solid matrix. The fluorescence spectrum of RB overlap with the absorption of S7 spectrum, permitting the energy of electron to transmit from one dye to another. The overlap of spectrum shows the exisitance of radiative and nonradiative energy transmission. Fig. 2 indicate no additional fluorescent peak was present, which shows there is no complex arrangement of dye blend both in liquid and solid state. Hence any composite kind of energy transmission and collision kind of energy transmission were ignored both in liquid and solid state. 3.3 Preparation of dye-doped polymer Synthesis of polymer matrix with dye doped was performed using thermal bulk free radical polymerization method. The solvent used was ethanol. The monomer utilized was Methyl methacrylate. Polymer initialization was performed by Benzoyl peroxide. 10% of NaOH was used to wash MMA three times to remove any impurities. A ratio of 4:1 (v/v) for MMA and ethanol was used. A concentrate of 1mM Styryl 7 and a concentrate of 3mM Rhodamine B dye were mixed with the combination of 3gms per liter of initiator and MMA for polymeriastion. The mixed solution was placed inside a test tube and kept in a temperature controlled water bath in a nitrogen atmosphere. The water bath temperature was slowly increased till 80°C. Dye doped organic polymeric matrix gel was received and was used to coat over the prism and permitted to get dry. 3.4 Thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analysis Differential thermal analysis(DTA) and Thermogravimetric analysis(TGA) were conducted in order to find the dye doped polymer film’s temperature stability by the use of NETZSCH STA409C analyzer in a state of nitrogen when heated at 10°C/minute to a heating range of 800°C (Fig. 3 ) There were no loss of weight found in TGA curve till 335°C while dominant loss of weight begins at 400°C. The loss of weight denotes material point of decomposition. No loss of weight is noticed after 400°C. This shows that the material texture is maintained till 400 °C. DTA shows dominant endothermic peaks identified at 431.2°C show the crystallization in the phases of material decomposition. 3.5 Experimental set-up Fig. 4 (a) shows the experiment setting with a film of thin dye coating prism and frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser. A right angled isosceles quartz prism which is used to obtain a distributed feedback dye laser. Polymer matrices dye mixture was coated on one part of prism for example BC in solid condition as in Fig. 4(b) and in liquid condition dye mixture was filled in the dye cell of the BC of the prism as in Fig. 4(a). In order to target the emerging beam to the prism’s AB hypotenuse, the cylindrical quartz lens with a focal length of 5cm was used.The light coming out from the prism side AB is total internally reflected on the prism side AC,that reflected light interfere with the BC of the prism and forming fringes(Fig. 4(c)). Fig. 4(c) shows the light emerging from AB side of the prism, reflects internally to the AC prism side that intrude to the light reflection of prism BC side, that forms fringes. As a result,there is a variation of refractive index and gain in the medium. The output beam will be obtained by Bragg scattering reflection from the periodic structure implied all over the active medium.In this setup, the crosswisely excited pump of 0.02cm is provoked in the dye doped polymeric matrices coated prism and dyecell attached prism. While an incident pump laser light ray of wavelength λ p with an angle θ on the active medium, a DFDL may be obtained whose wavelength is given by [31]. λDFDL = nλp /np sin θ Here n and np are the refractive indices of the dye solution and prism material, respectively 3.6 Output measurements 3.6.1 Energy characteristics With the help of dual channel power meter(EPM 2000), the resulting energy radiation of liquid state and solid state dye samples for various input powers,concentrations of acceptor and donor were estimated. As shown in Figs. 5–10 . Wherever the concentration of donor/pump power is elevated, the output energies for donor and acceptor dye were found increased(Figs. 5–8). When there is an increase in acceptor concentration, the resulting energy of acceptor increases and there is a decrease in donor energy (Figs. 9 and 10). When the acceptor concentration increases, the energy transfer rate decreases because of donor quenching. During the donor quenching, internal quenching increases and donor energy decreases which leads to reduce the energy transfer rate constant [30]. Output energy for the solid matrix is high compared with the liquid solution. The reason for that is the concentration quenching in liquid solutions, originating from molecule collisions, is effectively reduced when organic molecules are embedded in a rigid matrix [32,33]. Experimental results were correlated with theoretical results. 3.6.2 Wavelength tuning In an individual experiment, sample of solid state was glazed over the prism and a dye sample of liquid state was obtained in the dye cell of a prism. A ratio of RB 3mM and S7 1mM was considered. The pump beam interference angle (θ) was adjusted. The emission peaks of both donor RB and acceptor S7 were calculated. Spectrometer (OSM2) was used to measure the wavelength output. The prism was tuned to the acceptor region by adjusting the angle of interference between 43° and 51° whose peak is obtained at 45° and for the donor region angle between 51° and 57° with its peak at 54° The angle of interference was adjusted inbetween 43° and 51° in order to tune the prism to acceptor region, and the peak was received at 45°, Whereas in the case of donor region angle was between 51° and 57°, with 54° as its peak. The wavelength tunability range was between 570 and 598nm and was continued till 698nm in the liquid state of acceptor DFDL, where as in the solid state it was angle extend of 41° for acceptor region.The donor DFDL tuning range was between 570 and 612nm and was continued till 727nm in the acceptor DFDL. From Figs. 11 and 12 compares the values of experiment to the theory value, it is clear that tuning angle of acceptor and donor is close to linear. 4 Conclusion The attributes of DFDL energy transfer in the solid and liquid dye mixture were analyzed. Solid-state dye samples based on MMA co-doped with RB and S7 dye mixture shows increase in lasing performance when compared with the liquid solution. This is due to concentration quenching in liquid solutions, originating from moleculear collisions, that is effectively reduced when organic molecules are embedded in a rigid matrix. The decomposition of solid polymeric matrix starts at 431.2°C while the themal stability is at 400°C. With the process of RB and S7 polymer matrix, resulting wavelength was increased from 698 to 727nm. This type of long range tunanble coherent lasers finds vital role in underwater communications and in biomedical applications. ", [1] S.A. Azim R. Ghazy M. Shaheen J. Photochem. Photobiol.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.059,Investigations on Ho-TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by precipitation method for optical applications,"Abstract The holmium doped titania nanoparticles are synthesized by precipitation method using titanium tetrachloride as a raw material. XRD for phase structure, DRS-UV absorption spectrum, FTIR presence of functional group, HRSEM with EDX morphological structure and presence of the elements in the synthesis material are assessed and the results evaluated. The study investigates the photocatalytic activity degradation of methylene blue dye under the visible light irradiation at different calcination temperatures enhancing the photocatalytic activity relatively with rise in temperature to 700°C parallelly records the inverse proportionality of photocatalytic activity with electron hole recombination through Photoluminescence spectra.",Feb-18," Keywords Titania Nanoparticles Phase transformation Photocatalytic activity 1 Introduction Titania are well known for their numerous application in technological areas such as: electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen [1], powerful photocatalyst [2,3], solar cells [4], air purification [5] and water sanitization [6]. Titania have three obviously occurring crystalline phases at various annealing temperature [7]. The tetragonal structures of anatase and rutile phase are generally considered for photocatalytic reactions. On comparing the phases, the anatase phase is reported to exhibit efficient photocatalytic activity [8]. The high impact of anatase and rutile phase in titania has attracted an extensive interest over the past decades. The photocatalytic activity of titania have some limitation like the fast recombination of electrons and holes [9] that depends on the crystalline phase of the synthesis materials [10]. Recent modifications in titania have been implemented to tune the characterization using several approaches. One of the approaches is doping, rare earth metal ions into the titania medium to enhance the concentration of organic pollutants on the surface of the material which increases the photocatalytic activity [11]. Among the rare earth elements, holmium trivalent ions when doped with inorganic element improved absorption properties and acts as an effective activator [12]. For example, rare earth elements doped with Fluorapatite: Yb3+/Ho3+ crystal get activated by Ho3+ ions at 980nm NIR light, as a result the crystal emits bright green and red light [13]. The holmium oxide has cubic crystalline structure, which exhibits Lewis acid sites and is well reactive in base sites (OH−). The interaction of OH− radicals at the holes results in the formation of surface hydroxyl radicals which enhances the photocatalytic activity of titania [14]. Hence, holmium ion modified the titania to give an efficient photocatalytic activity is chosen for study. Subject to various physical and chemical methods, viz., sol-gel [15], micro emulsion [16], electro-spinning [17], Magnetron sputtering [18], micro wave-hydrothermal [19], precipitation [20], the titanium dioxide is synthesized. Among these methods, the precipitation method is simple and cost efficient, gives fine crystalline structure. The present study, synthesis holmium doped titania implementing precipitation method at different annealing temperatures and relative crystalline phase, size, absorption, microstructure, luminescence properties to investigate the photocatalytic activity. 2 Experimental All substances of analytical grade are purchased from Loba and used without any further purification. Deionized water is used in experiments. The precipitation method is used to synthesise the holmium doped titania using ammonia solution as the precipitating agent. TiOCl2 solution is formed on adding 10ml of TiCl4 gradually to 100ml of cold deionized water. On stirring the turbid solution for 24h using a magnetic stirrer a clear solution is formed. The sulfuric acid is used to dissolve holmium oxide (Ho2O3) which is added to 20ml of the TiOCl2 to blend well. The blend is injected into 100ml of 7.3M ammonia solutions allowing it to form a precipitate on the surface. The precipitate filtered and rinsed with deionized water fed into the muffle furnace at 65°C for 24h. The amorphous titanium powder formed is ground using agate mortar. The prepared amorphous nanoparticles are annealed at 600°C and 700°C for 1h in an alumina crucible in muffle furnace. X-ray diffraction evaluates the phase transformation of the material. 3 Characterization The phase transformation of the holmium doped titania is recorded by Bruker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer with wide-angle range of 2θ from 10 to 60 using CuKα radiation. Shimadzu model 2600 is used to measure the absorption spectrum of the sample. The Spectroflurometer with 450W xenon lamps is the excitation source to characterize the photoluminescence properties. Bruker instrument is used to study the functional group of the material. The morphological structure and present element studied using FEI Qunta FEG 200 high resolution scanning electron microscopy. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Phase structure The X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) provides an exact idea of crystallinity and phase transformation of the synthesized material. The XRD pattern of holmium doped titania at different annealing temperature is shown in Fig. 1 . The holmium doped titania have tetragonal structure with lattice parameters of a=3.783Å, c=9.497Å having characteristic diffraction peaks are perfectly indexed to the (101), (112), (200), (105) and (211) planes. These peaks represent the anatase phase of titania at 600 and 700°C respectively (JCPDS No.082084 anatase). In undoped titania, the rutile phase take place between 500 and 700°C [7]. Above 600°C the transformation from anatase to rutile is prevented the substitution Ti4+ ions gets by Ho3+ ions this special feature qualifies itself to be taken for study. The anatase phase gets stabilized at 700°C because of the Ti-O rare earth bonding. This investigation explains the formation of TiOHo bond and its interaction with the synthesized material. The crystalline size (D) of the sample is calculated from the XRD data using Scherrer’s formula [21]. Based on the Scherrer’s formula, the crystalline size measured on the (101) plane of the anatase phases are 7.18nm and 8.06nm for two respective temperatures. The grain size of the sample exhibits expansion at higher annealing temperature. From the X-ray diffraction technique, it is confirmed that the holmium ions enhance the thermal stability of the anatase phase. 4.2 Absorption spectra The UV–vis-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UV) is used to determine the absorption spectrum of the material in the scan range of 200–1200nm (Fig. 2 ). The observed absorption spectrum of the material displays peaks near 391 and 418nm and these peaks in the spectrum shift towards the longer wavelength region giving better red shift absorption. The red shift reveals that the band gap energy of the material gets reduced due to intermediate energy level produced at higher calcination temperature. The band gap energy of the material can be determined using following equation [22], αhϑ = A(hϑ − Eo ) n Where α is absorption coefficient, h- Planck’s constant, ϑ- the frequency of light, A- the characteristic parameter for transition and Eo represents the energy related parameter and n transition parameter. Indirect transition parameter as n =½ and that, of direct transition n=2. Fig. 3 . Shows indirect band gap energy 3.1eV and 2.9eV at two temperatures respectively. It is revealed that the band gap energy of the holmium doped titania shift from 3.2eV to 2.9eV due to the annealing of temperature. 4.3 FTIR analysis Infrared spectroscopy determines the presence of functional groups of the nanoparticles during the precipitation process. The infrared absorption spectrum of the holmium doped titania annealed at different temperatures is plotted in Fig. 4 . The bands around 689–691cm−1 attribute to the vibration mode of TiOTi bond. The peak attributed around 805cm−1 confirms TiO vibration in anatase phase and the presence of metal oxygen bond γ(MO). The peak around the 1130cm−1 represents the vibration mode of Ti-OH. This peak reveals the presence of holmium metal ions in the synthesized material. The peaks ascertains 1619cm−1, 1635cm−1 for annealing temperature at 600°C and 700°C the ensures of oxygen belonging to groups i.e., CO, COO and CO. The bending vibration of OCO is around 2345–2349cm−1 and the stretching vibration of intermolecular hydrogen (OH) bond is assigned to the broad band around 2800–3600cm−1. 4.4 Photoluminescence spectra Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the luminescence properties of the material. The emission property of the material is related to its electron-hole pair recombination [23]. The Fig. 5 shows, the suppression of electron hole recombination at elevated annealing temperature. It is inferred that when the sample is annealed at 700°C the emission intensity of the spectrum decreases as the holmium ions trap the excited electrons which in turn reduces the electrons and holes recombination. The adsorbed O2 molecules by holmium ions produces OH radicals on the surface of the titania which facilitate the photocatalytic activity of the titania. 4.5 HRSEM with EDX The morphology of anatase holmium doped titania samples is investigated by High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (HRSEM). The spherical nanoparticles of the holmium doped titania calcined at 700°C is res in Fig. 6 (a–c). The aggregate spherical nanoparticles with different sizes have irregular voids dispersed among the particles. The Energy dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDX) pattern of holmium doped titania annealed at 700°C is shown in Fig. 6d, which indicates the presence of Titanium, Oxygen and Holmium in the synthesized material. 4.6 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activity depends upon the light absorption properties of the semiconductor material which in turn is related to band gap energy of the material. This energy must be equal to or greater than the photon energy in order to accelerate the photocatalytic activity of the synthesis material [24]. The titania nanoparticles exhibiting amorphous phase have lower photocatalytic activity than anatase [25]. So, the study undertakes the photocatalytic activity of anatase phase at annealing temperatures 600 and 700°C. 300W tungsten Xenon lamp is used as the visible light source for the degradation of the methylene blue as the model organic pollutant. Fig. 7 depicts the residual concentration ratio (C0/Ct) of methylene blue versus irradiation time under visible light irradiation. Where C0 represents the concentration of methylene blue and Ct is the concentration varying with respect to the irradiation time. From the result, it is observed that the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized material depends on the annealing temperature. While annealing temperature increases the photocatalytic activity and decreases the electron hole recombination. The rare earth doped with titania shifts the light absorption edge position to visible region increasing the calcination temperature. Therefore, 700°C calcined sample shows enhanced photocatalytic activity due to the suppression of the electron hole recombination, which facilitates the redox reaction for photodecomposition of pollutants. The efficient degradation is obtained due to the adsorption of the pollutants on the surface of the synthesized materials. Hence, the holmium plays an important role in sustaining the anatase phase, which supports the photocatalytic activity. Comparing the samples calcined at 600 and 700°C, the sample at 700°C shows enhanced photocatalytic activity than 600°C. 5 Conclusion The holmium doped titania nanoparticles are synthesized by precipitation method. The DRS-UV spectra analysis shows better red shift which indicates the reduced the band gap energy of the synthesis material at higher calcination temperature. The luminescence intensity of the holmium doped titania shows the suppression of the electron hole recombination at higher calcination temperature. The holmium doping with titania stabilizes the anatase phase of the host material and produced hydroxyl radicals to increase the photocatalytic activity. It is concluded that, holmium rare earth element and temperature play significant role in enhancing photocatalytic activity.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.066,Elimination of quenching defects by facile anion doping in CdSiO3 synthesized by green fuel assisted combustion method,"Abstract Despite being simple, and economical method, solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method’s applicability in preparation of silicate based phosphors is seriously limited. This is due to the fact that SCS method results in samples with quenching defects.We present a simple one pot synthesis technique for eliminating the defects in CdSiO3 by simple anion doping. We show that just by mere addition of SO4 2− anion, defects related to different kinds of oxygen vacanices disappear and PL spectra shows pure blue emission. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the SO4 2−doped CdSiO3 exhibits monoclinic phase and rod-like microstructure morphology respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) results reveal that the SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 shows a single emission at 406nm under the excitation wavelength of 259nm. Where as undoped CdSiO3 phosphor presented a series of emission peaks ranging from UV to green (349, 404, 423, 444, 472, 508 and 529nm) under the same excitation wavelength.",Feb-18," Keywords Solution combustion CdSiO3 Nanophosphor Photoluminescence 1 Introduction The phosphors are a type of energy storage materials, which can absorb ultraviolet/visible light and gradually release the energy at a certain wavelength [1]. Most of long-lasting phosphors are based on sulphide, aluminate, or silicate hosts. However, sulphide and aluminium based phosphors applicability is limited due to their thermal degradation at high temperatures [2]. Among the host lattices for luminescent material, silicate based compounds have been extensively investigated owing to their excellent stability towards acid, alkali, oxygen, their visible light transparency and relatively easy preparation methods [3–5]. In this context, CdSiO3 gained significant attention due to its one dimensional (1D) chain structure with edge-sharing SiO4 tetrahedron. With this kind of low dimensional structure it is easy to implant other ions into the host lattice to create traps at suitable depths, which can store excitation energy and emit light at room temperature [6]. During the past decade, a significant amount of work has been carried out to understand the emission properties of various rare earth ions and transition metal ions doped CdSiO3 [7–12]. Nevertheless, the doping of this material with anions has not been reported up to the moment. Therefore, studies of the luminescence behaviour of anion doped CdSiO3 can create new opportunities for researchers and for the applications of luminescence materials. In the present work, a new kind of CdSiO3:SO4 2− phosphor has been synthesized, where SO4 2− ion has been doped into the CdSiO3 lattice and its effect on PL behaviour is investigated. The prepared new material has been thoroughly investigated for its structural and optical properties. 2 Materials, methods, and characterization 2.1 Materials Cadmium nitrate, silicic acid and sulphuric acid were used as starting materials. The fresh Solanumlycopersicum extract (tomato) extract, which was prepared by squeezing Solanumlycopersicum fruit purchased from local market, Bangalore, India, and is used as a fuel. 2.2 Method In a typical synthesis of CdSiO3, stoichiometric quantities of cadmium nitrate, silicic acid and Solanum lycopersicum extract were taken in a beaker. The mixture was stirred for 15min and then placed on a hot plate till all the water evaporated. The resulting gel like residue was kept in the preheated furnace maintained at 500°C. Spontaneous smoldering type combustion takes place with the liberation of large volume of gases resulting in the formation of a brownish powder. The as-formed powder was subjected to heat treatment at various temperatures to obtain crystalline monoclinic CdSiO3. The same procedure was carried out for SO4 2− doping in CdSiO3 using 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4ml of sulphuric acid (H2SO4). 2.3 Characterization PXRD data were recorded using Philips Xpert PRO PAnalytical X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation source (λ=1.5418A°). The FTIR spectrum of the sample was recorded at room temperature using Fourier transform infrared Nicolet spectrometer in the range 400–4000cm−1. The microstrucure of the silicate powders was captured using JEOL-JSM–6490 LV SEM. UV–vis absorption spectra were measured with Perkin Elmer Model Lambda 750 spectrometer. PL spectra was examined by Perkins Elmer spectrometer using He–Cd laser with an excitation wavelength of 255nm. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a–d) shows the PXRD patterns of the as -prepared and calcined CdSiO3 products. The CdSiO3 powder obtained after combustion reaction at 500°C is amorphous as shown in Fig. 1a. The product obtained after calcination at 750°C/2h (Fig. 1b) indicates the formation of monoclinic phase besides some impurity peaks (marked by*). Further calcination of the as-formed product at 850°C and 950°C are respectively shown in Fig. 1(c and d) indicate the pure monoclinic CdSiO3 [JCPDS35-0810]. The absence of impurity peaks in the spectrum indicates that the natural fuel used in the present synthesis is not affecting the phase of the material. Intense and well defined X-ray diffraction peaks indicate a high degree of crystallinity. The crystallite size of the CdSiO3 obtained at 950°C is estimated using Debye-Scherrer formula and it is found to be ∼43nm. Fig. 2 (a–e) shows the PXRD pattern of the SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 products calcined at 950°C using different volume of H2SO4. –It clearly indicates that no significant changes observed as compared to monoclinic CdSiO3 (JCPDS 35-0810). The crystallite size of the SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 prepared at 950°C has been calculated using Debye-Scherrer formula and it is found to be ∼49nm. FTIR spectra have been recorded for undoped and SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 to confirm the presence of SO4 2− and other impurities present in the samples. Fig. 3 (a) and (b) shows the FTIR spectra of undoped and SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 respectively. The absorption bands corresponding to sulphate group are seen at 1191 and 617cm−1 in anion doped sample (Fig. 3b) [11]. However, these peaks are absent in FTIR spectrum of the undoped CdSiO3 (Fig. 3a). This result confirms the presence of SO4 2− in CdSiO3. Further, the asymmetric stretching vibrations of Si-O-Si bonds and stretching vibrations of terminal Si-O bonds are seen at ∼870 and 1227cm−1 respectively in both the samples. The bands at 485 and 555cm−1 are attributed to symmetric stretching vibrations of Si-O-Si bridges [12]. These FTIR results are in consistent with PXRD results confirming the foramtaion of CdSiO3 and SO42− doped CdSiO3. The UV–vis absorption spectra of different concentrations of SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 is measured in the range 200–700nm and it is shown in Fig. 4 A. A sharp peak is observed at ca. 235nm in UV absorption spectra of CdSiO3, this can be attributed to the absorption edge, (edge is the excitation from the top of the valence band(VB) to the bottom of the conduction band) [13]. Further, broad absoption bands observed between 250 and 480nm are due to various kinds of defects in the sample. These are typical of combustion derived samples due to various defects formed in carbon rich ambient synthesis [14,15]. It should be noted that when the volume of H2SO4 added was 1ml the nature of UV spectra changes. The broadness of the UV spectrum has considerably decresed and there is significant increase in absorbance intensity at a particular wavelength ca ∼300nm. This might be due to variation in the concentration and nature of defects at this particular anion concentration. The optical bandgap energy (Eg) is estimated using the Tauc relation as shown in (see Fig. 4B). It has been previously reported that the undoped CdSiO3 exhibits an optical energy band gap of 5.45eV [16]. Additionally, the Dy3+ (1–9 mol%) doped CdSiO3 exhibits a band gap of 5.49–5.65eV [16], which is higher than the undoped CdSiO3 band gap. It is interesting to note that the SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 samples exhibit a band gap in the range 4.90–4.78eV. This study indicates that the SO4 2−doped CdSiO3 shows lower band gap compared to the undoped CdSiO3. The result indicates that the SO4 2− modifies the defects which acts as intermediate energy levels within the band gap. Similar kind of results were also reported by Kouser et al. [17] where the substitution of anions like P and Cl into the lattice of CdS as well as in ZnS decreases the band gap. Fig. 5 a shows the typical surface morphology of the combustion derived CdSiO3 calcined at 950°C.The micrographs of undoped CdSiO3 powder is composed of particles with diameters in the range 8–10μm. The particles are nearly spherical shape and majority of them are also formed as semi-micro rods. These particles of varying size/shape are agglomerated and consist of voids. These morphological feautures are very typical of combustion derived products [18]. The SEM image of the SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 shows well ordered rod-like morphology and a few irregular particles (Fig. 5b). The length of the SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 rods are found to be in the range of 20μm. This rod like morphology observed in SO4 2− doped CdSiO3 is very unusual in products synthesized by combustion technique. In our previous reports we have shown that CdSiO3 prepared using oxylyldihydrizide as a fuel via solution combustion exhibits irregular particle aggregates, porous morphology with high degree of porosity [12]. The formation of nearly uniform rods is due to the fact that the tomato extract serves as a sacrificial biotemplate in the formation of CdSiO3 particles. Since, tomato extract consists of several multifunctional organic compounds such as carbohydrates, sugars, fibers, proteins and vitamins. The precursors distribute uniformly in tomato extract and form athree-dimensional polymeric network. The resulted polymeric network undergoes slow decomposition via smoldering type combustion, as observed for similar work by Maliyekkal et al. where, cellulose extract were used as templates for the preparation of MgO [19]. Photoluminescene emission spectra of CdSiO3 prepared without and with anion doping are shown in Fig. 6 (A) and (B) respectively. Upon 259nm excitation a series of emissions peaks ranging from UV to green are observed. The bands observed are centered at 349, 404, 423, 444, 472, 508 and 529nm. It is well known that neither Cd2+ nor Si4+ has its own characteristic emissions, therefore the series of luminous peaks seen are result of non-stoichiometry in prepared sample. This is typical of most of the combustion derived products, due to the fact that the products in SCS are formed in carbon rich environment (since carbon based compounds are used as fuels). The observed emissions in the region (347–472nm), may be attributed to (i) the radiative recombination of holes with an electron occupying the oxygen vacancy and (ii) recombination of a delocalized electron close to the conduction band with a single charged state of surface oxygen vacancy [20]. Further, the emissions in green region are (509 and 530nm), are due to the self-activated shallow luminescence centers of nanocrystalline CdSiO3 [21,22]. The emission spectra of anion doped CdSiO3 shows single broad band centred at 404nm. It is interesting to note that the defect related emission vanish with the addition of SO4 2− anion. The observed elimination of defect related emission is due to the substitution of SO4 2− for the anion vacancies. SO4 2− is substituted in place of defects (different kinds of oxygen vacancies) causing non-radiative transition and thereby reduces the non-radiative defect density. This is true because from PL spectra it is evident that with varying concentration of anion doping the nature of emission spectra changes. When the concentration of sulphate source is 0.25ml PL spectra shows broad emission with well defined shoulder at ∼340nm and a band centred at 404nm. With increase in SO4 2− concentration the sholder peak decreses in intensity and for 1ml of sulphate source a single well resolved emission centred at 404nm is observed. This result is consistent with our previous work [23], where PL spectra of CdSO4 exhibit a strong broad emission around 400nm. However, with further increase in sulphate source a shoulder peak appears at ∼420nm. To highlight these observation deconvolution of PL spectra was done for samples prepared with 0.25ml, 4ml of sulphate source and are presented in Fig. 7 (a), (b) respectively. This variation in PL spectra with varying SO4 2− concentration can be explained as follows. When the concentration of SO4 2− added was less (0.25ml) all the defects are not eliminated due to insufficient anion concentration. This results in shoulder peaks related to defect emission. On the other hand when the concentration of anion is beyond certain concentration (in this case 3ml) sholder peaks appear at different position (∼460nm). This is due to excess anion doping leads to the formation of new kinds of defects. This result is particularly interesting in phosphor designing, just by mere doping of optimized anion concentration the quenching defects can be eliminated. Elimination of quenching defects in rare earth doped phosphors will aid in enhanced PL emission with higher quantum efficiency. 4 Conclusions We have proposed a facile route for eliminating the quenching defects by simple aninon doping in CdSiO3. The doping of optimized concentration of SO4 2− into the lattice compensates for the various vacancies/defects and thus there is no emission due to defects. Photoluminescence studies on CdSiO3 doped with different SO4 2− ion concentration convincingly supports the proposed analysis.Photoluminescence results shows that undoped CdSiO3 shows number of defect related peaks ranging from blue to green. While the optimized anion doped CdSiO3 show single peak centered at 404nm. We believe that these findings would certainly facilitate in decreasing the quenching related to various defects in rare earth ion doped phosphors and help in design of efficient phosphors with better color purity.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.09.102,An adaptive RGB colour enhancement formulation for logarithmic image processing-based algorithms,"Abstract This paper presents an effective colour enhancement framework for statistical and logarithmic image processing (LIP)-based enhancement algorithms. The proposed approach utilizes the fusion of partial, multiple computed luminance channels with colour image channel statistics obtained from the input colour image for adaptive colour enhancement. The proposed scheme does not modify the image intensity channel, avoiding colour fading typically observed in colour images processed with conventional algorithms. The colour enhancement scheme compensates for the weaknesses of greyscale-based contrast enhancement and illumination normalization algorithms by focusing on preserving/restoring or enhancing colour. The proposed system avoids the conversion to complex, non-linear colour spaces such as HSI and HSV while producing similar results without manual adjustment of parameters. Additionally, an adaptive scheme for detection of images with unbalanced colour and uneven illumination is combined with the proposed system. Results show that the proposed scheme augments colour results of greyscale-based contrast enhancement algorithms and is relatively less complex compared to most algorithms in the literature.",Feb-18," Keywords Logarithmic image processing Illumination normalization Colour enhancement Adaptive colour correction Nonlinear colour space models Generalized un-sharp masking 1 Introduction The continued growth of high definition digital colour media and devices for their acquisition, transmission, processing and storage has precipitated the necessity for novel, effective and efficient colour image enhancement algorithms. These algorithms must utilize relatively low hardware resources to fit within the real-time digital hardware implementation constraints of embedded systems for such devices, which process great amounts of image and video data at high resolutions. Moreover, unwanted and unavoidable processes that manifest during the acquisition and transmission stages are still ever present in electronic devices. These include; blurring, noise, non-ideal illumination conditions, distortions, limitations of the dynamic range and display capabilities of electronic devices [1,2]. Several algorithms have been proposed to address these problems, however, the majority are suited to greyscale images. Greyscale, histogram-based algorithms perform poorly when processing images with uneven illumination [1–4]. Conversely, standard logarithmic image processing approaches also yield subpar results and at best produce faded images when processing faded or bright, low contrast images [4,3]. In addition, these algorithms developed for greyscale image enhancement do not work well for RGB colour images due to non-linearity and vector nature of the RGB colour channels that comprise the image [1,2]. Thus, processing individual RGB image channels usually leads to colour distortion or fading and numerous schemes have been devised in the literature to rectify this deficiency. These include colour restoration functions in the Multi Scale Retinex with Colour Restoration (MSRCR) [5], Ratio Rule-based neural network guided Homomorphic filtering (HF) [6,7] and luma-based approaches utilizing non-linear colour spaces such as the HSI and HSV colour spaces [8,3,9]. The effectiveness of the non-linear colour spaces lie in their ability to decouple the Intensity or Value channel from the Hue and Saturation channels, which are all components embedded within the individual Red, Green and Blue image signals [1,2]. Currently, most recent work on colour image enhancement has focused on the non-linear colour space alternatives, which are consistent and proven in their performance. These include combining HSI combined with Homomorphic filters [8] and HSV colour spaces with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) [10,11] and Genetic Algorithm or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques [12], Dynamic Stochastic Resonance (DSR)-based image enhancement [13,14] and Tone mapping algorithms [15–19], Generalized Unsharp Masking (GUM) [11] and Probability-based illumination normalization [20] algorithms. However, algorithms such as Generalized Histogram Equalization (GHE) and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) [2] yield worse results in HSI or HSV space, leading to the gamut problem described by Naik and Murthy in their work [21]. They also proposed a technique for avoiding gamut problem after enhancement without resorting to colour coordinate transforms. The recent work on fast hue and range preserving histogram specification (HS) functions by Nikolova and Steidl [22,23], utilize these foundations for their proposed improved algorithm. Additionally, the proposed LIP algorithm by Patrascu and Buzuloiu [24], is also hue preserving, though its adaptive nature requires the solution of a set of relatively complex equations to obtain particular image parameters for enhancement. Alternative colour enhancement and preserving techniques include tensor-based methods using a Quaternion Discrete Fourier Transform [25], histogram modification equalization-based methods in 1D [26] and 3D spaces [27], development of a colour LIP colour correction framework [28] and multi-exposure homomorphic filtering [17]. Recently, works utilizing alternative LIP models [29] combining the Generalized Un-sharp Masking (GUM) [11,29] and probabilistic models for simultaneous illumination and reflectance estimation have been reported [20]. All the aforementioned alternatives still require colour conversion to HSV/HSI colour space to avoid/minimize the distortion or colour fading resulting from illumination correction operations in RGB space. This also adds increased hardware resource usage in digital hardware system implementations [3,30]. Furthermore, even when some of the algorithms are implemented in the HSI and HSV colour space, there is usually not much colour improvement in addition to faded colours observed after processing. Furthermore, any unregulated modification of the hue and saturation affects the final colour aesthetics of the colour image when converted back to RGB space. Thus, it is vital that the proposed system avoids the distortion of colours. The primary motivation of the proposed algorithm in this work was to address the issues of colour distortion, automation and consistency of results in implementation. This is because most of the conventional approaches yield inconsistent colour results, are highly complex and not usually adaptive or automated, requiring manual adjustments of several parameters and selection of various functions. Even with canonical values, some of the earlier schemes do not yield best results for all images, lacking generality in application. In contrast, the proposed system yields consistent results as expected due to its theoretical foundations supported by extensive experimentation. The rest of the paper is outlined as follows; the second section highlights the key contributions, features and objectives of the proposed scheme. The third section discusses relevant related works in detail and their limitations. The fourth section discusses the details of the proposed colour enhancement function and the justification for its implementation with presentation of theoretical formulation. The fifth section presents experimental results of the proposed scheme and its colour augmentation ability in addition to comparisons with other algorithms from the literature. Additional presentations include the modification of a previously computational complex algorithm by replacing a non-linear colour space converter with the proposed colour enhancement algorithm. Additional replacement of the edge preserving component of the contrast enhancement algorithm with a less complex but more effective alternative, reduced the run-time and complexity of the algorithm. The sixth section presents a brief discussion and possible applications and hardware realization possibilities of the proposed system. The final section presents the conclusions and a comprehensive summary of the work. 2 Key contributions, features and objectives The key and novel contributions of this work include: • Adaptive, combined fusion of intensity and value components to enhance colour rendition of processed colour images using weighted combination computed from colour channel statistics. • Colour restoration of processed colour images with distorted or degraded colours using computed modal ratios from all three colour channels. • Use of probability mass function (PMF) to compute standard deviation from mode (SDFM) and mean of modal ratio (MOM) parameters as inputs in the implemented system, ensuring adaptive and automated colour enhancement/restoration. • Additional scheme for detecting dark images or images with dominant colour cast based on statistical contrast measure and entropy values used as inputs to a classifier for decision-based colour enhancement processing. The key objectives and features include: • The design and realization of a generalized and practical colour enhancement algorithm that can be a companion function to almost any grayscale-based image enhancement algorithm, improving its colour enhancement performance. • Improving colour enhancement and colourfulness by regulated dilation without upsetting colour balance. • Algorithm yields improved colour images, matching and/or surpassing results of HSI and HSV-based approaches while avoiding their complex and extensive colour coordinate forward and reverse transformation functions. • The developed algorithm is fast, feasible and practical for hardware implementation due to its point-wise nature of operation. • The proposed algorithm can also be modified to mimic results of any colour space conversion technique without performing the actual full colour space conversion. 3 Prior related works The illumination correction algorithms treated in this paper are limited to the LIP and SLIP models with some discussions about the log-ratio (LR) based models. However as noted, these algorithms generally have a number of limitations, which include; minimal edge and contrast enhancement, inability to perform consistent colour correction, loss of details in bright image regions and inability to enhance faded, low contrast images. The colour fading and distortion aspect is addressed in this work and solutions to the colour fading problem from the literature are included for comparison. Furthermore, the drawbacks of these approaches are also briefly discussed with added references for further details. 3.1 Logarithmic image processing (LIP) and symmetric LIP (SLIP) models The illumination correction term discussed here is based on a variant of the log-ratio (LR), log image processing (LIP) [11] and symmetric LIP (SLIP) model [29]. The Retinex-based algorithms are derived from the LR method while the Homomorphic filter is a variation of the model. The LR and the LIP values are defined in the range: (0, L-1), where L is the number of defined grey levels. The operations for the LIP model [11,29] are; (1) ψ ( a ) = − R ln ( 1 − a R ) ; a ⊕ b = a + b − a b R ; λ ⊗ a = R − R ( 1 − I i ( x , y ) R ) λ (2) ⊖ b = − 1 ⊗ b = − R ( b R − b ) ; a ⊖ b = a ⊕ ( ⊖ b ) = R ( a − b R − b ) In (1) and (2), ⊕, ⊖ and ⊗ are vector addition, vector subtraction and scalar multiplication operations in the LIP domain, respectively. The terms a and b are vectors while λ is a scalar value. R is the range of the image vector, defined in the domain, (0, R) and ψ ( a ) is a LIP-based transformation function for vector a. Conversely, the operations for the SLIP model [29] are; (3) ψ ( a ) = − R * s g n ( a ) ln ( 1 − | a | R ) ; a ⊞ b = R * s g n ( a + b ) [ 1 − ( 1 − | a | R ) γ 1 ( 1 − | b | R ) γ 2 ] Where in (3), the exponents, γ 1 = s g n ( a ) s g n ( a + b ) and γ 2 = s g n ( b ) s g n ( a + b ) . Also; (4) λ ⊠ a = R * s g n ( λ a ) [ 1 − ( 1 − | a | R ) | λ | ] ; ⊟ b = − 1 ⊠ b = R * s g n ( − b ) [ 1 − ( 1 − | b | R ) | − 1 | ] (5) a ⊟ b = a ⊞ ( ⊟ b ) = R * s g n ( a + ( ⊟ b ) ) [ 1 − ( 1 − | a | R ) γ 1 ( 1 − | ( ⊟ b ) | R ) γ 2 ] (6) ψ − 1 ( a ) = R * s g n ( a ) ( 1 − e − | a | R ) In (3)–(6), ⊞, ⊟ and ⊠ are vector addition, vector subtraction and scalar multiplication operations in the SLIP domain [29], respectively. The signum function, sgn is defined as; s g n ( x ) = { − 1 , x < 0 0 , x = 0 1 , x > 0 . The terms a and b are vectors while λ is a scalar value. R is the range of the vector, defined in the domain, (0, R) and ψ ( a ) is a SLIP-based forward transformation function for vector a while ψ − 1 ( a ) is a SLIP-based inverse transformation function for vector a. 3.2 Generalized Un-sharp Masking (GUM) algorithm The GUM algorithm proposed by Deng [11] is composed of three essential components namely an Edge Preserving Filter (EPF), Contrast Enhancement (CE) function and the Adaptive Gain Control function (AGC). The algorithm utilized for the EPF is the Adaptive Median Filter (AMF) [31] and the selected CEF was the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) [10] algorithm. The LIP- and SLIP-GUM algorithms are defined by the expressions; v L I P = z ⊕ [ γ ⊗ ( x ⊖ y ) ] and v S L I P = z ⊞ [ γ ⊠ ( x ⊟ y ) ] where x, y, z and γ are the input image, EPF output, CEF output and AGC output respectively. Based on the work from the current literature, the LIP-GUM [11] and the SLIP-GUM [29] algorithms show some promising results. However, this is to be expected due to the fact that these algorithms are a combination of several algorithms such EPF, CE and AGC components. The outputs of these components are evaluated in the LIP and SLIP domains respectively. However, as pointed out in [20], the traditional log-based approaches lead to detail loss in the extracted reflectance component. Additionally, the traditional LIP GUM leads to out of range errors for some images and have to be corrected with the SLIP approach [29]. Furthermore, there is still loss of detail in the GUM outputs in addition to little colour improvement despite the fact that the operations are performed usually on the intensity component of the HSI or HSV transformed image. This is in addition to the AMF and CLAHE, which are highly computationally complex as well. Thus the exploration of comparable, less complex algorithms to replace the AMF in the GUM forms part of the improvements of the work. Consequently, we utilize relatively less complex but highly effective algorithms for the EPF component of the GUM. 3.3 Colour enhancement approaches The key, relevant, related works on colour enhancement include the Colour restoration routine [5], ratio rule [6,7], non-linear colour spaces [2], discrete cosine transform (DCT)-based method [32] and hue preserving algorithms [21,23]. Each scheme has its own unique features resulting in advantages and disadvantages. 3.3.1 Colour restoration function (MSRCR) The colour restoration function for the popular MSRCR [5] is given as; (7) C i ( x , y ) = β log 10 [ α I i ( x , y ) ∑ i = 1 s I i ( x , y ) ] (8) I M S R C R i ( x , y ) = G [ C i ( x , y ) . I M S R i ( x , y ) + b ] (9) I M S R i ( x , y ) = ∑ s = 1 S w s [ log 10 ( I i ( x , y ) ) − log 10 ( I i ( x , y ) * h s ( x , y ) ) ] (10) h s ( x , y ) = K e − x 2 + y 2 c s 2 In Eqs. (7)–(10), i = 1,...N where N is the number of bands or channels in the input image, s = 1,..S, where S is the number of scales, w s is the weight of the scale, I i ( x , y ) is the ith band of the input RGB colour image, h s ( x , y ) is the Gaussian surround function or spatial filter kernel, I M S R i ( x , y ) is the ith band of the output image of the MSR algorithm while I M S R C R i ( x , y ) is the ith band of the final output image of the MSRCR algorithm after applying the colour restoration function. Lastly, α, β, G and b are constants which are termed canonical gain-offset parameters to obtain the best results for the MSRCR [5] which is highly computationally complex. The colour restoration function in (7) utilizes decoupled, normalized R, G and B channels of the original image (the value being converted to the logarithm domain) to reduce effects of inter-channel dependency [5]. 3.3.2 Ratio rule The ratio rule was developed by Seow, et al. [7,6] and is a state-space associative memory-based neural network. The network employs a line-of-attraction-based representation to describe the RGB inter-channel colour relationships within the image [6,7]. After training the network with the initial colour arrangement prior to processing, the system recalls the initial colour structure of the processed image by iteration [6,7]. This information is used to recalibrate the colours of the processed faded RGB colour image, effectively performing restoration. The homomorphic filter [1,2] was the image enhancement algorithm used for the processing of the RGB colour image, leading to the faded result that required restoration. The Ratio Rule scheme is evidently computationally complex [33], and it is not clear what the implications would be if the size of the images increases considerably in addition to increase in iterative operations. Furthermore, the algorithm and its results were not extensively compared to existing colour enhancement alternatives. A similar colour retrieval and enhancement scheme is proposed by Iqbal, et al. for surveillance images [34]. 3.3.3 Non-linear colour spaces Luma-based approaches have become the norm in colour enhancement-based image processing, due to the established colour coordinate transforms and successes in colour segmentation applications utilizing non-linear colour spaces. Studies carried out using this solution have shown that the system is feasible and hardware architectures utilizing the schemes have been reported in the literature [8,9]. These include the HSI and HSV colour spaces and in the latter, the hue is defined as the rotation angle between the Red plane and the origin [1–3]. The saturation is the distance from any point in the colour space system to the colour surface [1–3], while the value (V) represents the intensity (or luminosity) channel attributes of the image. The equations for the RGB to HSV transformation [1,2] are given as; (11) V = max ( R , G , B ) ; S = V − min ( R , G , B ) (12) H = { G − B S ; R = V 2 + B − R S ; G = V 4 + R − G S ; B = V } The HSI colour space was based on the human visual system and colour perception and is modelled with a colour hexagon, triangle or circle representation [1,2]. The hue, saturation and intensity attributes are similar in definition to that of the HSV system; however, their mathematical expressions are different. The primary and secondary colours of light are vertices in the hexagon model and line segments in the colour triangle model [1–3]. The primary and secondary colours are separated by a value of 120° in the colour circle representation [1–3]. The equations for the RGB to HSI conversion [1,2] are given as; (13) I = R + G + B 3 ; S = 1 − min ( R , G , B ) I (14) H = { θ ; i f B ≤ G 360 ° − θ B > G } ; θ = c o s − 1 ( ( R − G ) + ( R − B ) 2 ( ( R − G ) 2 + ( R − B ) ( G − B ) ) ) The HSI colour conversion yields superior results compared to the HSV colour space [30,3,8]. Large LUTs are normally used for the hue computation in HSI space, though this becomes impractical for images with larger bit depths greater than eight bits per pixel (bpp) on digital hardware systems with limited memory. There are numerous alternative equations for calculating the hue component [3,30], which is the most crucial aspect. The search for alternatives is partly due to the challenges encountered in accurately computing the hue channel in digital hardware devices such as FPGAs using fixed point [3,30]. However, a hardware architecture solution utilizing a proven alternative formula, resulting in the full HSI converter FPGA hardware architecture has been reported in recent literature [3,30]. To date, this is still the only publicly known or available implementation. Based on work in the literature, the HSV variant is the most common digital hardware implementation of nonlinear colour space converters [9,3,35,18]. This is due to its relative ease of implementation compared to the HSI colour space conversion in fixed-point digital hardware [30]. Since the Hue is the most important aspect of the human visual system, on which the HSI and HSV colour spaces are based, any distortions in computation would affect the final result, even without further processing [3,30]. In the HSV case, hue computation is much more straightforward, using multiplexer and basic rational operations. However, utilizing the non-linear colour space converters result in a speed performance bottleneck in hardware if only the intensity channel is processed (though this is an advantage in terms of reduced computational load and complexity, if the image processing algorithm itself is relatively highly involved). This is because latency increases since the Hue and Saturation channels must be synchronized with appropriate delays to ensure that they are correctly combined with the corresponding processed intensity channel for accurate conversion to RGB space after processing. This thwarts parallelization efforts due to the dependency of all three channels on each other for the reverse conversion. Even pipelining techniques reach a peak performance ceiling beyond which there is no further improvement in speed of the design. Latency is increased further along with throughput as a result but this delay adds to the speed of the reverse conversion. Thus, no matter how fast the image processing algorithm or the colour space conversions are, they all depend on the amount of delay required to ensure accurate synchronization and conversion to RGB space. 3.3.4 DCT-based colour enhancement This scheme was proposed by Mukherjee and Mitra for colour enhancement in DCT domain [32]. The approach converts the RGB image to the YCbCr or YUV colour space and computes the DCT of each component [32]. Three main processes are then performed on these transformed components, namely; local background illumination adjustment, local contrast preservation and colour preservation [32]. In spite of its apparent simplicity, there is DCT computation, block splitting and merging steps and several parameters to consider in addition to a blocking artefact removal (BAR) algorithm [32]. Also, the number of parameters to tune increases, depending on the function chosen for illumination adjustment. Thus, the algorithm is not automated, requires user specified parameters, a selected function and option of using BAR algorithm if blocky effects appear in the processed images. 3.3.5 Hue and range preserving colour enhancement Initially, the work by Naik and Murphy proposed a colour image enhancement algorithm that avoided the gamut problem [21]. Recently, Nikolova and Steidl proposed a fast hue and range preserving histogram specification algorithm to mitigate the gamut problem that occurs after RGB colour image enhancement [23]. Rather than processing each individual channel, they convert the image to the HSI colour space and map the intensity channel to an ideally chosen histogram using strict ordering algorithm developed by [36]. However, the algorithm is not automated and performs best with user specified parameters and and may yield inconsistent results. 4 Proposed colour enhancement approach Based on analysis of related works, there is need for a scheme that combines the effectiveness and advantages of the HSI and HSV colour space while avoiding their weaknesses. Such a scheme should be able to handle most images presented and yield good colour enhancement/rendition regardless of the damaging effects of the prior applied image contrast enhancement algorithm. This is in addition to avoidance of distortion or degradation of the image pixel intensity values in the process of colour rendition. The requirements of this system include; • Perform on par or (if possible) better than the HSI and HSV colour converters • Inherit their strengths (decoupling intensity, thus becoming contrast agnostic) and eliminating their weaknesses. • Should not distort colour balance of the R, G and B channels. • Suitable, practical and amenable to hardware implementation. • Should be adaptive and avoid manual parameter adjustments. • Should be generic and work with most algorithms it is combined with. The general form of the proposed algorithm consists of a contrast enhancement transfer function, T ( f ( x , y ) ) and colour enhancement function, C ( f ( x , y ) ) of an input RGB colour image f ( x , y ) = { I i ( x , y ) ; i = 1 t o N } with the number of channels, N =3 expressed in the following form for each channel; (15) I i f i n a l ( x , y ) = C ( I i ( x , y ) ) . T ( I i ( x , y ) ) Assume the RGB colour cube as a container, within which all possible colour image configurations will fit. Thus, we show a colour plot of the relationship between the R, G and B channels in a colour image. If we consider the image pixels as particles, and that the cohesion of these particles taken as a function of their distances apart from their mean, then we can measure the correlation of the pixels to each other. Ideally, highly correlated particles are closer (greater cohesion) while those that are further apart have less correlation (lower cohesion) with each other. However, since the distribution of image colour pixels do not follow a normal distribution and will have highly skewed mean vales, the usage of the mode in the probability mass function (PMF) gives a better estimate. Thus, we initially assume that the colourfulness or colour aesthetics that is visualized by the human visual system and interpreted by the brain could be perceived as a measure of the cohesion or correlation of these particles defined by their closeness to their modal ratio values. If the R, G and B particles are slightly apart, the colour balance is slightly modified. However, if the distance increases between the particles and the centre of the probability mass distribution, the colour fades or distorts and colour balance is lost (destabilization). This balance is the inherent colour relationship between the R, G and B channels of colour images. We proceed to test these assumptions with actual experiments to verify, modify, discard or re-evaluate them. The figures shown in Fig. 1 illustrate this idea of a colourful (Notre Dame) [5] image and its distortion in relation to its RGB colour plot. In Fig. 1(b), the image is highly distorted since the R, G, B particles are scattered and some are almost at the edge of the cube. This distortion can arise from a grey-scale algorithm with extremely high gain incorrectly applied to a RGB colour image. Furthermore, the degradation is drastic in the high frequency regions or areas with more “energetic” pixels. Note that the smooth, slowly varying regions (blue sky) are relatively unaffected by the distortion. The proposed system re-establishes correlation between the various colour channels by forcing these scattered particles closer or re-arranging the structure of the particles without upsetting the colour balance. This reduces the distance between particles, indicating a visual plot of colourfulness. The proposed method enhances colour images, avoids saturation of bright/dark regions of images, thus suitable for both contrast enhancement and illumination normalization/correction algorithms. We will show that considerable improvements are obtained with the proposed colour enhancement scheme. 4.1 Colour channel dominancy and distortion prediction Initial experiments were performed to determine any discernible consistent pattern between the R, G and B channels using normalized decoupled versions of the channels based on formulations from the literature. The sample results for the initial experiment are as shown in Fig. 2 (a) with the histogram of the inverse normalized RGB channels or intensity ratios of the girl image [37] processed with the intensity ratio controlled HF. Observing the modal ratios show that the Red channel has a less common occurring value. Any attempt at using the actual modal ratio values for the red component in this case will yield erratic results as shown in Fig. 2(b) as the most occurring pixel ratio is not up to a third of the RGB colour image. Thus, when using the adaptive the red channel is overcompensated, leading to oversaturation, causing the observed colour bleeding effect in Fig. 2(b). The red flower in the image is completely indistinguishable from the red scarf in Fig. 2(c) and other red regions are also overcompensated. Sample results in Table 1 show the modal ratios of the normalized colour channels of several tested images and indicate that most of the pixel values are close to the assumed model of intensity, with a factor of 3. The pie charts generated in Fig. 3 shows the modal ratio profile (i.e. most common ratio) values obtained for the decoupled, normalized R, G and B channels of the Girl image. The values generated in the plots indicate the percentage of values that match the modal ratio of each channel. Rounding up of values as shown on the left hand side of Table 1 will increase the respective percentages for each of the channels in the modal profiles, which would lead to colour distortions after processing. Based on quick observation, 3 is the most commonly encountered ratio value, validating the naive intensity model from the HSI by experimentation. The pie chart representation was chosen since it provides quick visual cues regarding the balancing of R, G and B channels of a colour image, which may not be easily observed using conventional visual representations such as histograms and image diagrams. The dominance of a channel can be easily deduced due to the pie chart plots of the modal ratio values in each channel (Fig. 4 ). The reason for the distortion of colours in the background component of the image in Fig. 2(c) is due to the naïve adaptive scheme applying the computed modal ratio of each channel as a factor. This favours the less dominant channels (in this case, R and B) and will result in some colour regions of the image being over enhanced (where modal ratio values are less than or equal to 3) and punishes the more dominant channels (in this case, G) while other colour regions are slightly or moderately enhanced (where ratio values are greater than 3). This is confirmed by the saturated blue background and red hue of the face and scarf foreground and the RGB image modal ratio profile in Fig. 3. Thus, the modal ratio profile is a reliable indicator of the results of the blind, adaptive scheme, which are clearly undesirable. This observation may possibly explain the gamut problem for certain images after processing in a different colour space and reverse-mapped to RGB. 4.2 RGB colour enhancement Initially, the system was developed using the intensity component computation of the HSI colour space as a starting point since it provides the best colour rendition when combined with enhancement algorithms [30]. Additionally, the proposed system is less computationally complex than the colour restoration function and the ratio rule method (which is iterative). Based on approximations of the experimental results, we define the enhanced output colour image as; (16) I i f i n a l ( x , y ) = [ I i ( x , y ) I ] . I i ' ( x , y ) ; I = ∑ i = 1 N w i I i Where i =1…, N; N being the number of channels (N =3 for RGB image) and the intensity channel, I while w i is the weighting factor of the ith channel such that ∑ i = 1 N w i = 1 . The weights do not have to be equal but their sum must be unity. For the HSI colour space, the intensity is calculated and setting R = I 1, G = I 2, and B = I 3 and recognising that w 1 = w 2 = w 3 = 1 3 , the well-known form is as shown in (17) (17) I = I 1 + I 2 + I 3 3 = R + G + B 3 Thus, based on extensive experimentation, a large majority of colour images are properly enhanced using the scheme, while a few outlier images need some modification by using unequal weights for the improved colour output. The well balanced images will yield ratios of 3 for each channel, but other images will yield ratios greater than or less than 3 for either the R, G or B channels. Investigation of the degree of dispersion of pixel ratios from the modal value necessitated a measure to evaluate the standard deviation from mode (SDFM) and is defined as; (18) S D F M = ρ = ∑ i = 0 N ( I i − m ) 2 N Where m is the modal value obtained from I i , the image intensity ratio (or inverse normalized image) distribution of the ith channel of the colour image. The values obtained from the R, G and B channels of the girl image are 0.6711, 13.9831 and 6.7491 respectively. The figures imply that the R channel has the lowest variance from the modal value. However, this does not give a clear explanation, thus the usefulness of the modal profile, which indicates that the R channel intensity ratios are quite low. Evaluation of the maximum value in the R channel yields a value of 9 and a minimum value of 1.0233. For the G channel, maximum value is 168 and minimum value is 1.2857. For the B channel, maximum value is 225 and minimum value is 1.6667. Thus, the modal values actually give the maximum value of the probability mass function, which cannot be deduced from the maximum and minimum pixel intensity values across colour channels. The standard formula for computing a greyscale image from RGB space based on the luminous efficacy curve [1] is given as; (19) I = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B In (19), w 1 =0.299, w 2 =0.587, w 3 =0.114 and in all cases w 1 + w 2 + w 3 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. This scheme leads to colour bleeding for images and high saturation in the overcompensated channel when using mainly the HSI intensity model. The HSI result has too much colour and using the colourfulness parameter by Susstrunk and Hasler [40], the output colourfulness is 174.6909 (which is quite high) and relative colour enhancement is 3.9549. It is clear from the image that the colourfulness measure alone cannot not provide any information about colour aesthetics of balance as earlier assumed. Due to this oversaturation of the red channel using the HSI colour space, the Value channel from the HSV model was also tested and is given as; (20) V = max ( R , G , B ) The results are shown in Fig. 5 with colourfulness value of 78.8977 and relative colour enhancement value of 1.7862. Though the HSV provides a better balance, there is still dominance of Red channel in regions of the image. Thus a combination of values was devised to yield an image with more balanced colour output since the value channel would reduce the oversaturation effect of the intensity channel. We obtain the intensity-value (IV) result by combining the intensity and value components in the general form; (21) I V = α I + β V In (21), α and β are constants <1 such that α+ β =1. By setting α= β =0.5, we obtain the IV component as an equally weighted average of the two components as I V = I + V 2 . However, more experiments may lead to cases where α< β for image with balanced colour output. The result of the combination with the HF is shown in Fig. 6 . Comparing the image processed with HSI-HF and the RGB IV-HF shows the improvements of the model and its similarities with the HSI colour space model results in RGB space. Note that the red flower and scarf features are much more discernible in the IV-model than in the HSI results. Thus, combining both value and intensity schemes yields a hybrid model, which is better than either of the two, with more balanced saturation by combining the strengths of each colour space model without inheriting their weaknesses. It should be noted that the weighted average is one method of combining the channels and alternative methods include evaluating maximum of the intensity (I) and value (V) channels. However, by deduction and experiment, the latter results resembled the HSV results using maximum while a minimum yielded the HSI results. Other relationships such as multiplicative-square root relationship yielded good but inconsistent results. Thus, the weighted average model still provided the best and most consistent results. Based on experiments, the probability mass function (PMF) of intensity ratios obtains a maximum value around 3, which is the modal ratio value. With the results obtained, the complete colour enhancement routine can be redefined using the IV model in the general form, with the constants α and β as; (22) I i f i n a l ( x , y ) = [ I i ( x , y ) I V ] . I i ' ( x , y ) = [ I i ( x , y ) α I + β V ] . I i ' ( x , y ) Further expansion of the formula leads to the following left-hand-side (LHS) expression in (23), using the intensity and value channel calculations. If the RGB to intensity image conversion is to be employed with varying weights, the general form is shown in the right-hand-side (RHS) expression of (23); (23) I i f i n a l ( x , y ) = [ I i ( x , y ) α ( R + G + B 3 ) + β ( max ( R , G , B ) ) ] . I i ' ( x , y ) = [ I i ( x , y ) α ( ∑ i = 1 N w i I i ( x , y ) ) + β ( max ( R , G , B ) ) ] . I i ' ( x , y ) 4.3 Colour saturation moderation and control As was earlier noted, the colours of some enhanced images are oversaturated. Consequently, we utilize the modal ratio to control the level of colour enhancement by utilizing the reciprocal as an exponent for the colour enhancement formula. In other words, control of the saturation is obtained by modifying Eq. (23) as; (24) I i f i n a l ( x , y ) = [ I i ( x , y ) α ( ∑ i = 1 N w i I i ( x , y ) ) + β ( max ( R , G , B ) ) ] 1 m . I i ' ( x , y ) For emulation of results from any other linear colour spaces (which are hue preserving as noted by Naim and Murthy), the expression becomes; (25) I i f i n a l ( x , y ) = [ I i ( x , y ) ( ∑ i = 1 N w i I i ( x , y ) ) ] 1 m . I i ' ( x , y ) This would apply to the matrix-based, linear colour space transformations such as YIQ, YUV, YCbCr, etc, where the intensity/luminance notation can be appropriately substituted (though the expression may be of similar or greater complexity than the linear colour conversion operations). Finally, in practice, we select m =1 or 2 for ease of operations and hardware implementation amenability, resulting in a linear or square root operation. The summary of the experiments and observations is as follows; • The initial scheme utilizing only the weighted intensity model did not yield considerable colour balancing, which is achieved with saturation tuning in the HSI and HSV colour spaces. • Certain colour images match the Intensity channel model of the HSI colour conversion and yield consistent results. The non-ideal colour images are more suited to the hybrid I–V model and the latter model yields good results for most colour images processed. • The system avoids colour space transformation and enhances the colour improvement attribute of the algorithm it is combined with. • The system targets the inherent relationship between the R, G and B channels and thus its generality is satisfied based on experiments, indicating that the relationship between R, G and B channels is a reasonably predictable one. • Finally, it is evident that this scheme appears to take a form similar to that of the colour restoration function employed in the MSRCR and also similar to the Ratio Rule method, but with reduced complexity and no iterations or canonical parameters. With the foundations of the colour enhancement operator elucidated, we proceed with experiments to fine tune the algorithm for outlier images. After that, we then proceed with the augmentation of several conventional image contrast enhancement and illumination correction algorithms, which usually perform poorly for colour images. 4.4 Dynamic computation of the m parameter for fully adaptive colour enhancement It was discovered in the course of further experiments that setting the same value for the m parameter for each of the R, G and B channels results in inconsistencies for some images. This is due to the fact that the results of the m value are dependent on the nature of the algorithm and the image being processed. For example, for some images, m =1 is adequate while for others it leads to over- or under-enhancement of colours. Conversely, for other images, a value of m =1 or increasing the value of m resulted in faded colours. Thus, it was imperative to obtain a standard formulation that enabled the consistent enhancement of colours that were derived from the image attributes rather than a fixed parameter. Subsequently, other image statistical parameters were explored in order to obtain values for enhancement of colour images. The mean and standard deviation proved unreliable and yielded highly distorted results while the mode once more proved to be the measure of choice for best results. Initial attempts using the mode utilized the following formulation; (26) r = R + G + B R ; g = R + G + B G ; b = R + G + B B (27) m r = m o d e ( r ) ; m g = m o d e ( g ) ; m b = m o d e ( b ) However, this formulation yielded inconsistent results for images with unequal modal ratios. As a result, some image results depicted colour enhancement or preservation/retention while others yielded faded colours, which was the drawback of the earlier mentioned image enhancement algorithms. The next alternative was to utilize the result from (21) in the expression; (28) r = R I V ; g = G I V ; b = B I V ; I V = α I + β V (29) m r = m o d e ( r ) ; m g = m o d e ( g ) ; m b = m o d e ( b ) (30) m = m r + m g + m b 3 The mean value of the modal (MOM) values could then be used to enhance all three channels and preserve the colour relationships of all three channels or at worst, enhance the colour relationship rather than degrade it. However certain images yield zero values for these modal parameters for either red, green or blue channels. This skewers the mean value once more leading to inconsistent results. In other words, performing a simple mean of modal values does not work well for all images, leading to spurious results when either m r =0, m g =0 or m b =0. Thus, we remove all zero entries and compute the mean of the remaining, non-zero entries. This ensures constant and consistent enhancement, while avoiding colour fading in all image enhancement results. Since the mode is more stable, the clustering of the colour component pixels (particles) around the mode should be consistent and this has been observed in other work [41,42]. 5 Experiments and comparisons The results in this section are presented to verify the claims made concerning the proposed colour enhancement/restoration algorithm (PA). The first part introduces the relevant metrics used in assessing image quality and how they are interpreted in results. The second part deals with the augmentation of the colour enhancement abilities of existing greyscale image-based contrast enhancement algorithms with PA. The third and fourth section compare PA with other relevant colour spaces and colour enhancement algorithms from the literature respectively. The fifth section discusses the justification for the substitution of the AMF within the EPF component of the SLIP-GUM algorithm for reduced computational time. The sixth section deals with attempts to adaptively determine the type and degree of degradation (unbalanced colour or uneven illumination) of the input image prior to processing. 5.1 Image quality metrics The visual and quantitative results are presented to verify the claims made about the proposed algorithm. The quantitative measures for evaluation include the Colourfulness (C) [40], Colour Enhancement Measurement (EMEC) [43], Average Gradient (AG) and Hue Deviation Index (HDI) [44] and entropy. The relevant mathematical expressions for these measures are shown in Eqs. (31)–(36). These are in addition to computation of mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the image, I in addition to the Contrast Enhancement Factor (CEF). (31) C E F = σ 2 μ ; μ = 1 M N ∑ i = 1 M ∑ j = 1 N I ( i , j ) ; σ 2 = 1 M N ∑ i = 1 M ∑ j = 1 N [ I ( i , j ) − μ ] 2 (32) e n t r o p y = ∑ i n ( − p i * log ( p i ) ) (33) A G = 1 M N ∑ x = 1 M ∑ y = 1 N [ I ( x + 1 , y ) − I ( x , y ) ] 2 + [ I ( x , y + 1 ) − I ( x , y ) ] 2 2 (34) C = σ α 2 + σ β 2 + 0.3 μ α 2 + μ β 2 (35) E M E C = 1 k 1 k 2 ∑ k = 1 k 1 ∑ l = 1 k 2 20 log [ m a x k , l ( I R , I G , I B ) m i n k , l ( I R , I G , I B ) ] (36) H D I = [ 1 M N ∑ i = 1 M ∑ j = 1 N m i n ( | X ( i , j ) − Y ( i , j ) | , 1 − | X ( i , j ) − Y ( i , j ) | ) ] × 100 % For all relevant Eqs. in (31)–(36), M and N are the image dimensions depicting rows and columns respectively. For Eq. (31) the term σ 2, is the variance and its square root is the standard deviation as mentioned earlier. In Eq. (32), p i is the normalized histogram of the image of bin element, i and n is the total number of bins and higher entropy implies that details are enhanced. For Eq. (33), I, is the processed image and any increase in AG implies increased contrast. In Eq. (34), α= R − G, β = ( R + G 2 ) − B , μ α, σ α, μ β and σ β are the mean and standard deviations of α and β respectively while R, G and B are the red, green and blue channels of either original or processed colour image and increase in colourfulness implies colour enhancement. Human-based subjective rankings can be objectively estimated using some defined metrics [40]. Thus, this metric is useful since it had a correlation of over 90% with human subjective evaluation results obtained from psychophysical experiments according to its originators [40]. Thus, we expect that increased colourfulness value of processed images would be seen as more colourful by most humans. Furthermore, results by Mukherjee show that colourfulness metric is not considerably affected by compression level though blockiness increases with increasing compression level [32]. This makes the colourfulness metric a robust and reliable parameter for assessment. In (35), the RGB colour image, I = ( I R , I G , I B ) , while k 1 and k 2 are the size of the blocks chosen for subdivision of the image, k and l are the row and column indices of the image; also increased EMEC signifies improved colour. In Eq. (36), Y ( i , j ) is the processed hue channel and X ( i , j ) is the original hue channel of HSI or HSV transformed RGB colour image. For the HDI, a lower value means that there is reduced colour distortion or deviation from the original colour image signifying good hue preservation properties (good cohesion among particles) and measures appropriate colourfulness value based on regulated dilation of particles. Additionally, the ratios of the values obtained from the processed and unprocessed images are obtained and provided for comparisons. If the ratios are less than 1, then there is degradation while ratio values greater than 1 imply improvement or enhancement. The ratio of the HDI is not computed since the metric utilizes the original and processed images in computation of the deviation parameter. The flowchart for the entire experimental system setup is shown in Fig. 7 . The details of determination of colour balance of the input colour image and checking for adequate colour correction is explained in subsequent sections. 5.2 Colour enhancement of images processed with greyscale-based algorithms This section presents results visually observed in images processed with the proposed colour enhancement scheme combined with existing illumination correction and contrast enhancement algorithms. We compare results using the swan image [5] processed with HSI, HSV, RGB and IV-based versions of the GHE, AHE, CLAHE, spatial HF (SHF) and frequency domain HF (FDHF), MSR, HS and GUM algorithms and shown in Fig. 8 . The visual and numerical results in Fig. 8 and Table 2 show that the proposed colour enhancement approach is consistent and improves colour rendition in the processed images. In Fig. 8, AHE, GHE and HS yield the most noticeable distortions in colour while the log-ratio (LR) and logarithmic image processing(LIP)-based approaches such as the Homomorphic filters (SHF & FDHF), MSR and LIP-GUM yield less distortion though more colour fading is observed. However, the HF and MSR algorithms yield the least distortion for the LIP-based approaches due to their excellent dynamic range compression abilities, while the MSR combines large scale and small scale features to preserve the multi-scale features of the image scene. We also compare the proposed algorithm with the results of Ratio Rule, HSI version of the spatial Homomorphic filter, RGB-IV spatial HF, MSRCR and HSV-SLIP-GUM in Fig. 9 and results show that the algorithm yields better results than the other approaches, while being relatively less complex compared to the Ratio Rule and MSRCR versions. For example, the sky is much more colourful in Fig. 9(d) when compared with the other results while there is more contrast in the sky for SLIP-GUM result due to the CLAHE contrast enhancement component. For the swan image used, the initial values for EMEC_1, Colourfulness (CMA), mean (mu_i), standard deviation (sigma_i), entropy (e_i) and average gradient (AG_i) are 13.43151,15.63302,52.18342,62.46685, 6.564669 and 5.813808 respectively. The output values of the corresponding metrics are shown in Table 3 . In both tables, the first row of each sub-table is for processing in RGB space without the proposed approach (RGB) while the second row in each sub-table is for processing in RGB space using the proposed algorithm (RGB-IV). The results in Table 2 show that for colour enhancement metrics such as relative colour enhancement (RC), relative CEF (F), relative EMEC (REMEC), the proposed colour enhancement algorithm gives consistently higher values than the standard RGB-based approaches. The colourfulness and EMEC values have increased while the HDI value has dropped considerably, indicating that the colour enhancement algorithm has reduced the hue deviation and avoided colour distortion effect of the various algorithms, thus the lower HDI can be seen as better cohesion of colour components. In general, the proposed scheme yields improved colour rendition when combined with grey-scale based enhancement algorithms for processing RGB colour images. 5.3 Comparisons with relevant colour spaces from the literature The proposed approach is also compared with the relevant colour spaces in this section and results indicate improved colourfulness compared to nonlinear colour spaces such as HSI and HSV systems. Due to space constraints, we only present a sample of the results for the HF algorithm instance. The image results and corresponding RGB plots are shown in Fig. 9, while the plots of metrics of images processed with alternate colour space implementations of the HF are shown in Fig. 10 . In some cases, (shoe image [5] in Fig. 9) the RGB-IV result is visually indistinguishable from the HSI-based scheme while in other cases, it yields clearly richer colours and saturation without bleeding (light-house and surfers images [5]). The colour fading is clearly observed in the standard RGB result of the HF in Fig. 9 and which has the lowest RC/CEF and REMEC values in the plots in Fig. 10. Also, observing the RGB colour plots in Fig. 9, there is less spreading of the channels in relation to each other using RGB compared to HSI and RGB-IV-based schemes. We illustrate this point with the plots of RC/CEF, HDI and EMEC in Fig. 10 for the processed images. The HDI can be used as a measure of the degree of spread since too much dilation leads to colour distortion, while excessive contraction results in fading corresponding to very high HDI (RGB result), while a moderate HDI indicates adequate dilation (RGB-IV result) and minimal HDI yields the ideal balance, as observed in results using HSI and HSV colour spaces. 5.4 Comparisons with other algorithms from the literature We also compare the proposed scheme with other colour enhancement algorithms from the literature such as MSRCR, Ratio rule-based HF, HSI-HF, HSV-GUM and DCT-based CES versions. The results in Fig. 11 indicate that best results are obtained with PA compared to the DCT-based method [32] and RGB, HSI variants of the HF for the surfer, shoe and light house images from [5]. Additionally, we also observe that PA gives the highest colourfulness of all the processed image results in Fig. 11 and Table 4 compared to other approaches from the literature, based on CEF/RC values. It should be noted that several of these other approaches still require processing in the HSV/HSI/YUV/YCbCr colour space to improve colour rendition results. Conversely, PA can replicate and improve on these results since it can mimic any of the colour spaces without performing the full forward or reverse transformations. The expression for estimating computational complexity given by [32] as; a A + m M + E e is employed, where a is the number of additions, m is the number of multiplications and e is the number of exponential operations per pixel. However, the estimates from [32] do not include divisions and logarithms or incorporate the iterative nature of the DCT-based CES algorithm. We include divisions and logarithmic operations per pixel as d and l in the amended expression given as; a A + m M + e E + d D + l L omitting max/min, modal, mean, trigonometric and compare operations. We compare structural complexity of algorithms in Table 5 . Based on results, the proposed scheme contributes minimal multiplication operations, though it has a relatively large number of division operations per pixel. Only the HSI and HSV forward conversion operations are taken into account in the calculation of their computational complexity. It is also not clear whether the algorithms proposed by [32] included the calculations of the operations for the colour space conversions utilised in their approach. It is also observed that the MSRCR has the highest computational complexity as noted in [32]. In summary, PA attempts to address colour distortion and improve consistency of results, while introducing automation with moderate complexity. Having made the case for the PA, we proceed with reducing the run-time of the earlier mentioned GUM algorithm. 5.5 Edge preserving filter (EPF) replacement in GUM The AMF, which functions as the EPF component in the GUM algorithm is of considerable computational complexity and this adds to the increased run-time of the GUM algorithm. Thus, for the EPF component, we explore three contemporary filters that surpass the edge preserving properties of the AMF based on PSNR, SSIM, MAE and MSE measurements [45] (see also [46]). These three filters include; • The Noise Adaptive Fuzzy Switching Median Filter (NAFSMF) [47] • Entropy guided Switching Trimmed Mean Deviation-boosted Anisotropic Diffusion filter (STMDF-AD) [45] • The Efficient Weighted Average (EWA) Filter [48] The results are shown in Fig. 12 and the mesa image from [11] was processed using the modified GUM algorithm with the aforementioned filters as EPF replacements. For the NAFSMF, the processing of the canyon image is about 0.037363s, while the processing time for AMF is about 6.561111s and for the STMDF-AD, the processing time is about 4.194520s for one iteration. Lastly, for the EWA filter, the processing time is about 0.336881seconds. Thus based on results, the NAFSMF is the least computationally complex filter and also the fastest while yielding visually similar results to the AMF and EWA filter (which is the second fastest edge preserving filter). The STMDF-AD filter is the second slowest and most complex of the chosen EPFs. Also, its results do not work well in some regions of the processed image since it performs a thresholding effect though there is evidence of increased colour enhancement (Fig. 13 (a)). Either the EWA filter or the NAFSMF can be selected as a EPF replacement, drastically reducing the run-time of the LIP-GUM and SLIP GUM algorithms as a result. We also replace the HSV component with the PA in the GUM algorithm and compare performance. A summary of results is presented in Table 6 for processing the RGB colour swan image with dimensions 385×513. Results show that the STMDF-AD yields the highest values for F and RSD while the NAFSMF yields the best EMEC, RM, RAG values and lowest runtimes. The RGB-IV-based GUM yields the highest RC values and lower runtimes than the HSV-based GUM algorithm. However, the HDI is higher than for the HSV, since hue is not considerably modified in the HSV colour space. Nevertheless, the HDI varies depending on the image being processed, while the RGB-IV scheme yields better results than the standard RGB version and is much faster than the HSI and HSV versions of the SLIP-GUM algorithm (due to parallelization). Moreover, the image results from both HSV and RGB-IV versions of the SLIP-GUM in Fig. 13 are quite similar and bolded values in Table 6 indicate better results. With the RGB-IV and the EPF substitutions, the run-time of the SLIP-GUM algorithm is drastically reduced, while colour and contrast enhancement results are more or less maintained. Thus, the proposed colour enhancement algorithm allows the option of processing in the RGB space, while emulating the visual, colourful results of the HSI/HSV colour spaces and considerably reducing execution time of the algorithms it augments. 5.6 Classification of image colour quality attributes and limitations of PA It is important to note that although the proposed colour enhancement works well for balanced colour images, it is not suitable for images with haze or dominant colour casts such as underwater images. These images are predominantly blue or green since the blue light has the shortest wavelength and penetrates at greater depths than the other colours [49]. Based on this fact, we attempt to classify images based on the perceptual metrics and also on the modal ratio values of the various images obtained in Table 1. The aim is to understand the limitations of the proposed approach and to predict which images suffer from colour imbalance in order to automatically correct them prior to processing especially those suffering from uneven illumination. It should be noted that though several illumination correction algorithms can perform colour correction on some images, their results are usually not consistent. Also, some images which do not visually exhibit this colour imbalance may still be affected by colour correction algorithms, especially if their dynamic range is not fully utilized. Thus a colour correction stage should be applied only when necessary and we perform some experiments to enable us obtain more information about these types of images. We utilize the mean and the standard deviation of the hue, saturation and value components to help quantify the amount of clustering and dispersion around the mean value for each of the components. It may be deduced that such high variation is an indication of greatly increased contrast as observed in previous works [4,32]. Based on the preliminary experiments we were able to infer three classes of colour images namely; • Dark colour images with uneven illumination (and dominant colour cast) • Colour images with shadows/uneven illumination • Faded colour images with dominant colour cast Further extensive experiments were performed involving 195 natural images of various types of illumination used by various authors in the literature (see image references). Based on some prior simplistic assumptions; images with the histograms skewed to the right of the distribution are likely to be faded or bright images while those skewed to the left are likely to be the dark images. For the clustered dataset in Fig. 14 , lower mean and standard deviation values imply dark images while higher mean and standard deviation values imply brighter images. However, this scheme appears too ambiguous and may make it difficult to properly classify some images. Thus, the images are converted to greyscale from which a binary mask is generated, then the area of light vs black pixels is computed to determine if the image is dark or light. Based on the plot in 14(c), it is visually clear that the proportion of black pixels is always greater than the proportion of white pixels, thus confirming that all the tested images can be visually perceived as predominantly dark. However, there are varying degrees of proportions based on the different peaks of both white and dark pixel counts, thus the second class of images where the area of black and white pixels is roughly equal. This makes it difficult to accurately predict since some images may have more dark pixels than bright ones but will have them spread out evenly, thus having the appearance of a reasonably bright image with shadow regions. This could lead to the image being misclassified as a dark image and processed accordingly. Other factors include the thresholding function used and accuracy of the selected threshold value, which may move additional pixels below or above the selected threshold. The particular scheme utilized for this experiment is Otsu’s algorithm [50], which computes an adaptive threshold. Experiments were repeated for images with dominant colour cast to determine these features numerically. and the results are presented in Fig. 15 . For the plot in Fig. 15(a), the 195 images have their hue components measured for mean and standard deviation and show high values for both quantities with some correlation. However, in the case of 35 underwater images with dominant blue colour cast, the mean and standard deviations of the hue components are quite low and appear to be uncorrelated in 15(b). The images are then colour corrected and have their respective hues measured once more using the mean and standard deviations in 15(c). There is an observed general increase in standard deviation, and variance (contrast) while the mean generally has decreased. The proposed colour enhancement scheme is applied to dark images with dominant colour casts by comparing the mean and standard deviation values of the hue components. An increase or decrease in standard deviation will indicate the effectiveness of the colour enhancement for such images. However, the scheme mostly yields over-saturation of colour corrected images since these do not have faded colours. Thus, it is generally ineffective for underwater images, which are better served by previously developed algorithms in the literature. The findings indicate that a mainly colour correction or white balancing algorithm does not have considerable contrast enhancement or illumination correction effect on images, which are not suffering from dominant colour cast. However, utilizing a strong contrast enhancement algorithm (which depends on the input image statistics such as standard deviation or mean) will drastically alter the results, considerably modifying the image histogram and consequently, the pixel intensity values in each of the R, G and B channels [3,51,52]. The HSI and HSV-based algorithms cannot perform proper colour correction since their inherent strengths of hue preservation and decoupling, works against colour correction, which must be performed in RGB space for images with colour cast. However, for contrast enhancement and illumination correction, only the intensity component (for images without colour cast problems) is usually processed. In summary, an ideal colour correction algorithm should only affect the hue and (or) saturation component and not distort the RGB colour relationships of the three channels. Conversely, an ideal contrast enhancement and illumination correction algorithm should modify only the pixel intensities and eliminate uneven illumination without distortion of the hue/saturation components. However, this is rarely achievable in practice due to the non-linear nature of most contemporary algorithms, thus the need for processing in the HSI and HSV colour spaces. It has been shown that the proposed scheme helps to somewhat mitigate this imperfection of contrast enhancement and illumination correction algorithms enabling improved colour processing in RGB space. However, for images with dominant colour cast, the proposed algorithm is unsuitable due to initial incorrect colour composition of such images. Thus, by extracting features that help describe this dominancy in such images, a colour dominance degree detection scheme can be used to determine suitability for such images. 6 Discussions and possible application areas Based on experiments and observable results, the proposed approach eliminates colour fading and distortions usually associated with application of greyscale image enhancement algorithms to RGB colour images. The proposed approach is fast and naturally parallelizable while being relatively easier to implement in FPGA hardware using either fixed or floating point scheme, yielding visually comparable results similar to HSI and HSV-based approaches. The colour bleeding effect observed with processing certain images in the HSI colour space has been mitigated by the combined I–V and adaptive approach. Future possibilities include optimized implementation of the colour enhancement system in hardware for comparison with previous work utilizing HSI and HSV colour spaces in terms of both speed, hardware resource usage and performance. Ultimately, the proposed colour enhancement algorithm due to its generality, can be applied in digital colour photography, tone mapping techniques and remote sensing. Future work will explore the application of the algorithm to other areas in more detail. 7 Conclusion A fast and generalized colour enhancement model has been proposed in this work and shows performance gains in image colour fidelity and reduced complexity. The proposed approach can be modified to mimic the results of any colour space without performing the full transformation in that colour space. This results in cost savings in hardware and faster operation on devices with limited memory and real-time constraints. The colour enhancement algorithm is non-iterative and based on the colourfulness and HDI measure yields excellent and consistent colour enhancement compared to naïve RGB implementations. An adaptive pre-colour correction stage is performed for (dark) images suffering from dominant colour cast prior to colour enhancement and illumination correction as determined from the modal ratio values and statistical parameters of the hue component. Furthermore," we have also improved the effectiveness of the SLIP-GUM algorithm by substitution of the colour and EPF component drastically reducing execution time while maintaining similar results obtained in HSV/HSI domain using the proposed colour enhancement scheme.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.09.121,"Structural, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 films decorated with plasmonic silver nanoparticles","Abstract Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were deposited on porous TiO2 films by photodeposition method. TiO2 films were prepared by Sol-Gel dip-coating technique and the porous TiO2 films (PTiO2) were elaborated by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the starting solution. The effect of UV irradiation time (t UV), used for the deposition of Ag NPs, on structural, optical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of silver loaded porous TiO2 films (Ag/PTiO2) was studied. The Ag NPs were found to be homogeneously dispersed on PTiO2 films surfaces. The plasmonic effect in Ag/PTiO2 films is evidenced by the drastic change in the visible light absorption. Under simulated solar light, Ag/PTiO2 samples show a higher PEC activity compared with PTiO2 film. The highest PEC activity was obtained for tUV =15min and for longer UV illumination PEC response decreased.",Feb-18," Keywords TiO2 Thin films Ag nanoparticles Sol-Gel Photodeposition Photoelectrochemical 1 Introduction During the last years, titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films have been the subject of a growing number of studies due to their interesting physical and chemical properties. Titanium dioxide is a low cost, nontoxic and corrosion resistant material with high chemical stability [1]. It can be crystalized in three main polymorphs: Anatase, Rutile and brookite [2]. TiO2 is a wide band gap semiconductor (3.26eV for Anatase phase and 3.05eV for rutile) [3] with high refractive index (2.75 for Rutile and 2.54 for Anatase at 550nm wavelength) [4]. These properties make it suitable for a variety of applications such as in dye-sensitized solar cells [5,6], gas sensors [7] and biosensors [8]. Furthermore, TiO2 has been largely studied for its photoinduced properties including photocatalysis [9], superhydrophilicity [10] and antibacterial activity [11]. Due to its low cost, non-toxicity and biocompatibility, TiO2 is considered among other semiconductors to be the most promising and reliable photocatalyst for environmental applications [12]. However, the use of TiO2 as a photocatalyst has two main limitations. The first is the necessity of using UV irradiation to activate the photocatalytic mechanism. The second is the rapid recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs which leads to a reduction in the photocatalytic efficiency [13]. Therefore, many methods have been developed to overcome these constraints by doping with metallic or non-metallic elements [14], co-doping [15,16], coupling with other semiconductors in composite materials [17], surface decorating with noble metals nanoparticles [18] and with silver based nanocomposites such as Ag/AgBr [19] and Ag/AgCl [20].Among these strategies, loading TiO2 films with noble metals nanoparticles (Au, Ag, Pt and Pd) seems to be one of the most interesting approaches to increase the photoactive efficiency in the visible region [21]. The localized surface plasmonic resonance effect (LSPR) of noble metallic nanoparticles contributes to an increase of the absorption in the visible region [22], which is very benefic for enhancing the photoinduced properties efficiency using solar light. Compared to other noble metals, Ag has attracted much interest due to its low cost and abundance [23], making it suitable for industrial applications [24]. In addition, Ag exhibits an antibacterial activity and a higher performance in the decomposition of aqueous phase pollutants [25]. Ag NPs are usually prepared from colloidal solutions via chemical routes. The main drawback of these methods is the necessity of adding organic stabilizing agents and the instability of the colloid solutions over time [26]. Photodeposition synthesis of silver nanoparticles, which is the technique adopted in this work, is based on the irradiation of photocatalically active support in order to reduce silver ions. This method seems to be an interesting alternative due to its simplicity and low cost. It is also considered as an environment-friendly technique because it offers the possibility of preparing silver nanoparticles without the use of organic additives. Recently, many studies reported on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants using Ag loaded TiO2 films. However, a fewer number focused on their PEC activity. The surface morphology of TiO2 films has a great influence on the PEC response. Among the various morphologies of TiO2, nanotubes have been intensively studied due to their larger specific surface area and vertical orientation leading to a high PEC activity. The idea of this work is to use simple and low cost techniques (Sol-Gel dip-coating for TiO2 and photodeposition for Silver nanoparticles) to obtain silver loaded TiO2 films with PEC response comparable to that obtained from Ag loaded TiO2 nanotubes prepared by the relatively complex and expensive anodization process. To obtain TiO2 films with high specific surface area, PEG was added to the Sol-Gel starting solution. PEG is decomposed during the annealing process leading to the formation of a rough and porous surface. In this work, we studied the structural, optical and PEC properties of porous TiO2 films decorated with Ag NPs. A mechanism explaining the effect of UV irradiation time, during silver photodeposition process, on the PEC response is suggested. 2 Experimental 2.1 TiO2 films preparation The TiO2 films were prepared by sol-gel dip-coating technique. The starting solution was made of titanium tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP, Sigma-Aldrich 97%) as a precursor, isopropanol (2-PrOH) as a solvent, distilled water, hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%) as a catalyst, and polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG) as an organic additive which was incorporated to obtain crack free and porous films. TIIP:2-PrOH:H2O:HCl:PEG molar ratio was equal to 1:20:1:1:0.02. Firstly, a mixture of isopropanol and HCl was prepared then distilled water was added. After that, TTIP was dissolved in the as prepared solution under continuous stirring and finally PEG was added. The obtained solution was vigorously stirred for 1h until the formation of a homogeneous and transparent solution. Another solution with the same composition, but without adding PEG, was prepared following the same procedure. The prepared films were deposited on glass substrates (microscope glass slides) and on ITO substrates. The glass substrates were cleaned in ultrasonic bath by acetone and ethanol, then rinsed with distilled water while the ITO substrates were cleaned by isopropanol and distilled water. Subsequently, the glass and ITO substrates were dipped and withdrawn in the prepared solutions with a speed of 1mm/s. The as deposited films were then dried at 70°C for 10min and the dipping-withdrawing cycles were repeated 6 times for each sample. Finally, the obtained films were annealed in air at 520°C for 1h. 2.2 Silver nanoparticles deposition on TiO2 films Silver nanoparticles were deposited on the prepared PTiO2 films by the photodeposition technique. A silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution with a molarity of 1mM was prepared by dissolving AgNO3 in distilled water. The prepared solution was then cast on the surface of the annealed TiO2 films and irradiated by a UV–365nm 20W BLB lamp for 10,15 and 25min. The distance between the samples and the UV lamp was set to 5cm. Finally, the obtained samples were abundantly rinsed with distilled water and dried in air. The prepared samples were labeled as following: PTiO2 (porous films) and TiO2 for the samples prepared with and without PEG, respectively. PTiO2-10, PTiO2-15 and PTiO2-25 are Ag loaded PTiO2 films prepared with 10, 15 and 25min of UV irradiation time, respectively. 2.3 Analysis The crystalline phase identification was performed using grazing incidence X ray diffraction (GIXRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD patterns were obtained by means of Philips XPERT PRO MPD using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406Å). Raman spectra were recorded using Bruker Senterra R200L with argon ion laser (532nm) as an excitation source. The samples were illuminated with 20mW of laser power and the spectral data were collected in the continuous scan mode. Surface morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM micrographs were obtained in the backscattering mode by means of Philips XL30 ESEM FEG SEM with an accelerating voltage of 20KV. The RMS surface roughness values of the prepared films were measured using MFP-3D Oxford Instruments company Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). UV–visible absorption spectra were obtained using Jasco V570 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. PEC measurements were performed in a Solarton analytical SI 1287 electrochemical workstation with a standard three electrodes system using a quartz cell. The working electrode consisted of the prepared samples, Pt wire coil as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The used electrolyte was composed of 0.01M NaOH+0.1M Na2SO4. The illumination source was a solar simulator with AM 1.5 illumination (100mW/cm2). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were recorded in the range −1 to 1V with a scan rate of 20mV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural properties 3.1.1 XRD analysis The XRD spectra of PTiO2 and Ag/PTiO2 thin films deposited on ITO substrates are displayed in Fig. 1 . All the films present five strong diffraction peaks located at 21.51°, 30.57°, 35.40°, 51.04° and 60.70°. These peaks are attributed to the ITO substrate. We also note the presence of two small peaks at 25.28° and 37.80° which are assigned to TiO2 Anatase (101) and (004) planes, respectively (JCPDS No. 21-1272). No diffraction peak of silver is detected which can be explained by the dominance of the ITO peaks in the spectrum with their high intensities, making it difficult to detect silver existing in low amounts. To confirm silver deposition, the films deposited on glass substrates were studied by GIXRD. XRD patterns of PTiO2 and Ag/PTiO2 films deposited on glass substrates are shown in Fig. 2 . All the samples exhibit an intense peak located at 25.28°, which is related to TiO2 Anatase (101) plane (JCPDS. No. 21–1272). No characteristic peaks of other TiO2 phases besides Anatase were detected, indicating that the prepared samples are pure TiO2 Anatase which is known for its high photocatalytic reactivity [27]. A diffraction peak located at 38.18° was detected only for Ag/PTiO2 films and not for PTiO2. This peak is assigned to silver (111) plane (JCPDS No. 04-0783). In addition, the intensity of Ag (111) peak increases with tUV increasing which is ascribed to the growth of the loaded silver amount. It is worthy to note that no diffraction peak of silver oxides phases was detected, indicating that the photodeposited particles are pure metallic silver without traces of silver oxides. 3.1.2 RAMAN analysis Fig. 3 shows Raman spectra of PTiO2 and Ag/PTiO2 films deposited on ITO substrates. All the films present a peak at 144cm−1 corresponding to the (Eg) TiO2 Anatase vibrational mode [28]. We note that the intensity of the Anatase peak of both PTiO2-10 and PTiO2-15 films is higher than that of PTiO2 film. This Raman signal amelioration can be attributed to the surface enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) properties of Ag [29]. No amelioration of Raman spectrum intensity is observed for PTiO2-25 film indicating that the sample does not present SERS effect. On the contrary, the PTiO2-25 spectrum intensity is lower than that of PTiO2. The PTiO2-25 Raman signal intensity decrease might be ascribed to the high amount of silver deposited on the film’s surface which will screen the exciting laser from reaching the film in Ag particles deposition sites. Consequently, the Raman spectrum intensity decreases due to the less interaction between the exciting laser and the film crystals. 3.2 Morphological study SEM micrographs of the prepared samples are illustrated in Fig. 4 . For TiO2 film, the surface morphology is smooth and homogeneous, while for PTiO2 film (with 2% PEG) the surface becomes rough and porous. The difference in surface morphology is explained by the formation of pores in PTiO2 films resulting from the thermal decomposition of PEG during the annealing process. PEG is completely decomposed at 520°C [30], which is the annealing temperature of the prepared samples. For the silver loaded films we observe the presence of homogeneously dispersed white spots which represent the silver nanoparticles photocatalytically grown. When TiO2 film is illuminated with a radiation having an energy corresponding to its band gap, electron-hole pairs are formed. The photogenerated electrons will then reduce the adsorbed silver ions Ag+ into metallic Ag0 silver [31]: TiO2 +hν →h+ +e − Ag+ ads +e − →Ag0 Other photocatalytically formed chemical species, beside electrons and holes, including OH radicals, O2 − ions, H2O2 and O2 might also be involved in the silver deposition mechanism [26]. In addition, Ag particles size increases with increasing UV irradiation time from 10 to 25min. Similar results were reported by Piwoński et al. [26] and Chen et al. [32], indicating an increase of the photodeposited silver particles size with UV irradiation time increasing. According to Piwoński et al. [26], the growth of the initially formed silver clusters is more favored than the growth from other adsorbed Ag+ active sites which explains the silver particles size increasing for longer UV illuminations. The silver particles size can be controlled by monitoring the photodeposition parameters including the intensity, duration and nature of the irradiation (continuous or pulsed) [26] and also the chemical composition of the used silver precursor [33]. The roughness of Ag/PTiO2 surface films has a considerable influence on the PEC response of the prepared films. The roughness root mean square values (RMS) of TiO2, PTiO2, PTiO2-10, PTiO2-15, and PTiO2-25 are 1.0, 3.8, 10.4, 7.8 and 9.5nm, respectively. We note that the roughness of PTiO2 film is higher than that of TiO2 which is due the decomposition of PEG during the annealing process. We also note that all the silver loaded PTiO2 films present a higher roughness compared with PTiO2 film which will contribute in the enhancement of the PEC response. 3.3 Optical properties Fig. 5 depicts the UV–vis absorption spectra of PTiO2 and Ag/PTiO2 films. For all the films we observe the presence of high absorption region below 400nm which is due to the intrinsic TiO2 band gap transition from the valence band formed by 2p orbitals of the oxide anions to the conduction band formed by 3d t2g orbitals of Ti4+ cations [34]. Compared with PTiO2 film, Ag loaded PTiO2 films exhibit an enhancement of the absorption in the entire visible region. This absorption amelioration is ascribed to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in Ag NPs [22,32,35]. The LSPR excitation is achieved when the time varying electric field of the incident light drives a collective oscillation of the Ag NPs free electrons. At a particular frequency, the oscillating electrons will be in resonance with the incident light resulting in a strong oscillation of the surface electrons which is characterized by an enhancement of visible light absorption and the presence of a peak in the absorption spectrum. We also note that the absorption increases with tUV increase from 10 to 15min which is attributed to the increase of the loaded Ag amount. The absorption spectra of PTiO2-10 and PTiO2-15 films exhibit a broad absorption peaks centered at 400 and 483nm corresponding to their LSPR frequencies, respectively. The absorption peak maximum presents a red shift with tUV increasing which might be attributed to silver particles size increasing [36,37]. As it can be observed, the absorption in the visible region decreased for PTiO2-25 film. According to Rycenga et al. [22] and Wu et al. [37], LSPR extinction (the sum of light absorption and scattering) for silver nanoparticles is dominated by absorption for smaller silver particles. As the particles size increases, the scattering takes over. In this work, we think that absorption predominates the LSPR extinction behavior for PTiO2-10 and PTiO2-15. However with the increase in Ag particles size, as for PTiO2-25, the scattering takes over. Consequently, a decrease of the absorption is noticed for PTiO2-25 film. Similar results are reported by Chen et al. [32] indicating a decrease of the visible light absorption for TiO2 nanotubes decorated with Ag NPs photodeposited with longer UV irradiation times. 3.4 Electrochemical properties In to order investigate the effect of PEG addition and silver nanoparticles loading on PEC response of the prepared TiO2 films, cyclic voltammetry was performed. The cyclic voltamogramms of PTiO2 and TiO2 films in dark and under simulated solar light irradiation are displayed in Fig. 6 . As expected, in dark conditions the current density values of both of TiO2 and PTiO2 films are negligibly small and practically identical. Under light conditions a photogneretaed current is observed with a current density value higher than that in dark. The presence of a current under light conditions is attributed to the transfer of photogenerated electrons, excited by the small UV fraction present in the simulated solar light spectrum, to the ITO substrate and then injected in the outer circuit. Furthermore, the photocurrent generated from PTiO2 film is higher than that generated from TiO2 film which can be explained by the porous surface morphology of PTiO2 film leading to a higher specific surface area. Cyclic voltammograms of PTiO2 and Ag/PTiO2 films under simulated solar light are illustrated in Fig. 7 . All the samples present a cathodic peak PC1 which is attributed to hydrogen evolution [32]. Anodic peaks PA1, PA2 and cathodic shoulder PC2 are observed only for Ag/PTiO2 films and not for PTiO2. PA1 and PA2 are related to the oxidation of silver leading to the formation of Ag2O on different Ag crystalline planes [38] and the cathodic shoulder PC2 is assigned to the reduction of the anodically formed oxide. Ag is oxidized by OH− ions present in the solution as described by the following reaction [39]: 2Ag+2OH− ↔Ag2O+H2O+2e− Gross et al. [38] performed electrochemical measurements for Ag loaded TiO2 nanotubes under the same experimental conditions and using the same electrolyte composition (0.01M NaOH+0.1M Na2SO4). The Ag oxidation peak was obtained at −0.22V vs MSE (Mercury sulfate electrode), this value corresponds to 0.22V vs SCE which is practically the same value obtained in our work for the anodic peak PA1. In addition, the intensity of the oxidation peak PA2 for PTiO2-25 film is higher than that of PA1 which is due to the increase of the loaded silver amount. Furthermore, the value of the photocurrent generated from all Ag/PTiO2 films is higher than that generated from PTiO2. The photocurrent density increases with tUV increase reaching its highest value for tUV =15min. After that it decreases for tUV =25min. The saturated photocurrent density values of PTiO2, PTiO2-10, PTiO2-15 and PTiO2-25 are about 17.60, 32.28, 41.87 and 28.81μAcm−2, respectively. These photocurrent values are higher than those obtained by Gross et al. for Ag loaded TiO2 nanotubes under visible light illumination [38] and they are comparable to the values obtained by Jiao et al. [40] for silver decorated TiO2 nanotubes. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out for PTiO2-15 (the film with the highest PEC response) using 0.5M Na2SO4 as electrolyte. Cyclic voltammograms of PTiO2-15 in dark and under simulated solar light are presented in Fig. 8 . As expected, the dark current density is negligible. Upon irradiation, an important increase in the photocurrent density is observed. The saturated photocurrent density of PTiO2 -15 film is about 65μAcm−2, which is slightly higher than that obtained by Chen et al. for Ag NPs decorated TiO2 nanotubes with PEC measurements performed using the same electrolyte composition [32]. In order to explain the photoelectrochemical activity enhancement in Ag NPs loaded TiO2 films many mechanisms have been reported. Nishanthi et al. [34] suggested that the photocurrent density increase is attributed to the amelioration of electron-hole pairs separation efficiency. Silver NPs play the role of charge separation centers where photogenerated electrons are transferred to silver nanoparticles and therefore suppressing their recombination. This mechanism does not take into account the effect of visible light absorption amelioration, due to LSPR, on the PEC activity. Awazu et al. [41] have deposited TiO2 film on nanoparticles comprising Ag core covered with silica SiO2 shell (Ag@SiO2). Although no electronic transfer is possible between Ag and TiO2, the TiO2 coated Ag@SiO2 core-shell structure displayed an enhancement of methylene blue decomposition by a factor of 7 under near UV Irradiation. According to Awazu et al., the amelioration of the photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the delay of electron-hole pairs recombination owing to the enhancement of the electric field amplitude on the surface of Ag NPs due to the LSPR effect. In contrast with the mechanism suggested by S.T. Nishanthi et al., a different mechanism was reported by Tatsuma et al. [42], Chen et al. [32] and Jiao et al. [40] suggesting that the photocurrent density and photocatalytic enhancement in Ag and Au loaded TiO2 films can be attributed to the transfer of electrons from plasmonic photoexcited Ag NPs, upon irradiation by visible light, to the conduction band of TiO2. In this work, the enhancement of PEC response of Ag/PTiO2 films is attributed to both of their high specific surface area (due to their higher surface roughness compared with PTiO2 film) and to the plasmonic properties of Ag nanoparticles. For the plasmonic contribution, we suggest that the enhancement of the PEC response is attributed to a synergic effect of both of the local electric field enhancement in vicinity of Ag NPs and to the transfer of electrons from photoexcited Ag NPs to TiO2. Beside the charge carriers generated from TiO2 excited by the UV fraction present in the simulated solar light spectrum, the electric field amplitude enhancement on Ag NPs surface will not only delay the electron-hole pairs recombination [41], but it will also promote the generation of more electron-hole pairs in TiO2 [43]. Moreover, upon resonance with the incoming light at a particular frequency, a collective electron oscillation is created in silver nanoparticle surface (LSPR). Many of the oscillating electrons have a sufficient energy allowing their direct transfer to TiO2 conduction band and consequently increasing the photoelectrochemical response. Mubeen et al. [44] and Chen et al. [32] reported that electrons are transferred from Au and Ag NPs to TiO2 by quantum tunneling. However, Zhang et al. [43] suggested that the resort to the tunneling effect is not necessary to explain the transfer of electrons from Au NPs to TiO2 conduction band. In our case, the minimum value of the required exciting photon energy must be greater than the difference between the top bent of TiO2 conduction band Ecbb and silver Fermi level Ef (Fig. 9 ) which is equal to 0.55eV [38]. As mentioned in Section 3.3, the PTiO2-10 and PTiO2-15 samples present plasmon resonance peaks located at 400 and 483nm, respectively. The energy values of these wavelengths are much higher than 0.55eV and photoexcited electrons can easily be transferred from Ag to TiO2. Therefore, tunneling effect is not necessary to explain the electronic transfer from Ag to TiO2. Furthermore, PTiO2-15 film presents a higher PEC activity compared with PTiO2-10 which can be attributed to the higher visible light absorption in an extended range of the visible spectrum from 450 to 800nm. PTIO2-25 film displays a lower PEC response than both of PTiO2-10 and PTiO2-15, which can be explained by its lower absorption in the visible region compared with the two other samples and as a result a reduced number of electrons are being excited and transferred to TiO2 conduction band. Similar results were obtained by Chen et al. [32] and Nishanthi et al. [34] indicating a decrease in PEC response of Ag loaded TiO2 prepared with longer UV irradiation time. The PEC activity results are in well agreement with the UV–vis absorption spectra confirming that the PEC response enhancement is due to the plasmonic effect in Ag nanoparticles. 4 Conclusion Plasmonic Silver nanoparticles have successfully been deposited on porous Sol-Gel PTiO2 films by photodeposition technique with different UV irradiation times. Porous PTiO2 films can easily be prepared by adding PEG to the Sol-Gel starting solution. It was found that PTiO2 films present a higher photoelectrochemical response compared with TiO2 film. Ag loaded PTiO2 films exhibit an enhancement in visible light absorption due to the LSPR effect. The effect of UV irradiation time, during the Ag NPs photodeposition, on the PEC activity was investigated. It was found that Ag/PTiO2 films present a higher PEC activity compared with bare PTiO2 films. The highest PEC response was obtained for the sample with 15min of UV irradiation time. It was found that longer UV illumination will lead to a decrease in PEC activity. The photocurrent values of the Sol-Gel prepared Ag/PTiO2 films are comparable to those obtained for Ag NPs loaded TiO2 nanotubes elaborated with the relatively complex metallic Ti anodization technique.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.086,A camera calibration method based on plane mirror and vanishing point constraint,"Abstract In order to avoid a cumbersome calibration of camera parameters, a method of self-calibration using the imaging features of a plane mirror and the vanishing point pair constraint is proposed. A plane mirror and calibration template were placed at a certain angle and non-vertical geometric constraints were obtained from the calibration template, as well as from the virtual image of the calibration template. So all the internal parameters were calibrated at once. In order to reduce the influence on the calibration parameters of the vanishing point position, the least squares algorithm and the LM algorithm were used to optimize the parameters. Simulations and real experimental results show that the method has a high accuracy and robustness.",Feb-18," Keywords Machine vision Parameter calibration Vanishing point pair Plane mirror 1 Introduction Camera calibration is the process of solving for the model parameters of the camera according to a camera model, which is based on the image information of the feature points and the 3D spatial information. At present, there are many camera calibration methods [1], which can be divided into two types: traditional calibration methods and camera self-calibration methods. A traditional calibration method [2] gets the internal and external parameters under a certain camera model, based on specific experimental conditions, such as the shape and size of the calibration reference, which should be known. It has stricter requirements for its calibration reference and image coordinates. In 1992, Hartley [3] and Faugeras [4] first proposed the idea of camera self-calibration. This method only depends on the corresponding relationship between image and image of the surrounding environment during the movement process of the camera. Many scholars have researched this aspect, among which the vanishing point of orthogonal characteristic calibration method has become a research hotspot. Caprile [5], as well as Beardsley [6] first proposed a method to calibrate the camera by using the geometric characteristics of the vanishing points. Wang [7] uses three sets of lines and vanishing points to realize the camera calibration, but the method requires that these three sets of line segments be the same length as well as being mutually perpendicular in the calibration space; these calibration conditions are quite harsh. Chen et al. [8] calibrate the parameters using 4 vanishing points produced by a square to establish the vanishing line constraint equation, which is more sensitive to noise due to the need to solve the Kruppa equation. Huo [9] generates a pair of orthogonal vanishing points using two pairs of orthogonal parallel lines, and establishes the constraint equations with a relationship to the origin of the camera. There are other calibration methods using the orthogonal vanishing point [10–12] generated by rectangular, cylindrical, or a cube (long). As at least three images need to be taken in different positions to calibrate the camera parameters, it is quite cumbersome, whether moving the camera or moving the calibration template. In order to avoid the disadvantages of the traditional calibration method, a new calibration method is proposed based on the idea that the constraint equation can be used to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the intrinsic camera [13–16]. This method uses the principle of mirror reflection [17,18], puts the calibration template and plane mirror non-vertically, they only need to be located once, and there is just one shot: all parameters can be calibrated without moving the camera or the mirror. 2 Camera calibration model According to the pinhole model [19], as shown in Fig. 1 , the mapping relationship of spatial coordinates P(X W , Y W , Z W ) and pixel coordinates p(u, v)in the image coordinate system is (1) λ [ u v 1 ] = [ 1 / d x 0 u 0 0 1 / d y v 0 0 0 1 ] [ f 0 0 0 f 0 0 0 1 ] ( [ r 11 r 12 r 13 r 21 r 22 r 23 r 31 r 32 r 33 ] [ X W Y W Z W ] + [ t 1 t 2 t 3 ] ) = A [ R | T ] P W where (u 0, v 0) are the coordinates of the image centre, f/d x , f/d y are separately normalized focal lengths; A =[f/d x 0 u 0; 0 f/d y v 0; 0 0 1] are the intrinsic parameters of the camera; R is a rotation matrix, and T is a translation vector, which forms the external parameters of the camera. This formula describes the transformation of a point in space from the world coordinate system to the camera coordinate system, then to the image plane coordinate system, and then to the pixel coordinate system. 3 Calibration principle based on plane mirror and orthogonal vanishing point 3.1 Properties of orthogonal vanishing point In Euclidean space two parallel lines will intersect at infinity, without considering the distortion of the pinhole camera model: according to the theory of projective transformations, the two parallel lines projected to the imaging plane will intersect at one point, which is called the vanishing point – it is the projection of the point at infinity to the imaging plane. According to [20], the line connecting the camera’s optical centre and the vanishing point formed in the projection surface by the spatial parallel lines will be parallel to the spatial parallel lines (Fig. 2 ). For a square ABCD in space, the image in the imaging plane is a quadrilateral abcd. According to the principle of the vanishing point, the image of the parallel sides ab and cd intersect at the vanishing pointv 1, while bc and ad intersect at the vanishing point v 2. Then ov 1 ∥ AB ∥ CD and ov 2 ∥ AD ∥ BC，as AB ⊥ AD, and so ov 1 ⊥ ov 2. Here, v 1 and v 2 are a pair of orthogonal vanishing points: the line connecting these two points forms the vanishing lineL. Similarly, in the quadrilateralabcd, the extended line of diagonal ac and bd intersect with the vanishing line at op 1 and op 2, respectively，and the two points also form a pair of orthogonal vanishing points; we also have op 1 ⊥ op 2 (Fig. 3 ). From [21], if x 1 and x 2 are two vanishing points of any two points on two orthogonal lines L 1 and L 2 separately, then x 1 A −T A −1 x 2 =0, (A −1 x 1) T (A −1 x 2)=0. Now the two constraint equations for the camera’s internal parameters are obtained from the two vanishing points: (2) { v 1 A − T A − 1 v 2 = ( A − 1 v 1 ) T ( A − 1 v 2 ) = 0 p 1 A − T A − 1 p 2 = ( A − 1 p 1 ) T ( A − 1 p 2 ) = 0 3.2 Solution for the camera’s intrinsic parameters From above equation, for the two orthogonal vanishing point pairs v 1(u v1, v v1), v 2(u v2, v v2), the coordinates of the two vanishing points in the camera coordinate system are v 1 [ ( u v 1 − u 0 ) d x , ( v v 1 − v 0 ) d y , f ] , v 2 [ ( u v 2 − u 0 ) d x , ( v v 2 − v 0 ) d y , f ] . From Eq. (2), (3) { [ ( u v 1 − u 0 ) d x , ( v v 1 − v 0 ) d y , f ] T [ ( u v 2 − u 0 ) d x , ( v v 2 − v 0 ) d y , f ] = 0 [ ( u p 1 − u 0 ) d x , ( v p 1 − v 0 ) d y , f ] T [ ( u p 2 − u 0 ) d x , ( v p 2 − v 0 ) d y , f ] = 0 As there are 4 unknown parameters in these equations, it is necessary to have at least another two equations to solve. This means that another square is needed. Using the imaging characteristics of a plane mirror, we can get two images of the square (Fig. 4 ). In order to avoid the degradation of the vanishing point caused by the corresponding parallel edges of the object and the image, the plane of the square should not be perpendicular to the plane of the plane mirror. E.g., ABCD, A′ B′ C′ D′ corresponding to a vanishing point is v 2 ′, v 1 ′, p 2 ′, p 1 ′. Another set of constraint equations can be obtained from the orthogonal relation of the vanishing point pair above. The nonlinear equations are as follows: (4) [ ( u v 1 − u 0 ) ( u v 2 − u 0 ) ( v v 1 − v 0 ) ( v v 2 − v 0 ) 1 ( u p 1 − u 0 ) ( u p 2 − u 0 ) ( v p 1 − v 0 ) ( v p 2 − v 0 ) 1 ( u v ' 1 − u 0 ) ( u v ' 2 − u 0 ) ( v v ' 1 − v 0 ) ( v v ' 2 − v 0 ) 1 ( u p ' 1 − u 0 ) ( u p ' 2 − u 0 ) ( v p ' 1 − v 0 ) ( v p ' 2 − v 0 ) 1 ] [ ( d x / f ) 2 ( d y / f ) 2 1 ] = [ 0 0 0 0 ] The above equations are 4 equations for the parameters u 0, v 0, (dx/f)2, (dy/f)2. In order to solve this system of linear equations, set (5) x 1 = u 0 x 3 , x 2 = v 0 , x 3 = ( d x / d y ) 2 Subtracting the two corresponding equations yields (6) [ u v 1 + u v 2 − u p 1 − u p 2 v v 1 + v v 2 − v p 1 − v p 2 v p 1 v p 2 − v v 1 v v 2 u v 1 + u v 2 − u v ' 1 − u v ' 2 v v 1 + v v 2 − v v ' 1 − v v ' 2 v v ' 1 v v ' 2 − v v 1 v v 2 u v 1 + u v 2 − u p ' 1 − u p ' 2 v v 1 + v v 2 − v p ' 1 − v p ' 2 v p ' 1 v p ' 2 − v v 1 v v 2 ] [ x 1 x 2 x 3 ] = [ u v 1 u v 2 − u p 1 u p 2 u v 1 u v 2 − u v ' 1 u v ' 2 u v 1 u v 2 − u p ' 1 u p ' 2 ] Solving these equations forX =[x 1 x 2 x 3], then putting Xinto Eq. (4), f/dx and f/dy can be obtained. 4 Simulation experiment In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, simulation experiments were carried out on the MATLAB platform. Firstly, there was established the simulation camera model. Assume that the camera's internal parameters are u 0 =340, v 0 =270, f/dx =3000, f/dy =3000, and the image size of the calibration template is 1600*1200 pixels. The plane x =0 in three-dimensional space is defined as the plane of the plane mirror. The angle between the imaging plane and the plane mirror is 70°while the virtual image plane and the imaging plane are symmetrical about the plane mirror. R and T denote the rotation matrix and translation vector of the camera in the world coordinate system. R is represented by its rotation angle relative to the three coordinate axes: R =[0°,35°, 20°]. Along the direction of the axis, a counterclockwise rotation angle is positive. The translation vector T =[2500，2000，2500]. For a square in three-dimensional space, the left side of the coordinate system is virtual square, its spatial position and shape are shown as follows (Fig. 5 ). At each image point of the image plane, add a random white noise with an amplitude of 0∼2pixel, Then carry out 50 independent experiments at each noise level. The variation of the internal parameters at different noise levels are shown in Table 1 . The variation of the mean absolute error of the camera parameters with the noise is shown in Fig. 6 . The simulation results show that the trend of calibration error is increasing with an increase of noise level, which shows the correctness of the method. 5 Real experiment The calibration template uses a 6×6 chessboard, a grid size of 30mm×30mm, and a camera with a resolution of 1024 pixel×768 pixel to obtain the calibration template image. Then we selected 4 corners for the calibration target (A, B, C, D and their virtual images A’, B’, C’, D’ in Fig. 7 ) to calibrate (as shown in Fig. 7). The comparison of the calibration results obtained by the Matlab calibration toolbox and the method in this paper is shown in Table 2 . Because of its mature and stable calibration results, the calibration results from the Matlab Calibration Toolbox were taken as standard. In this paper, the error of the 4 point calibration method is larger: this is mainly due to the distortion of the imaging and the error of the corner detection [22]: the two parallel lines in the same direction are not parallel, and the position of the corresponding vanishing points is not accurate. So, we extracted multiple corner points from two pairs of edges and two diagonal directions, and then the least squares principle and Levenberg-Marquart algorithm were used to find the 4 optimal vanishing points in 4 directions (Fig. 8 ). For a number of corner points in a certain direction, linear equation fit through the least squares algorithm in this direction is (7) k ij u − v + b ij =0，i =1, 2..., n；j =1, 2, 3, 4; Where i denotes the number of corner points in the direction of a straight line, j denotes the direction of two pairs of parallel lines and the direction of the two vertical diagonals. Corresponding to group j of parallel lines, the vanishing point p's coordinates in the imaging plane isp(u, v)，and the optimal location of the vanishing point should minimize d, the sum of the distances between the vanishing point and the projection lines, so the optimization function is defined as follows: (8) F j = arg min ( ∑ i = 1 n d ( p ( u , v ) , l i j ( k i j , − 1 , b i j ) ) = arg min ( ∑ i = 1 n | k i j u − v + b i j | k i j 2 + 1 ) where d(p(u, v), l ij (k ij , −1, b ij )) represents the distance between the vanishing point and the linel ij . Taking the average of two projected points as the initial value for the iteration, we use the Levenberg–Marquart algorithm to carry out the optimization. In order to compare the results, this paper adopts the Matlab calibration toolbox, the Zhang-Zheng-You calibration method, the multiple image calibration method based on orthogonal vanishing points, and the method proposed in this paper, to calibrate parameters separately. The calibration results are shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that the calibration results from the method proposed in this paper has a certain gap with the results by the Matlab Calibration Toolbox, but is similar to the results of the multiple image calibration method. As this method does not need any precise calibration object coordinates, and can calibrate all internal parameters linearly by just one imaging, it is easy to operate and realize, and has a certain application value in situations of low precision and fast calibration. 6 Conclusions (1) Making full use of the orthogonality properties of lines connected by orthogonal vanishing points and the optical center, a square generates two constraint equations, which enables the avoidance of tediously and repeatedly shooting and operating: employing the characteristics of the plane mirror, the intrinsic parameters of the camera can be calculated with just one imaging, with the help of the flat mirror. (2) The proposed method based on a planar mirror and vanishing point constraints, is simple, convenient, and has lenient accuracy requirements for the calibration target. Simulations and real experiments show that the method has good accuracy and robustness. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.130,Research on SAD-PRD losses in semiconductor waveguide for application in photonic integrated circuits,"Abstract Scattering, absorption, diffraction, polarization, reflection and dispersion (SAD-PRD) losses in semiconductor waveguide at wavelength 1550nm is dissected in present research. Two types of semiconductor waveguides such as silicon-Air and GaAs-Air deal with the current work to increase the efficiency of photonic integrated circuit. The appraisal of aforementioned losses is divulged using disparate notion, for example; reflection loss is scrutinized by employing transfer matrix method (TMM) whereas Maxwell’s equation is deployed to disclose absorption loss. Further dispersion, diffraction, polarization and scattering losses are examined with the help of mathematical formulation. Eventually, the outcomes of the above investigation affirmed that the overall transmitted efficiency of Si-Air and GaAs-Air waveguide is more than 90% and 89% respectively pertaining to angle of deviation (−12° to 12°) from Bragg’s angle.",Feb-18," Keyword SOI Semiconductor waveguide SAD-PRD losses Grating structure 1 Introduction Silicon photonics has been acquired ample momentum over the preceding years owing to its superior properties. Silicon is considered to be a good candidate for designing optical waveguide because of its larger refractive index and its compatibility with the telecommunication windows of 1310nm and 1550nm [1,2]. Further Silicon based devices are evolving as the great platform for large scale integration of optical functions [3]. The semiconductor SOI waveguide structures find extensive application in designing several passive devices such as wavelength filters, multimode couplers and WDM filters [4–6]. In optical communication systems, SOI waveguide structure can be efficiently used as optical interconnector [7,8].Precise quantification of different sorts of losses in SOI waveguides play a vital for the design of efficient silicon photonic devices [9–11] and have gained extensive interest recently. The conventional waveguide agonizes from different losses such as reflectance, diffraction, polarization, scattering, dispersion that exists in the system. In optoelectronics device design, the above mentioned losses play a significant role and cannot be ignored. As far as different losses are considered, in reference [12] the author has given an experimental demonstration of silicon on insulator waveguide structure where the output transmitted efficiency is found to be 70% only. In reference [13], author proposed an efficient polymer grating SOI structure which is operated at 1550nm.But this is hard to fabricate because of presence of defects at different position in the polymer grating structure. In reference [14,15] author analysed reflectance, diffraction, absorption and polarization losses to maximise the transmitted efficiency. In addition to above losses, scattering and dispersion losses manipulate with serious problem during light transmission through photonics waveguide structures. This proposed work indicates semiconductor grating SOI structure in consideration of reflectance, diffraction, absorption and polarization losses along with scattering and dispersion to achieve high transmitted efficiency. This paper is prepared as follows: proposed grating SOI grating structure is reflected inspection where mathematical formulations is manipulated in Section 2.Simulation outcomes and interpretations are divulged in Section 4 and lastly conclusions are cited in Section 5. 2 Structural analysis Here we suggest an efficient semiconductor grating SOI structure shown in Fig. 1 . The above proposed structure is not new pertaining to recent work, because similar types of structures [16–22] have already used for sensing and communication applications using one dimensional grating structure. However the present work has bountiful newness as compared to previous work. Related works is made with the consideration of absorption and reflection only, where few other papers deals with similar types of works with the cogitation of absorption, reflection, diffraction only. Apart from this, little research also proposed similar types of structures with defect at grating structures. However, the present structure has some newness such as, (i) size of the structure is realized with nanometer scale which can be a suitable candidate for photonic integrated circuit. (ii) the manipulating wavelength is 1550nm, which is an operating signal in communication window(iii) there is no inclusion of defects, which leads to easy fabrication. Again analyzing Fig. 1, grating structure is developed on the oxide layer which is placed on the silicon substrate. Here we propose two different grating structures that consist of periodic arrangement of Si-Air and GaAs-Air respectively. Both the grating structures contain 25 numbers of layers. The odd layers are of semiconductor (Si/GaAs) and the even layers are of Air. The reason for choosing above semiconductor material is that absorption loss is nearly zero and can be neglected at the wavelength of 1550nm. However, other sorts of losses like reflection, diffraction, polarization, scattering and dispersion will be accomplished with the above said structure at the aforementioned wavelength. By choosing apposite thickness of odd and even layers of the grating structure, and by properly selecting the number of grating layers, we can minimize different losses, which are encountered problem during transportation of signal. It is also observed from the simulation results (which is discussed in Section 4) that reflectance loss is nearly zero for proper structural parameters. Finally, we obtained results for other losses such as diffraction,polarization, scattering and dispersion with respect to detuning Bragg’s angle −12° to 12° and found that these losses are to a greater extent below 10% for two grating structures. By combining all the aforementioned losses, we explore that the grating SOI structure bestow high transmission efficiency at wavelength 1550nm. 3 Mathematical treatment Due to adverse effect of different losses (reflection, absorption, diffraction, polarization, scattering, dispersion) on the efficiency of SOI grating structure, we in this paper have chosen appropriate structure parameters to eradicate these losses. Here the input signal to the grating structure is assumed to be a plane wave having constant frequency and lunched normal to the grating structure. Confining our analysis to single mode of propagation, we found reflectance of both Si-Air and GaAs-Air grating structure by using transfer matrix method [23] at wavelength 1550nm. To the extent absorption loss is concerned, it is found to be zero for the above semiconductor grating structures. Taking absorbance and reflectance into account, we develop a mathematical equation for computing efficiency [24] which is given by, (1) η 1 = ( 1 − R ) e − P β ( t 1 + t 2 ) Where, R: reflectance from the grating structure, P is the number of grating period, t1, t2: thickness of the odd and even layer respectively, β (4πk/λ) is absorption constant. For the above proposed grating structures, the value of k (i.e. extinction coefficient describing how strongly a material absorbs light for a given wavelength) is found to be zero at wavelength 1550nm [25]. Hence absorption loss is zero. The mathematical equation for diffraction loss is given by, (2) η 2 = sin 2 ( π n l λ c o s θ ) Where, l is a grating length=P(t1 +t2), n be an effective refractive index and θ is detuning Bragg’s angle. We also reported polarization efficiency and thereby polarization loss that varies as the polarization state of the travelling light wave changes. This loss consequences because of peak-to-peak difference in transmission of optical signal pertaining to all the possible state of polarization. We tried to minimize this loss in order to get maximum transmitted efficiency. The mathematical expression for polarization loss [26] is given as, (3) η 3 = N N + 2 n n 2 − 1 cos 2 ( θ ) Where, θ is the angle of deviation from Bragg’s angle, N be the total number of grating layers, n is the effective refractive index. Likewise, we have reported scattering loss, which mainly arises due to imperfection present in the material and surface irregularities. These imperfections may arise because of voids in the material or contaminant atoms [27,28]. Scattering loss employs severe limitations in attaining maximum transmitted efficiency, hence should be minimized. Scattering loss is given by, (4) η 4 = C ( 1 − R ) tan ( θ / d ) = C ( 1 − R ) / { d 1 + ( 2 nl / λ ) 2 } Where, R is reflectance, C is a constant (nearly equal to 1), l be the grating length, θ is the angle of deviation from Bragg’s angle. Lastly we found dispersion loss present in the grating SOI structure. Dispersion loss results due to different wavelength of light signal that enters the grating structure at one time and exit the structure at different times. Also variation of refractive index with respect to wavelength leads to dispersion loss [29]. Dispersion loss depends on the structure parameters and mathematically can be given by, (5) η 5 = 1.633 * sin 3 ( θ ) * N * n π * c 2 * l Where, N: total number of layers in semiconductor grating structure, n: effective refractive index, l: grating length is light velocity and θ is angle of deviation from Bragg’s angle. Bearing to above mentioned losses, overall transmitted efficiency can be determined by, (6) η=η1.η2. η3. η4. η5 4 Simulation results and interpretations Further memorizing proposed structure, we have considered two types of grating structures each consists of 25 number of layers, where the odd layers comprises(Si/GaAs) and even layers is made up of air. Different structural parameters(number of grating layers, thickness of each grating layers, refractive index) are carefully selected to achieve utmost transmitted efficiency and proposed parameters are listed in Table 1 . Cogitating mentioned values of Table 1, we carry out simulation for reflectance by using transfer matrix method(TMM) for both the grating structures. Interestingly we got some positive outcomes pertaining to same i.e. reflectance of 0.0003758 for Si-Air grating structure and 0.001621 for GaAs-Air grating structure at wavelength 1550nm, which are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) respectively. In the above figures, reflectance in Arbi.unit is plotted along vertical axis whereas wavelength in um is taken along horizontal axis. Though statement delivers jovial results with respect to transmitted efficiency, but diffraction loss is encountered serious problem. Thereafter, we performed simulation for diffraction efficiency by using Eq. (2) for both the considered grating structures with respect to the detuning from Bragg’s angle at wavelength of 1550nm. From Fig. 3 (a) and (b), it is observed that diffraction efficiency is 0.992(diffraction loss is 0.008) for Si-Air grating structure and 0.9925(diffraction loss is 0.0075) for GaAs-Air grating structure respectively. Like diffraction, a definite polarization loss exists with the same. We carried out simulation for polarization efficiency with respect to detuning from Bragg’s angle for both the grating structures at 1550nm by referring Eq. (3). Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows that, polarization efficiency is 0.9016(polarization loss of 0.0984) for Si-Air grating structure and 0.8972 (polarization loss of 0.1028) for GaAs-Air grating structure, for the incident angle lies in between −12° to 12°. From Fig. 4(a) and (b), it is inferred that polarization efficiency is maximum at 0° and gradually decreases with increase in detuning Bragg’s angle. After that, we made simulation for scattering loss for both the proposed and grating structures at 1550nm using Eq. (4). Fig. 5(a) and (b) represent scattering loss for Si-Air and GaAs-Air grating structures respectively. Here y- axis represents scattering loss in dB/nm and x-axis represents detuning from Bragg’s angle in radian. It is acquired that scattering loss is 0.002dB/nm for both the grating structures. Finally, we simulated both the proposed grating structures for calculation of dispersion loss at 1550nm. Fig 6(a) and (b) shows the curve for dispersion loss as a variation of detuning from Bragg’s angle. From the above figures, it is perceived that dispersion loss is zero within the Bragg’s angle −12° to 12°.At the end, we settled down to a conclusion that all kind of losses (reflection, absorption, diffraction, polarization, scattering, and dispersion) are suppressed to minimum value by properly selecting the structure parameters. Considering the above losses, transmitted efficiency is found to be 90.1% for Si-Air grating structure and 89.0% for GaAs-Air grating structure, which is a remarkable achievement. 5 Conclusions The core objective in this paper is to develop an effective Si-Air and GaAs-Air grating structures for application in photonic integrated circuit. Eqs. (1)–(5) are used to investigate different forms of losses like reflection, diffraction, polarization, scattering, dispersion respectively. It is noteworthy from the above equations that, different losses have strong dependence on the structure parameters. By properly choosing structure parameters, we computed reflectance by using transfer matrix method (TMM) at 1550nm wavelength, whereas other losses (reflection, diffraction, polarization, scattering, dispersion) are analysed with respect to detuning from Bragg’s angle −12° to 12°. Finally, considering all the aforementioned losses, overall transmitted efficiency is obtained. Excitingly, overall transmitted efficiency is attained to be 90.1% and 89.0% for Si-Air and GaAs-Air grating structures respectively at wavelength 1550nm. Hence the above structures came up as a good candidate as optical interconnector in photonics integrated circuits. "," [1] M. Loncar T. Doll J.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.052,Study of silicon films deposited by EB-PVD and the effect of applying annealing conditions on them,"Abstract This paper investigates structural, electronic, and optical silicon poly-crystalline coatings created in high vacuum condition (10−6 Torr) by Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EB-PVD). Samples were annealed after deposition in neutral gas environment of 800°C temperature. Results of microscopic images, micro Raman analysis and Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) showed that phase change happened from amorphous structure to crystalline structure in initial amorphous context which could be significantly enhanced by increasing annealing temperature. Aggregation and accumulation of silicon nano-crystals were also observed. Moreover, applying temperature of 800°C in one-hour resulted in complete crystallization and homogeneity of films. The situation caused the increase of SP2 SP3 bonds formed with more free electrons producing higher conductivity of electric film in the layers. Finally, because of increased density of film structure, light reflectance decreased from %12 to %3 due to poly-crystalline structure created in initial amorphous context.",Feb-18," Keywords Poly silicon Film Annealing Structure morphology Optical Electrical 1 Introduction Amorphous silicon coatings are considered as special substances in making electronic and optic devices because of the possibility of fundamental changes in different contexts and because they are physically and chemical neutral [1,2] and specially because applying coating by EB-PVD method is cheap in terms of expense and is industrial in terms of simplicity. As a semi-conductive substance from IV group, Silicon is used very often. It is also widely used in producing solar cells [3,4]. Silicon can exist in both crystalline and amorphous structures possessing different electronic and optical properties. Electronic and optical properties which greatly depend on the size of silicon nano-crystal created in amorphous phase are very different [5,6]. The EB-PVD method used for initial phase of forming amorphous silicon causes no chemical reaction. Materials are evaporated and placed on the surface for deposition by a high current from an electronic gun. The deposition process is achieved in very high vacuum (for example, less than 10−6 (Pa)) resulting in a higher degree of film purity and homogeneity in evaporation situation [7]. The heat inside the chamber is about 40°C which is very low and compared with PECVD process, it is still lower. This low heat removes undesired effects of unintended heating of the substrate. Moreover, substrate surface is less damaged from constituting atoms of film to which they are exposed. These are the strengths of this method compared with the spraying method which damages the substrate because of energy- loaded particles. As mentioned before, poly silicones are highly dependent on poly silicon structure. Grain boundaries and inter-granule defects are potential electric obstacles which prevent transporting of electric carriers inside poly silicon films. The reductions of the remaining inter-granule defects lead to creation of flawless areas less than 30nm. These very few defects can also act as limiting factors in the performance of intended systems [8,9]. Hence, decreasing inter-granular defects is very important in order to enhance electric and optical performances [10]. Also it is quite desired that poly silicon film with bigger grains and fewer inter-granular defects are produced. Recently, some techniques have been used to access optimal grain size to produce solid phase of crystallization (SPC) [11,12]. In annealing process, the solid phase of crystallization (SPC) is achieved and amorphous silicon changes trances into poly-crystal silicon in temperature below silicon melting point. SPC process in amorphous silicon phase happens because of the existence of less free energy (c-Si) compared with amorphous silicon in these contexts. So far, two methods of annealing in high temperature and applying ions have been proposed to reduce inter-granular defects [13,14]. The sources have reported that basic inter-granular defects in poly silicon films are micro twins which are unstable in a temperature higher than 750°C. Then, the deffects can be removed with higher temperature. Meanwhile, the process of increasing temperature cannot be used for some devices (such as Active-Matrix Liquid-Crystal Display AMLCD). These devices will go under physical changes if the temperature grows higher than a certain limit [15] because they have glass layers and because the layers have annealing stoop in temperature less than 650°C. Compared with annealing situation, ionic bombardment proves expensive and film homogeneity happens less in this context. Therefore, in this study, an annealing situation with controlled atmosphere was used to remove defects and formation of nano-crystals. In order to remove the problems of thermodynamic coating ionic bombardment was applied after annealing operations for the formation of substrate films of silicon wafer. Characterization was conducted through different mechanisms including field emission electronic microscope (FESEM), atomic force microscope, Micro Raman and Pico Ampere meter. In the final stage, the effects of annealing situations on structural, physical, chemical, electrical and optical parameters of the films were investigated. The objective of these studies was to access structures containing silicon nano-crystals which could improve suitable characteristics like electronic achievement in different thicknesses, accessing maximum absorption of light and reduction of light reflection despite physical and chemical stability. Therefore, to achieve that objective, finding a simple and low costing way which could be industrialized was very important. 2 Experiments Sampling was conducted with 8-in. silicon wafer of mono crystal type N (Czochralski). The samples were cleaned in two stages before deposition and were cut into specified sizes by humid-chemical method. First, a mixture of H2O: H2O2: NH4OH solvents with the ratio of 1: 5: 1: to 7: 2:1 suitable for removing organic pollutant. First, metal oxide particles and then other HCL: H2O2 H2O solvents with different volume ratios of 6: 1: 6: 1–8: 2: 1 were used. The process caused removal of alkalis remains and metallic hydroxides from wafer surface because wafer surface was exposed and therefore was covered with an oxide layer of 1–1.5nm thickness [16]. That’s why HF-DIP solvent was used for the last step of cleaning the samples. In this phase, surface silicon-hydrogen bonds were removed and the growth of inherent oxide was prevented [17]. After the preparation phase of silicon wafer, the films were placed in the Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) chamber for deposition-(Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)) – by Electron Beam System (EDS 160). In this system two 6-KW evaporators were used to carry out the silicon evaporation from Lanthanum source. Later, ordinary annealing of quartz type was used in order to separate the controlling samples for heat treatments to tube furnace. The samples were placed in a tube which could be heated up to 1400°C. Using a bar of quartz material, the samples were gently placed inside a furnace already heated. Annealing treatments were carried out in 800°C environment for one hour, and the samples were kept in 200°C temperature for 30min in Argon environment. Next, using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) made by VEECO in US the samples were analyzed for morphology characterization. Also, for analyzing the coating structure, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used. FE-SEM has a deeper field and higher resolution compared with normal field emission electron microscopy and by which we can take images at magnification of 700 thousand. In this work, we used the frame rate of 6.0459×10−6 and pixel size of 6 for produce of images. The system is produced by TESCAN Company in Check Republic. Using this microscope, an attempt was made to analyze the thickness of films. The declared thickness was confirmed by deposition system. To analyze structure, micro Raman spectroscopy was used, which changes in the range of wave number of 350–650 (cm−1) showing the transferring phase from amorphous silicon to crystalline silicon. Specially, the three states of Si clearly shown in terms of Raman-scattering change were determined by a Deconvolution process with three Gaussian peaks: amorphous phase (480cm−1) mediatory phase (510cm−1) caused by defective part of crystalline phase connected to grain boundaries, and crystalline phase caused by width light state from Si-Si vibrations in crystalline state. The following relations were used to calculate parameters like residual stress (δ), size of crystalline grain (DRAMAN) and crystalline particle (XC),: δ = − 0.25 ( I max − I 520 ) σ X C = I 520 I 520 + 1.255 × I 480 I 520 I 520 + 1.255 × I 480 D R A M A N = ( μ Δ γ ) Changes of electrical parameters were calculated through voltage current (IV) by Pico ampere meter CP13 made by Conical company in England. The device needs a generator and DC power and operates in range of 12×10−14 to FSD 1 1 Full-Scale Deflection. 12×10−3 in 23 different limits. The analyses of transmission and reflectance properties of light for films were conducted in a UV/VIS of SPECORD 210 spectrometer using a 5000 Cary system in room temperature. This system can present passing and reflective signals in wave length limits of 200–1000nm with 5nm resolution. 3 Discussion & results Figs. 1–4 show clearly the change from initial amorphous phase to crystalline structure and formation of polycrystalline structure in initial amorphous field. Regarding the figures, this phase can be divided for three groups. The first group includes samples of amorphous phase without annealing. The second group includes amorphous phase with very short nano-crystalline presence. The third group includes steady polycrystalline phase in which the amorphous phase reaches its possible lowest level. As shown in Fig. 3, micro Raman is shown in different temperatures for one hour. In Fig. 4 of XRD pattern, we see that initial amorphous structure of the film has changed because of the effect of annealing treatment. In Fig. 3, micro Raman images, the samples without annealing are in 483cm−1 range and the spreading of peak indicates amorphous structure [18]. However, applying heat treatment situations conducted in temperature higher than 500°C is created in form of Rapid Thermal Annealing. First, the peak is made in 510cm−1 indicating formation of a mixed structure from amorphous to crystalline structure while by increasing temperature to 800°C we observe skewing of the peak indicating the growth of crystals size which ultimately leads to their mixture and formation of bigger clusters. The results of micro Raman obtained from the comparison shown in Fig. 4 can be confirmed through severity of the amounts of crystalline growth. To calculate parameters like residual stress, size of crystalline grain, and crystalline particle the following relations were used, respectively [18]: Based on the relations mentioned in the experiments, the following table can be drawn. As shown in Table 1 , the results indicate that the amount of residual stress of the coating without annealing is in form of pressure while for annealing, they show that pulling stress is formed in film due to formation and presence of nano-crystals. As temperature increases, stress releases and pulling tension decreases. The amount of crystalline part in coatings without annealing is less than %3 while presence of small amount of crystalline grains is acceptable due to the defects of coating with increased thickness. However, by increasing annealing temperature, parameter Xc has increased and has reached close to %60 which is more suitable for industry and making optometric devices. Also, noticeable in these calculations is presence of highest peak in range of 500cm−1–510 in temperature of 600°C indicating formation of mediating structures between amorphous and crystalline ones. These structures are also known as defective structures [4]. On the other hand, based on the results obtained from Tables 1, 3 and 4, the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) in direction of [111] for samples under annealing it can be said that the size of average grain increases rapidly. As annealing temperature increases crystals growth reduces. We also witness more grains aggregation and formation of crystalline clusters so that in high-temperature conditions the number of nano-crystals is reduced while the growth process and aggregation of grains is completed and joining of clusters and formation of layers happens more often. Based on tables II, presence of created nano-crystals in the samples causes reduction of FWHM which, in turn, improves film quality on silicon substrate on whose base we can calculate optimized annealing treatments given in the following table (Table 2 ). As shown in the results, when annealing temperature increases the amount of FWHM decreases while peak intensity increases. The important point here is that we can calculate the optimized thermodynamic situations based on Arnius relation because incubation layer depends on the process of grain growth and grains aggregation and also due to the relation of parameters to annealing temperature. These conditions are necessary for the calculation of incubation layer, common energy, and Gibbs free energy, and these, in turn, are required for the formation of critical grains. τ = τ o . exp ( Q T K T ) The amount of 1.44 for the experimental samples equals FWHM changes of slope curve. We can say that applying 800°C temperature in one hour time leads to completion of crystallization and film homogeneity verifiable by images of cross sectioning of the samples. As shown in the figure of changes and the amount of defect in samples with different degrees of crystallization, phase transformation happens between amorphous phase and silicon crystalline phase which, in turn, removes or reduces the structural defects of coating of amorphous samples affected by heat treatment (Fig. 5 ). Morphology changes shown in Fig. 6 play a very important role in clarifying the importance of the transformation area between amorphous and crystalline structures. It was already shown that crystalline grains in films which have obtained nano-crystals under different conditions are surrounded by amorphous texture which is very effective in deactivation of grain boundaries and which, in turn, affects many optical and electrical applications. On the other hand, when crystalline ratio is very low and the amount of amorphous phase is very high, the amount of defects would increase in these structures, too. Then, applying situations of heat treatment in longer cycles and higher temperatures leads to degradation of such films. As shown in Fig. 3, in addition to peaks indicating the ranges 520, 510, and 480cm−1, there are other peaks in ranges (limits) of 1150cm−1, 1342 and 1511–1598 although they are negligible. These peaks are related to the formation of sp2 and sp3 respectively which indicate properties of electrical coatings. The amounts are given in Table 3. The increase of sp2 and sp3 bonds in films containing silicon nano- crystals means more free electrons and therefore higher electrical conductivity in layers. In analyzing these amounts two points are very important. First, applying heat treatment in all three thicknesses of the study leads to the increase of the severity of Raman status which introduces higher electrical conductivity. Second, we witness the very high increase of this parameter in high thicknesses (500nm) at annealing which cannot be observed for thicknesses less than 300nm. The samples under heat treatment of annealing in properties I–V showed significant improvement after thermal annealing. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 7 and the proportionate change in electrical properties has been given in Table 4. Table 4 shows that we have significant increase of electrical conductivity as we increase thickness under similar annealing conditions. In fact, thermal annealing can create a structure without stress by removing some weak bonds, which is also considered as an improvement in electrical conductivity of coating. As mentioned before, presence of nano-crystals is very important in optical behavior of films. The effect can be seen in spectrums shown in Fig. 8 . As seen in Fig. 8, there is generally a decrease in the amount of reflectance parameter so that by applying annealing situations especially in 800°C temperature, light absorption is in its highest level and reduction of reflectance is observable. This is due to the increase in structural density in coating caused by formation of poly crystalline structure in initial amorphous context, in a way that in thickness of 500nm this change has decreased from %12 before annealing to %3 after the annealing. The decrease indicates structural density and reflectance reduction which are shown with dark lines in the table. 4 Conclusion In this study, light microscopes, electron microscopes, and analysis of GIXRD and UV–vis Spectroscopy micro Raman spectrums were used in order to analyze the amorphous structure of films created on silicon wafer substrate. The created films were investigated under different thermal annealing treatments in a controlled environment to create the phase of transportation process and formation of poly crystals. The results indicated that in thermal treatments under 600°C in Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA) conditions, presence of silicon nano-crystals in initial amorphous context was very slight which in 500-nm thicknesses could also be seen because of structural defects of the coating at the time of its formation. The increased sp2 and sp3 bonds due to annealing caused increased electrical conductivity which was significantly enhanced because the thickness had already increased. Light reflectance was also significantly reduced because of the density of coating texture for different annealing treatments. "," [1] P.A. Dmitriev S.V. Makarov V.A.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.09.122,Band-Gap tuning of graphene by dual AuCl3-Acceptor and N-Donor doping: A first principle study,"Abstract Graphenes dual-doped by AuCl3-acceptor and N-donor have been investigated using the first principle calculations. The band gaps of the dual-doped graphenes are opened. Three supercell models of dual-doped graphenes were calculated for comparison. With the increasing of N-AuCl3 distance, the band-gap width of graphene decreases, but the work function and the formation energy (E form) of graphene increases. We suggest the changes of band-gap width and Fermi level are attributed to the charge redistribution between N, AuCl3 and graphene. The change of E form is originated from the variations of L CN(Å) and L CC(Å) caused by the interaction between AuCl3 and graphene layer.",Feb-18," Keywords Graphene Band-Gap tuning N-AuCl3 dual doping First-principles 1 Introduction Graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer structure of carbon, has attracted intense attention since its first successful preparation in 2004 [1]. Graphene has been widely used in many applications such as solar cells [2], composites [3–5], field emission sources and vacuum electronic devices [6,7]. In these areas, graphene shows interesting optical and electrical properties such as high transmittance，high surface area, strong electrical conductivity, easy to modify and mass production [8–11]. Through exploring the band structure of graphene, it is possible to get a deeper understanding and more rational use of the special optical and electrical properties of graphene. Thus, the band gap opening of graphene becomes an interesting work. Researchers have studied the methods to open the band gap of graphene, such as single-doping [12] or dual-doping with donors and acceptors [13,14], molecule absorbing [15,16], and B-N embedding [17–19]. Dual-doping with donors and acceptors is a good way to open the band gap of graphene. Especially, B-N dual doping has been investigated by many researchers, because the radii of B and N atom are similar with that of C atom. However, B acceptors and N donors are both substitutional defects. Dual doping with high concentration may strongly degrade the lattice integrity of graphene and decrease the electrical properties such as carrier mobility [13,14]. AuCl3 is an acceptor-like molecule for graphene and does not substitute the C atoms, because the Au3+ ions can be reduced to Au clusters through a charge transfer from the graphene surface [20–22]. Thus, the N-AuCl3 dual doping may provide a way to open the band gap of graphene with less substitutional defects. However, to our best knowledge, so far there has few calculation studies on the band-gap tuning of graphene by N-AuCl3 dual doping. In this paper, the band-gap tuning of graphene by AuCl3-acceptor and N-donor dual doping were studied using the first-principle calculations. Results show that the band-gaps of graphenes are successfully opened. Three supercell models of dual-doped graphenes were calculated for comparison. The band structures, the density of states (DOS), the partial density of states (PDOS), the formation energies (E form) and the charge densities difference of the three supercell models were comprehensively investigated. 2 Models and methods All the calculations were performed by CASTEP package based on density functional theory and all the models have been optimized successfully. We chose the projector augmented wave method (PAW) [23] to signify electron-ionic core interaction. Using Perdew Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) [24] of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to treat the electron exchange and correlation. We build 7×7×1 supercells of pristine and dual-doped graphenes. Each supercell has 98 carbon atoms. In the dual-doped graphene system, a carbon atom was substituted by a nitrogen atom and then an AuCl3 molecule was adsorbed on the surface of graphene. A vacuum layer with a thickness of 20Å was set to keep the adjacent graphene layers without interaction. In Fig. 1 , in order to study the effect of Au-N distances on the graphene electronic properties, we constructed three supercell models with different Au-N distances for comparison. The Au-N distances for model A, B and C were 3.757, 5.561 and 6.731Å, respectively. The cutoff energy of the plane wave was set to be 350eV, and k-point meshes with a reciprocal space resolution of 2π×0.03Å−1 were used for Brillouin zone sampling to ensure the error bars of the total energies were less than 1 meV/atom. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows the calculated band structures of doped graphenes. The band-gap width of pristine graphene is zero [25,26]. As for the doped graphenes, the conduction band minimums are higher in energy than the corresponding valence band maximums, which indicates the band-gaps successfully opened by the N-AuCl3 dual doping. The Fermi level of model A is in the band-gap, which is similar with previous study for graphene by B and N doping [27]. However, the Fermi levels of model B and C are in the valence band, which suggests the effective charge transfer for AuCl3 is larger than that for N atoms. The calculated band-gap values for model A, B and C are listed in Table 1 . The d Au-N values are the distances between N and Au atoms. Clearly, the band-gap width of graphene decreases with the increasing of N-AuCl3 distance. Model A has the largest band-gap width (0.398eV) with the smallest N-AuCl3 distance of 3.757Å. Fig. 3 shows the density of states (DOS) of graphenes. DOS for pristine graphene at the Fermi level is very small [25,26,28]. Compared with the band structure of pristine graphene, the band-gap opening is observed in the DOS map. It is obvious that band-gap of graphene decreases with the increasing of N-AuCl3 distance. In order to further understand the electronic properties of dual-doped graphenes, the partial density of states (PDOS) were calculated. And the calculated results show that the three models have similar PDOS spectra. In Fig. 4 , we give a representative PDOS of model A. Hybridizations between Au-d and Cl-p states, which located at −5eV, −1.85eV and −0.6eV, were observed [29]. Similarly, hybridizations also appear between p orbitals of C atoms and the p orbitals of N atom. Fig. 4 also indicates the DOS peaks near the Fermi level are mainly dominated by the AuCl3 molecule. Thus, the interaction between AuCl3 molecule and graphene layer enhances with the increasing of N-AuCl3 distance. The formation energy (E form) is important for doping efficiency and stability. We have calculated the E form of the dual-doped graphenes, which is defined as: (1) E form = E doped − E pure − E N- E AuCl3 + E C where E doped, E pure, E N, E AuCl3 and E C are total energies of the doped graphene, the pristine graphene, the isolated N atom, the AuCl3 molecule and the isolated C atom, respectively. The calculated E form, L CN and L CC of the doped graphenes are shown in Table 2 . It is obvious that the E form increases with the increasing of d Au-N. Model A with the smallest d Au-N of 3.757Å has the lowest E form of 0.4547eV, due to the average L CN and L CC increase with the increasing of d Au-N. The change of E form is mainly originated from the variations of the average L CN and L CC caused by the interaction between AuCl3 and graphene layer. In order to further understand the Fermi level shift caused by d Au-N, the charge densities difference of the model A and C are calculated, shown in Fig. 5 . Here in, the electronic charge density difference as a two-dimensional (2D) plane was studied. The (110) plane crossing two C atoms and one N atom is selected to estimate the charge variation of graphene plane. It can be seen from the figure that there is no transfer of charge between graphene and AuCl3 molecules, therefore the interaction of them is Van der Waals force, and belongs to physical adsorption.It is known that the information of charge redistribution is mainly based on the shift of Fermi level [30] and the charge redistribution usually shifts the Fermi level [31]. Comparing model C with model A, we find that the change in charge around gold atoms indicates that the interaction between gold atoms and chlorine atoms is weakened and that the effect of AuCl3 molecules on graphene layers is enhanced, thus making the graphene layers charge redistribution, leading to Fermi level into the valence band. 4 Conclusions In summary, three supercell models (dual-doped graphenes with different d Au-N) were calculated based on the density functional theory method. The band structures, DOS, PDOS, E form and electronic charge densities difference were studied. Our results show that the band-gaps of the graphenes were successfully opened by AuCl3 N dual-doping. With the increasing of d Au-N, the band-gap width of graphene decreases, however, the work function and E form of graphene increase. The dual-doped graphene with the smallest d Au-N of 3.757Å shows a largest band-gap width of 0.398eV and a lowest E form of 0.4547eV. The changes of band-gap width and Fermi level are attributed to the charge change between N, AuCl3 and graphene. The change of the E form is originated from the variations of LCN and LCC caused by the interaction between AuCl3 and graphene.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.041,A simplified modal expansion formalism adapted to the optical design of resonant cavity enhanced photodetectors using metallic gratings,"Abstract In this communication, we present a method to model the light absorption in a resonant photoconductor based on a photoconductive layer sandwiched between a metallic grating in front side and a metallic backside mirror. We started from a modal expansion formalism previously developed in order to model the transmission and the reflection of an infinite array of holes and we added the effect of a stack of homogeneous layers ended by a metallic mirror. It is finally shown that the electromagnetic response of the structure calculated with this numerical method is in good agreement with a more rigorous method such as the rigorous coupled wave analysis, whereas it requires a much lower computing power.",Feb-18," MSC 00-01 99-00 Keywords Ultrafast photodetector Modal expansion analysis Diffraction gratings 1 Introduction Ultrafast photodetectors are key devices for the generation and the detection of THz waves based on the laser and optoelectronics technologies [1,2]. As far as now, the devices which present suitable properties for these applications, i.e. a THz frequency bandwidth and a high saturation photocurrent, are uni-travelling carrier photodiodes [3] (UTC-PD) pumped by 1550 nm lasers and ultrafast photoconductors based on photoconductive materials presenting sub-picosecond carrier life time. This second class of devices is dominated by THz photoconductors using GaAs epitaxial layers grown at low temperature (200°C) [4] and pumped by 780-nm-lasers [5]. Last years, it has been shown that their properties could be greatly improved by using resonant optical cavities in which metallic layers serve in the same time as bias electrodes and mirrors of the cavity [6,7]. Concerning the THz photoconductors, the optical cavity allows for reducing the thickness of the absorption layer while keeping constant the quantum efficiency (defined here as the ratio of the number of charge carrier generated in the device to the number of incident photons by unit of time) resulting in an increase of the photoresponse. This concept can also be adapted to the UTC-PD in order to reduce the thickness of the p-doped absorbing layer, and then improve the frequency bandwidth without loss in quantum efficiency. The front mirror of the optical cavity is semi-transparent and consisted of a thin (20nm) gold layer in the first attempts [6], however this solution suffers from some drawbacks such as high optical losses and high sheet electrical resistivities. In a second step, front mirrors consisting of a one dimensional array of slits has been considered, allowing for a better transmission and a lower effective sheet electrical resistivity [8]. In this work, we present a simplified modal expansion formalism (SMEF) based on the work of De Leon-Perez and co-workers [9,10], in order to design such an optical cavity which needs a very low computing power as compared with more standard methods such as the rigorous coupled wave method. The SMEF is similar to a coupled mode analysis [11], but with some simplification coming from the use of waveguide modes in the slits patterned in the metallic sheet. Here, in a first part, we will remind the method as presented by De Leon-Perez and coworkers with the addition of some missing steps. In a second part we will present the additional steps allowing for modeling model not only a metallic grating, but a also Fabry-Prot cavity based on such a grating. 2 Scattering of light by an array of metallic holes In this first part, we are going to remind the main steps of the SMEF method as presented in Ref. [9] allowing for the calculation of the electromagnetic response of an infinite two-dimensional array to an incident plane wave. The array is assumed to be in the x–y plane and has a finite thickness h, as we can see in Fig. 1 . The lattice parameters are L x and L y . The analysis is performed by using the CGS system and only the transverse components of the electric field E and magnetic field H , which are used in the boundary conditions at the interface between different media, are taking into account. The dirac notation is used, such that 〈 r ∥| E 〉= E ( r ∥)=(E x ( r ∥), E y ( r ∥)) t where t stand for transposition and r ∥ =(x, y). Regions I and III are dielectric semi-spaces characterized by the real dielectric constant ϵ 1 and ϵ 3, respectively. Region II represents the corrugated metal film with a wavelength-dependent dielectric function ϵ m . We assume that the system is illuminated by an incident wave coming from region I. We expand the EM fields on the eigenmodes of each region, and match them at the boundaries. In region I, the fields are expanded into an infinite set of plane waves with parallel wavevector k ∥ =(k x , k y ) and polarization σ. The incident radiation is labeled by the superscript 0. The fields can be written in terms of reflection amplitude ρ k ∥σ as (1) | E I ⟩ = e i k z 0 z | k ∥ 0 σ 0 ⟩ + Σ k σ ρ k ∥ σ e - i k z z | k ∥ σ ⟩ (2) | - u z × H I ⟩ = Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 e i k z 0 z | k ∥ 0 σ 0 ⟩ - Σ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ρ k ∥ σ e - i k z z | k ∥ σ ⟩ where u z is the unitary vector along the z-direction and the summation runs over parallel wavevectors such as k ∥ = k ∥ 0 + K R , K R being a vector of the reciprocal lattice. The real space representation of the plane waves is given by 〈 r ∥ | k ∥ σ 〉 = exp ( i k ∥ · r ) k ∥ L x L y ( k x , k y ) t , p − polarization ( − k y , k x ) t , s − polarization where we assume a ∥ k ∥ σ ⟩ independent normalization 〈 k ∥ σ| k ∥ σ〉=1. The electric and magnetic field are related through the admittance Y k ∥p = k ω ϵ 1/k z and Y k ∥s = k z /k ω where k ω =2π/λ 0 (λ 0 is the free space wavelength of the incident radiation, and k ∥ 2 + k z 2 = ϵ 1 k ω 2 (see Appendix A for further details). 2.1 Expansion of the fields in the 3 regions We have already seen in Eq. (1) the expansion on a basis of plane waves in the region I. In this first part, we assume that the Region III (z ≥ h) is semi-infinite, so the EM fields can also be expanded in plane waves and expressed in terms of transmission amplitudes t k ∥σ : (3) | E III ⟩ = Σ k σ t k ∥ σ e i k z ′ ( z - h ) | k ∥ σ ⟩ (4) | - u z × H III ⟩ = Σ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ′ t k ∥ σ e i k z ′ ( z - h ) | k ∥ σ ⟩ Now, we are going to expand the EM fields in Region II on a waveguide modes basis corresponding to the geometry of the holes. Noting |α〉 a certain waveguide mode, and C α and D α the expansion coefficient, we can write: (5) | E II ⟩ = Σ α ( C α e i k α z z + D α e - i k α z z ) | α ⟩ (6) | - u z × H II ⟩ = Σ α Y α ( C α e i k α z z - D α e - i k α z z ) | α ⟩ where Y α = k ω ϵ 2/k αz and Y α = k αz /k ω for TE and TM modes respectively. 2.2 Application of the boundary conditions at each region interface Following Ref. [9], we use a crude approximation in order to take into account the real properties of the metal sheet forming the grating. It establishes the following relation between the tangential components of the EM fields at the horizontal interface: E = z s H × u n , where u n is the vector normal to the surface and pointing to the interior of the metal and z s = 1 / ϵ M . This continuity equation must be satisfied at each interface. In Region I u n = u z and the continuity equation gives: (7) z s H × u z = z s H x z s H y z s H z × 0 0 1 = z s H y - z s H x 0 = z s Y k ∥ σ · E x E y 0 2.2.1 Continuity of the electric field in z =0 In z =0 and with the dirac notations, it gives: (8) | E I 〉 = z s Y k ∥ σ | E I 〉 ⇔ (9) | k ∥ 0 σ 0 ⟩ + Σ k σ ρ k ∥ σ | k ∥ σ ⟩ = z s Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 | k ∥ 0 σ 0 ⟩ - Σ k ∥ σ z s Y k ∥ σ ρ k ∥ σ | k ∥ σ ⟩ Now, if we project on the plane waves basis 〈 k ∥ σ|, we obtain: (10) δ k ∥ , k ∥ 0 δ σ , σ 0 + ρ k ∥ σ = z s Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 δ k ∥ , k ∥ 0 δ σ , σ 0 − z s Y k ∥ σ ρ k ∥ σ In Region II, in z =0+, with also u n = u z , it gives (11) Σ α ( C α + D α ) | α ⟩ = Σ α z s Y α ( C α - D α ) | α ⟩ And once projected on the 〈 k ∥ σ| basis: (12) Σ α ( C α + D α ) 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 = Σ α z s Y α ( C α − D α ) 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 If we have the continuity of the Electric Field in z =0, we must equalize both terms of Eqs. (10) and (12). Then it gives: (13) Σ α ( C α + D α 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 = δ k ∥ , k ∥ 0 δ σ , σ 0 + ρ k ∥ σ (14) Σ α z s Y α ( C α − D α ) 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 = z s Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 δ k ∥ , k 0 δ σ , σ 0 − z s Y k ∥ σ ρ k ∥ σ (13) and (14) gives: (15) Σ α 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 E α = δ k ∥ , k ∥ 0 δ σ , σ 0 ( 1 − z s Y k ∥ σ ) + ρ k ∥ σ ( 1 + z s Y k ∥ σ ) ⇔ (16) ρ k ∥ σ = 1 f k ∥ σ + Σ α 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 E α − f k ∥ σ − f k ∥ σ + δ k ∥ , k ∥ 0 δ σ , σ 0 where E α = C α f α − + D α f α + and f α ± = 1 ± z s Y α . 2.2.2 Continuity of the electric field in z = h In z = h −, u n =− u z and we have: (17) Σ α ( C α e i k α z h + D α e - i k α z h ) | α ⟩ = - Σ α z s Y α ( C α e i k α z h - D α e - i k α z h ) | α ⟩ In z = h +, (18) Σ k ∥ σ t k ∥ σ | k ∥ σ ⟩ = - Σ k ∥ σ z s Y k ∥ σ ′ t k ∥ σ | k ∥ σ ⟩ Once projected on the 〈 k ∥ σ|, (18) and (17) gives: (19) t k ∥ σ − Σ α ( C α e i k α z h + D α e − i k α z h ) 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 = − z s Y k ∥ σ ′ t k ∥ σ + Σ α z s Y α ( C α e i k α z h − D α e − i k α z h ) 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 ⇔ (20) t k ∥ σ = − 1 f k ∥ σ ′ + Σ α 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 E α ′ where E α ′ = − C α f α + e i k α z h − D α f α − e − i k α z h . 2.2.3 Continuity of the magnetic field Let us now impose the continuity of the tangential component of the magnetic field which has to be fulfill only in the slits. This is done by projecting the fields on the |α〉 basis. In z =0, we obtain: (21) Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 | k ∥ 0 σ 0 ⟩ - Σ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ρ k ∥ σ | k ∥ σ ⟩ = Σ α Y α ( C α - D α ) | α ⟩ and once projected in the |α〉, it becomes: (22) Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 ⟨ α | k ∥ 0 σ 0 ⟩ - Σ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ρ k ∥ σ ⟨ α | k ∥ σ ⟩ = Y α ( C α - D α ) In z = h, once projected on |α〉 we obtain: (23) Σ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ' t k ∥ σ ⟨ α | k ∥ σ ⟩ = Y α ( C α e i k α z h - D α e - i k α z h ) If we put the expressions of ρ k∥σ and t k∥σ given in Eqs. (16) and (20) in theses expressions, we obtain for Eq. (22): (24) Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 〈 α | k ∥ 0 σ 0 〉 − ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ 1 f k ∥ σ + ∑ β 〈 k ∥ σ | β 〉 E β − f k ∥ σ − f k ∥ σ + δ k ∥ , k ∥ 0 δ σ , σ 0 〈 α | k ∥ σ 〉 = Y α ( C α − D α ) ⇔ (25) 〈 α | k ∥ 0 σ 0 〉 Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 1 + f k ∥ σ − f k ∥ σ + − ∑ β ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ f k ∥ σ + 〈 k ∥ σ | β 〉 〈 α | k ∥ σ 〉 E β = Y α ( C α − D α ) ⇔ (26) I α − ∑ β ≠ α G α β E β − G α α E α = Y α ( C α − D α ) where G α β = ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ f k ∥ σ + 〈 α | k ∥ σ 〉 〈 k ∥ σ | β 〉 and I α = 2 Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 f k ∥ 0 σ + 〈 α | k ∥ 0 σ 0 〉 . Now, let's show that Y α ( C α − D α ) = − Σ α E α − G α V E α ′ where (27) Σ α = Y α f α + e i k α z h + f α − e − i k α z h f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h (28) G α V = 2 Y α f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h (29) − Σ α E α − G α V E α ′ = − Y α C α e i k α z h ( f α + f α − − 2 f α + ) + C α e − i k α z h f α − 2 f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h − Y α D α e − i k α z h ( f α + f α − − 2 f α − ) + D α e i k α z h f α + 2 f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h (30) − Σ α E α − G α V E α ′ = − Y α C α e − i k α z h f α − 2 − C α f α 2 + e i k α z h f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h − Y α D α e i k α z h f α + 2 − D α f α 2 − e − i k α z h f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h = Y α ( C α − D α ) We have used in the previous equation (31) f α + f α − − 2 f α + = f α + ( f α − − 2 ) = ( 1 + z s Y α ) ( 1 − z s Y α − 2 ) = ( 1 + z s Y α ) ( − 1 − z s Y α ) = − f α 2 + Concerning the second continuity equation (23), we obtain straightly: (32) ∑ γ ≠ ν G γ ν ′ E ν ′ + G γ γ ′ E γ ′ = − Y γ ( C γ e i k γ z h − D α e − i k γ z h ) It remains to prove that Σ γ E γ ′ + G γ V E γ = − Y γ ( C γ e i k γ z h − D γ e − i k γ z h ) Σ α E α ′ + G α V E α = Y α f α + e i k α z h + f α − e − i k α z h − C α f α + e i k α z h − D α f α − e − i k α z h f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h + 2 Y α C α + D α f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h Σ α E α ′ + G α V E α = Y α − C α f α 2 + e 2 i k α z h − D α f α 2 − e − 2 i k α z h + C α ( 2 f α − − f α − f α + ) + D α ( 2 f α + − f α − f α + ) f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h = Y α C α [ f α − 2 − f α + 2 e 2 i k α z h ] + D α [ f α + 2 − f α − 2 e − 2 i k α z h ] f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h = Y α C α e i k α z h [ f α − 2 e − i k α z h − f α + 2 e i k α z h ] + D α e − i k α z h [ f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e 2 i k α z h ] f α + 2 e i k α z h − f α − 2 e − i k α z h = − Y α ( C α e i k α z h − D α e − i k α z h ) As in [9], we obtain eventually the set of coupled equations for E α and E α ′ which are essentially the modal amplitudes of the electric field at the input and output interfaces of the holes, respectively: (33) ( G α α − Σ α ) E α + ∑ β ≠ α G α β E β − G α V E α ′ = I α (34) ( G γ γ ′ − Σ γ ) E γ ′ + ∑ ν ≠ γ G γ ν ′ E ν ′ − G γ V E γ = 0 Once E α and E α ′ are known, all the other quantities can be calculated. 3 Scattering on a 1D periodic array of infinite slits 3.1 With only the TM 0 mode of the slit taken into account The problem is greatly simplified in the case of an array of infinite slits with a period p = L x and a width a perpendicular to the incidence plane ( x z plane, i.e. k∥ = k x x as seen in 2 ) of a p-polarized plane wave, if we consider only the TM 0 in the slit, we obtain: | α = 0 ⟩ = 1 a ( 1 0 ) t if | x | ≤ a / 2 0 if | x | > a / 2 The normalization factor ensures that 〈 0 | 0 〉 = ∫ x = − L x / 2 x = L x / 2 1 a dx = 1 . Furthermore, by considering that the metal is perfect along the slit, we can assume that k 0z = k ω . So, it is now possible to evaluate easily the overlap integral G 00 in the case of p-polarized incident wave because: 〈 0 | k ∥ σ 〉 = ( 1 0 ) ( k x 0 ) t 1 k x a p ∫ x = − p / 2 x = p / 2 exp ( i k x x ) dx = 1 a p exp ( i k x a / 2 ) − exp ( − i k x a / 2 ) i k x = a p sin k x a 2 k x a 2 And then G 00 = ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ f k ∥ σ + | 〈 0 | k ∥ σ 〉 | 2 = ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ f k ∥ σ + a p sin 2 k x a 2 k x a 2 2 Here the metallic sheet is assumed to be a perfect electric conductor allowing for an analytical expression of the overlap integration. Nevertheless it is possible to use a first order correction to improve the accuracy of the model [12] According the Bloch theorem, the sum runs over k ∥ = k x x where k x = k x 0 + n 2 π p , n being an integer. The system of equations to be solved becomes: (35) ( G 00 − Σ 0 ) E 0 − G 0 V E 0 ′ = I 0 (36) ( G 00 ′ − Σ 0 ) E 0 ′ − G 0 V E 0 = 0 where G 00 = ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ f k ∥ σ + a p sin 2 k x a 2 ( k x a 2 ) 2 I 0 = 2 a p Y k ∥ 0 σ 0 f k ∥ 0 σ + sin k x 0 a 2 k x 0 a 2 Σ 0 = Y 0 f 0 + e i k 0 z h + f 0 − e − i k 0 z h f 0 + 2 e i k 0 z h − f 0 − 2 e − i k 0 z h G 0 V = 2 Y 0 f 0 + 2 e i k 0 z h − f 0 − 2 e − i k 0 z h The solution of this set of equation is: E 0 ′ = I 0 G 0 V / D and E 0 = ( G 00 ′ − Σ 0 ) / D , where D = ( G 00 − Σ 0 ) ( G 00 ′ − Σ 0 ) − ( G 0 V ) 2 . Once E 0 ′ and E 0 are obtained, we can calculate the transmission t k ∥ p and reflection coefficients ρ k ∥p f or each diffracted order and then the transmitted and reflected power are given by: T = ∑ k ∥ p propag Y k ∥ p ′ | t k ∥ p | 2 R = ∑ k ∥ p propag Y k ∥ p | ρ k ∥ p | 2 propag indicates that only the propagative plane waves solutions should be taken into account. 3.2 With the TM 0 and the TM 1 modes of the slit taken into account When the width of the slit becomes close to λ/2, the second TM 1 mode in the slit has to be also taken into account. This mode is noted here |α =1〉 and is defined as follows, if we consider perfect metal walls: | α = 1 ⟩ = 2 a sin ( π a x ) ( 1 0 ) t if | x | ≤ a / 2 0 if | x | > a / 2 The normalization factor ensures that 〈 1 | 1 〉 = ∫ x = − L x / 2 x = L x / 2 2 a sin 2 π a x dx = 1 . Furthermore, k 1 z = k ω 2 − ( π / a ) 2 . So, it is now possible to evaluate G 11 in the case of p-polarized incident wave because: 〈 1 | k ∥ σ 〉 = ( 1 0 ) ( k x 0 ) t 2 k x a p ∫ x = − p / 2 x = p / 2 sin π a x exp ( i k x x ) dx = i cos ak x 2 ( 2 a ) 3 / 2 ( π 2 − k x 2 a 2 ) p if | k x | ≠ π a i 2 π p | k x | 3 / 2 if | k x | = π a And then we can evaluate G 11, G 01, G 10, G 1 V , Σ1 and resolve the system of equations given below in order to obtain E 0, E 1, E 0 ′ and E 1 ′ and then T and R. ( G 00 − Σ 0 ) E 0 + G 01 E 1 − G 0 V E 0 ′ = I 0 ( G 11 − Σ 1 ) E 1 + G 10 E 0 − G 1 V E 1 ′ = I 1 ( G 00 ′ − Σ 0 ) E 0 ′ + G 01 E 1 ′ − G 0 V E 0 = 0 ( G 11 ′ − Σ 1 ) E 1 ′ + G 10 E 0 ′ − G 1 V E 1 = 0 4 Scattering on a 1D periodic array of slits forming the top mirror of a Fabry-Perot cavity photodetector Now, we are interesting in the reflection and absorption of the system shown in Fig. 3 , where the periodic array of slits is backed by a stack of dielectric layers finished by a semi-infinite metallic layer serving as back-mirror of the cavity. We have to consider the waves reflected by the stacked of the layers and then the expression of the field in the region III (here we insure that ϵ 3 defined in the case of a grid without cavity is equal to ϵ n defined here). The field in the region III becomes (see Eq. (3)) expressed in terms of transmission amplitudes t k ∥σ : (37) | E III ⟩ = ∑ k σ ( t k ∥ σ e i k z ' ( z - h ) + Π k ∥ σ e - i k z ' ( z - h ) ) | k ∥ σ ⟩ (38) | - u z × H III ⟩ = ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ' ( t k ∥ σ e i k z ' ( z - h ) - Π k ∥ σ e - i k z ' ( z - h ) ) | k ∥ σ ⟩ 4.1 Continuity of the electric field in z = h The continuity equation of the Electric Field in z = h (same method as in Eqs. (17) and (18)) gives once projected on the 〈 k ∥ σ|: In z = h −, u n =− u z and we have: (39) ∑ α ( C α e i k α z h + D α e - i k α z h ) | α ⟩ = - ∑ α z s Y α ( C α e i k α z h - D α e - i k α z h ) | α ⟩ In z = h +, (40) ∑ k ∥ σ ( t k ∥ σ + Π k ∥ σ ) | k ∥ σ ⟩ = ∑ k ∥ σ - z s Y k ∥ σ ' ( t k ∥ σ - Π k ∥ σ ) | k ∥ σ ⟩ Once projected on the 〈 k ∥ σ|, (40) and (39) gives: ( t k ∥ σ + Π k ∥ σ ) - ∑ α ( C α e i k α z h + D α e - i k α z h ) ⟨ k ∥ σ | α ⟩ = - z s Y k ∥ σ ' ( t k ∥ σ - Π k ∥ σ ) + ∑ α z s Y α ( C α e i k α z h - D α e - i k α z h ) ⟨ k ∥ σ | α ⟩ ⇔ (41) f k ∥ σ ′ + t k ∥ σ + f k ∥ σ ′ − Π k ∥ σ = − ∑ α 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 E α ′ The dielectrics layers below the scattering grid are assumed to be uniform and then the set of | k ∥ σ〉 is a subset of the orthogonal eigenmode basis (plane waves) which is independent of the layer. Therefore, as in a basic 1D uniform multilayer problem, no scattering occurs and we can calculate for each | k ∥ σ〉 the reflection coefficient R k ∥ σ brought by the cavity which is defined by: (42) R k ∥ σ = Π k ∥ σ t k ∥ σ The reflection coefficient of a stack of uniform dielectric layers ended by a semi infinite layer (the metallic mirror here) is easily obtained by a transfer matrix method or a scattering matrix method (which is more robust, in terms of numerical stability, see [11] for example). We define the total S matrix as just below: t k ∥ σ metal Π k ∥ σ = S 11 S 12 S 21 S 22 · Π k ∥ σ metal t k ∥ σ Once the total scattering matrix obtained (see Fig. 4 for the definition of forward and backward waves) which gives the linear dependency between the waves right after the metallic grid and at the beginning of the semi-infinite gold layer R k ∥ σ is easily calculated. Indeed, the backward wave in the metallic layer, Π k ∥ σ is null and then: (43) R k ∥ σ = S 11 Now if we come back to Eq. (41), we can obtain an equation similar to Eq. (20) found in the case of a grid without cavity but with a slight different factor. (44) − ∑ α 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 E α ′ = f k ∥ σ ′ + t k ∥ σ + f k ∥ σ ′ − t k ∥ σ R k ∥ σ = t k ∥ σ ( f k ∥ σ ′ + + f k ∥ σ ′ − R k ∥ σ ) which gives: (45) t k ∥ σ = − 1 F k ∥ σ ∑ α 〈 k ∥ σ | α 〉 E α ′ where F k ∥ σ = f k ∥ σ ′ + + f k ∥ σ ′ − R k ∥ σ 4.2 Continuity of the magnetic field in z = h Now, it remains to use the second continuity equation at the backside interface where the problem is different from the grid without cavity. The continuity of the magnetic field gives after projection on |α〉: (46) ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ′ ( t k ∥ σ − Π k ∥ σ ) 〈 α | k ∥ σ 〉 = Y α ( C α e i k α z h − D α e − i k α z h ) ⇔ (47) ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ′ t k ∥ σ ( 1 − R k ∥ σ ) 〈 α | k ∥ σ 〉 = Y α ( C α e i k α z h − D α e − i k α z h ) If we put the expressions of t k∥σ given in Eq. (45) in theses expressions, we obtain: ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ σ ′ 1 F k ∥ σ ∑ β 〈 k ∥ σ | β 〉 E β ′ ( 1 − R k ∥ σ ) 〈 α | k ∥ σ 〉 = − Y α ( C α e i k α z h − D α e − i k α z h ) ⇔ ∑ β G α β ′ c E β ′ = − Y α ( C α e i k α z h − D α e − i k α z h ) where: (48) G α β ′ c = ∑ k ∥ σ Y k ∥ ′ ( 1 − R k ∥ σ ) F k ∥ σ 〈 α | k ∥ σ 〉 〈 k ∥ σ | β 〉 E β ′ Eventually, we have a similar set of equations to the one obtained in the case of the grid without cavity (Eqs. (33) and (34)). We have only to use G ′ c instead of G′. Once the E α and E α ′ are calculated by resolving the two-equation (if only one waveguide mode is taken into account) linear system, the electromagnetic fields can be derived in the structure and then for a given incident optical power, the power reflected by the whole structure and the amount of power absorbed in each layer can be easily calculated. 4.3 Comparison with results obtained by Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis The SMEF has been implemented to study the electromagnetic response to a normally incident plane wave (wavelength λ = 800 nm) of a resonant photoconductor as shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 6 are compared the absorbance of the GaAs layer as calculated by the SMEF and by a rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) [13] as a function of the layer thickness and the period (the width of the slit a = 0.5p). The 400 simulation points required to plot the figures have needed a 13 times longer duration by using the RCWA method (despite the use of a small number of harmonics n = 20), than by using the SMEF (number of waveguide mode n s = 1, number of diffracted mode n D = 1) implemented on the same platform (SCILAB). It is easily explained by the fact that each simulation point requires the inversion of a 2×2 matrix for the SMEF instead of a 20×20 matrix for the RCWA. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the numerical results obtained by both analysis are similar, nevertheless it can be noticed that the absorbance is overestimated by the SMEF. This is consistent with the fact that in we have considered here that the metal was a perfect metallic conductor (PEC) inside the slit in order to keep the very simple analytic form of the waveguide mode. Then the losses induced by the metal and the effective width of the slit are underestimated. As already mentioned before [12], the accuracy of this method could be improved by taking into account of the effect of the non perfect metal on the waveguide modes in the slits.

Appendix A Calcul of the admittance Y k∥σ Here, we demonstrate the relation between E t and H t in the s and p-polarization. In both case, it is based on the Maxwell-Faraday equation in CGS: rot → E = − 1 c ∂ B ∂ t where c is the speed of light in free space. Furthermore, if we assume that the materials have no magnetization,then H = B . A.1 s-Polarization For a s-polarized incident plane wave, (i.e. E z =0, ϕ( r , t)= k · r − ωt) of pulsation ω and of wave vector k =(k x , k y , k z ) t rot → E = − 1 c ∂ B ∂ t becomes: (49) jk x jk y jk z × E x E y 0 = 1 c · j ω H x j ω H y j ω H z ⇔ (50) − k z E y k z E x k x E y − jk y E x = k ω H x k ω H y k ω H z Now, if we are only interested by the transverse parts of E and H , we have indeed: (51) | - u z × H ⟩ = 0 0 - 1 × H x H y H z = H y - H x 0 = Y k ∥ s · E x E y 0 with Y k ∥ s = k z k ω . A.2 p-Polarization For a p-polarized incident plane wave, (i.e. H z =0, ϕ( r , t)= k · r − ωt) of pulsation ω and of wave vector k =(k x , k y , k z ) t rot → E = − 1 c ∂ B ∂ t becomes: (52) jk x jk y jk z × E x E y E z = 1 c · j ω H x j ω H y 0 ⇔ (53) k y E z − k z E y k z E x − k x E z k x E y − k y E x = k ω H x k ω H y 0 So, it gives that k x E y = k y E x and we know that without electric charge:k x E x + k y E y + k z E z =0. It gives for the x term: (54) k y E z − k z E y = − k y k x k z E x − k y 2 k z E y − k z E y = − k y 2 k z E y − k y 2 k z E y − k z E y = − 1 k z ( k ∥ 2 + k z 2 ) E y = − 1 k z ϵ 1 k ω 2 E y So for the x-term: k y E z − k z E y = k ω H x ⇔ 1 k z ϵ 1 k ω E y = − H x Now, if we are interested by the y term: (55) k z E x − k x E z = k x k y k z E y + k x 2 k z E x + k z E x = k y 2 k z E x + k x 2 k z E x + k z E x = 1 k z ( k ∥ 2 + k z 2 ) E x = − 1 k z ϵ 1 k ω 2 E x Eventually, for the y-term: k z E x − k x E z = k ω H y ⇔ ϵ 1 k ω k z E x = H y Now, if we are only interested by the transverse parts of E and H , we have indeed: (56) | - u z × H ⟩ = 0 0 - 1 × H x H y H z = H y - H x 0 = Y k ∥ p · E x E y 0 with Y k ∥ p = k ω ϵ 1 k z .

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.09.093,Properties of boehmite (γ-AlOOH) and Eu3+-doped boehmite synthesized by hydrothermal method,"Abstract Boehmite nanoplates and Eu3+-doped boehmite nanoplates were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction. And the boehmite nanoparticles behave as plate-like in morphology and have a small size about 59nm. Those nanoplates could be effectively excited by near-UV light in the range of 360nm to 420nm. Because of existing of anionic oxygen vacancies (F-center) in those nanoplates, it has a broad emission peak at 483nm excited at 393nm. The emission peak at 615nm split into two peaks because of the way of asymmetric occupation about Eu3+ ions in the boehmite crystal lattice. Based on the experimental results, boehmite and Eu3+-doped boehmite nanoplates have great potential to serve as an attractive candidate in the application of luminescent devices.",Feb-18," Keywords Boehmite Nanoplates Hydrothermal method 1 Introduction Boehmite has been studied in many fields, such as catalyst, catalyst carrier, adsorbent and so on [1–7]. In addition, boehmite as the precursor of γ-alumina has also caused great attention because of special features [8]. What's more, it has been reported that γ-alumina could be obtained by calcining boehmite nanoplates without changing its original shape and size [9]. Hydrothermal method has been developed rapidly because of its advantages such as simple and size-controlled compared with the solid phase method [11] and microwave method [12] since it is adopted by Bugosh [10] to synthesized boehmite nanofibers firstly. To date, boehmite has been synthesized in different morphologies (boehmite whisker, single-crystal boehmite nanobelts, nanorods, nanoflakes, nanofibers, boehmite flowerlike, etc.) [11,14–17] and studied in structure [18], photocatalysis and other properties. However, optical properties about rare earth doped boehmite, which synthesized by hydrothermal, has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this paper, in order to studying the optical properties, we synthesized boehmite nanoplates and Eu3+-doped boehmite nanoplates by hydrothermal method. And the samples can produce blue emission or blue and red mixture emission when excited by near-UV light. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Sample preparation Boehmite nanoplates: The boehmite nanoplates were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction with aluminium isopropoxide (A.R. ≥98%) and deionized water. All processes were carried out in air, 1.6339g of aluminium isopropoxide was added into 80ml deionized water in a glass beaker and vigorous stirring for 1h. The stirred solution was transferred into a 100ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 220°C for 24h, then natural cool down to room temperature. Eu3+-doped boehmite nanoplates: Eu3+-doped boehmite nanoplates were prepared with the raw materials Aluminium isopropoxide (1.6339g), Europium nitrate pentahydrate (A.R. 99.9%) (0.1712g) and deionized water (80ml). Similarly, all solvents were dissolved in deionized water and the next steps were as same as the process of synthesizing boehmite nanoplates. Boehmite powder: The products were obtained after the reaction solutions were centrifuged and washed with anhydrous ethanol and deionized water for several times and dried at 90°C overnight. 2.2 Characterization The phase identification of the samples were carried out by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker Axs D2 PHASER diffractometer, Cu kα=0.15406nm) with 2θ ranging from 10° to 80°, operating at 30kV and 10mA. The morphology of the nanoplates were observed through a field-emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and examined by a HitachiH-9500 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The excitation and emission spectra of nanoplates were measured by a PL3-211-P spectrometer (HORIBA JOBIN YVON, America). The diffuse reflectance spectra were investigate by a UV-3600 UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) contrasting to the white powder BaSO4. Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) (Brook Tensor 27) was used to detect the chemical identity of nanoplates. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Phase identification and crystal structure Fig. 1 (a) depicts the XRD patterns of boehmite, Eu3+-doped boehmite and the standard date card of boehmite (PDF#21-1307). It’s obviously that the diffraction peak positions and the intensities of the samples were well matched with the standard date card of boehmite, indicating that the crystal structure of the sample which doped Eu3+ ions is not changed. Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD pattern of doped sample and related Rietveld refinement which obtained by the Material Studio program, and the refinement of parameters Rwp 9.29% and Rp 6.75%. The size and the morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It's distinct that those nanoparticles both look like plates and only have a few nanometers in thickness (Fig. 2 ). By observing the SEM images, obvious phenomenon of agglomeration can be seen in the samples because of the effect of surface functional groups and quantum size effect. And the thickness of nanoplates vary from 10nm to 21nm (Fig. 2a.inset.1). The thickness of nanoplates (along [010] direction, compliance with the boehmite lamellar structure), which can be measured from [020] and [080] lines broadening using the Scherrer formula, is well matched with the observed value [20,21]. The plate-like morphology can also be demonstrated by TEM and its size about 59nm (Fig. 2a. inset.2). A schematic diagram of boehmite's morphology is showed in Fig. 2 (b). Throughout all nanoplates, it seems to be exhibiting predominant (101) lateral faces in every cases, which can also be proved in Fig. 3 a.inset.1 [20]. The HRTEM image of Fig. 2a.inset.4 (obtained from Fig. 2a.inset.2) shows the interplanar crystal spacing of 0.608nm, which agree with the value has been reported before [6]. It was considered as orthogonal octahedral structure of crystal system and the symmetry was described by space group Cmcm. Until now, this is the best model reported for boehmite's crystalline [1,6,15,18,20]. The elemental composition of Eu3+-doped boehmite is tested by energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and shown in Fig. 3(c). It demonstrates that Al, O and Eu exist in the product and it was proven to be pure after centrifugal washing because of almost no carbon content. What's more, the stoichiometric weight ratio of each element in boehmite (AlOOH:Eu3+) is Al 38.72%, O 48.30%, H 1.52% and Eu 11.47%, which was well matched with the contents detected by EDS (Al 43.05%, O 47.53% and Eu 9.42%) within the margin of error. In a word, the Eu3+ ion has successfully enter into the boehmite crystal lattice. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR absorption spectra of boehmite. It's clear to see that the sample exists all basically characteristic peak. The peaks at 3086cm−1 and ∼3290cm−1 could be ascribed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of AlOH group, respectively. The peaks at ∼1069cm−1 and ∼1159cm−1 indicate that symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations of AlOH in the boehmite lattice. In the meantime, there are another three peaks can also be observed in the spectra: ∼737cm−1, ∼617cm−1 and ∼482cm−1, which corresponding to the torsional mode, the stretching and the bending vibration of AlO. Besides the obvious peaks in the spectra, there are several relatively weak peaks in the range of 1400cm−1 to 2500cm−1. Those peaks are caused by residual organic species. However, there was no redundant defect luminescence phenomena caused by residual organic species, which can be verified by excitation spectra and emission spectra. The peaks at ∼1968cm−1 and ∼2086cm−1 appear in the samples are associated with the CO stretching modes. The peak at ∼1635cm−1 belongs to the hydroxyl bands on the surface [17–22]. The absorption center at ∼1449cm−1 belongs to the CH stretching mode [19]. 3.2 Diffuse reflection spectra The diffuse reflection spectra of pure and Eu3+-doped boehmite are shown in Fig. 5 . The reflection intensity of pure boehmite is almost above 80% in the wavelength range of 200–800nm and shows a distinct drop in the range of full spectrum because of the transition between valence band and conduction band in the boehmite host lattice. There are several relatively weak absorption peak in around 320nm, 363nm, 399nm and 466nm, which can be ascribed to the characteristic transitions of Eu3+ from the ground state to the higher energy levels: 7F0 → 5H5 (322nm), 7F0 → 5D4 (362nm), 5D0 → 5L7 (385nm), 7F0 → 5L6 (393nm), 7F0 → 5D3 (404nm), and 7F0 → 5D2 (466nm). And it was well matched with the excitation spectra, which monitored at 615nm [23]. What's more, the other absorption peak appeares in 260nm, however, the emission intensity was not enhanced correspondingly, so it was speculated that the absorption band was ascribed to the transition toward the charge transfer state from the 2p orbital of O2− ions to the 4f orbital of Eu3+ ions [13]. Due to the absorption around 450nm, the intensity of blue emission decreased, which phenomenon has been mentioned above. 3.3 Photoluminescence properties Fig. 6 (a) illustrates the emission spectra of the boehmite (black solid line) and Eu3+-doped boehmite (red solid line). The emission spectra of boehmite and Eu3+-doped boehmite show a broad emission band in the wavelength range of 450–550nm, which is attributed to lattice anionic oxygen vacancies (F-center). And the lattice anionic oxygen vacancies (F-center) were introduced by capturing an electron during the hydrothermal reaction [11–15]. The emission intensity of boehmite is about three times the intensity of Eu3+ −doped boehmite at the peak position, and the phenomenon will be explained in the given below. In addition to the difference of the strength between the samples, there is a small blue shift from 483nm to 475nm may be caused by the lattice distortion. By studying the emission spectra of Eu3+-doped boehmite, there are five main peaks appear at 579nm (5D0 → 7F0), 588nm (5D0 → 7F1), 615nm (5D0 → 7F2), 654nm (5D0 → 7F3) and 698nm (5D0 → 7F4), which created by Eu3+ ions. Due to the Eu3+ ions’ asymmetric occupation in the crystal lattice, the emission peak at 615nm split into two peaks at 611nm and 618nm. In order to obtain as much as possible of red light, excitation spectra monitored at 615nm was tested for Eu3+-doped boehmite (Fig. 6(b)). A narrow sharp peak at 393nm (7F0 → 5L6) was noticed in the excitation spectra, thus, it’s the most suitable excitation wavelength. What's more, the peak positions at 360nm and 467nm are ascribe to 7F0 → 5G2 and 7F0 → 5D2, respectively. And the excitation spectra of boehmite and Eu3+-doped boehmite monitor at 483nm and 475nm, respectively, were also researched. It's obvious to found that they have the similar peak position and have an overlap. Thus, it was speculated that energy transfer exists between boehmite and Eu3+ ions and the residual organic species has limited effect in luminescence. Combined with Figs. 5 and 6, it was suspected that the intensity of main emission peak located at 475nm appears the phenomenon of sharp attenuation, which could be contributed to the absorption at 467nm and the diffuse reflection spectra entire lowing after doping Eu3+, for the above reasons, the fluorescence spectrum intensity weakened as a whole. In other words, the decrease of fluorescence intensity at ∼475nm was caused by the re-absorption between substrate and Eu3+. 4 Conclusions In short, boehmite and Eu3+-doped boehmite nanoplates were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal reaction method and their morphology and luminescence properties were also studied. The boehmite nanoplates present a blue emission band with a peak at 483nm under the excitation wavelength of 393nm. While the Eu3+-doped boehmite nanoplates present a blue emission band at 475nm under the excitation wavelength of 393nm and the red emission peak at 615nm occurs the phenomenon of splitting because of the asymmetric occupay in the crystal lattice by Eu3+ ions. All the spectrum features suggest that boehmite naoplates have great potential in white light emitting diode.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.062,Simulation of LSPR based fiber optic sensor utilizing layer of platinum nanoparticles,"Abstract Analysis of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based fiber optic sensor using platinum (Pt) nanoparticles is carried out. For a fixed particle size of Pt nanoparticles, the sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) increase with increase in thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer. Besides, sensitivity enlarges as the particle size increases from 5nm to 10nm and afterwards, it starts sinking with further increase in the particle size of Pt nanoparticles for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers. Optimized thickness and particle size of Pt nanoparticles layer are 50nm and 10nm respectively. 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer, particle size 10nm based sensor possesses sensitivity of 7450nm/RIU.",Feb-18," Keywords LSPR Optical fiber Sensor Platinum nanoparticles 1 Introduction Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the main principle behind working of various biosensors and chemical sensors. SPR sensors are most commonly used for the investigations of surface interactions and sensing of liquids as well as gases. Physical, biological and chemical properties of materials can be sensed by using SPR. SPR based optical sensing is the most promising technique [1–3]. Surface plasmons are the charge density oscillations of free electrons in a metal leading in generation of surface plasmon waves. Surface plasmon waves propagate along the interface between a metal and a dielectric media under certain conditions. These waves are transverse in nature with their electric field decaying exponentially in both media. Surface plasmon waves can be excited by using prism coupling, grating coupling and optical fiber coupling. In prism coupling, Kretschmann configuration is generally utilized [4,5]. A high refractive index prism, coated with a thin metal layer is utilized in Kretschmann configuration. The metal layer touches the sample. Evanescent waves from prism at the total reflection condition excite the surface plasmon waves. However, there are some shortcomings in the prism coupler such as bulky size of sensor and incompatibility for remote sensing. In optical fiber coupling, the core of the optical fiber replaces the prism. Optical fiber based SPR devices offer numerous advantages over the prism and grating based SPR devices like simplified and flexible optical design, option of remote sensing, continuous analysis and in situ monitoring [6–8]. To exploit these advantages, a large number of experimental and theoretical research studies on optical fiber based SPR sensing have been reported [9–13]. The extraordinary nano-scale size dependent properties of metal nanoparticles make them unique in several research areas. The metal nanoparticles (having size much smaller than the wavelength of light) disclose outstanding optical properties and better sensing behavior than materials in the micro or larger scales [14]. The interface between metal nanoparticles and dielectric medium generates considerable changes in the optical properties, which make them size and shape dependent. Generally, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) pertains to metallic nanoparticles and occurs when the wave vector and frequency of incident p-polarized light match with that of the collective oscillations of conduction electrons in metallic nanoparticles [15]. LSPR wavelength is dependent on nanoparticle’s size, shape, material and refractive index of surrounding medium [16,17]. Also, one of the most important features of LSPR is its sensing applications because the sensitivity of LSPR based sensor is controlled and optimized by changing the shape and size of nanoparticles [18–20]. Recently, platinum (Pt) has grabbed much attention of researchers because of its great performance and long lasting stability. Pt is an inert and chemically stable metal. It is highly reflecting and has high melting point. Pt has shown remarkable applications in optoelectronic devices, solar absorbers and jewellery industry [21]. Pt nanomaterials have been applied in various research fields including sensors, fuel cells, automotive industry, petroleum refining, hydrogen production and anticancer drugs [22–24]. In this paper, we theoretically report LSPR based fiber optic sensor utilizing Pt nanoparticles. It is to be mentioned here that the present research is quite novel as several research investigations using Pt nanoparticles have been carried out. However, the utilization of Pt nanoparticles in LSPR based fiber optic refractive index sensor has not been studied. The outcomes of thickness and particle size of Pt nanoparticles layer on the sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) of sensor have been thoroughly studied. For a fixed particle size of Pt nanoparticles, the sensitivity and FOM increase with increase in thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer. In addition, the sensitivity is increased as the particle size increases from 5nm to 10nm and then, it starts decreasing with further increase in the particle size of Pt nanoparticles for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers. Optimized values of thickness and particle size of Pt nanoparticles layer are obtained to be 50nm and 10nm respectively. Sensor with 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer, particle size 10nm demonstrates largest sensitivity of 7450nm/RIU. 2 Theory LSPR sensing is based on the principle of ATR with Kretschmann configuration. In proposed LSPR based fiber optic sensor, the sensing probe is a three layer system consisting of fiber core-Pt nanoparticles layer-sensing medium as shown in Fig. 1 . The plastic cladding around the core from the middle portion of a step index multimode plastic clad silica (PCS) fiber (Numerical aperture=0.24 and fiber core diameter=600μm) is removed and the bare core is then coated with a thin layer of Pt nanoparticles, which is then finally enclosed by the sensing medium. Wavelength interrogation technique is utilized to analyze the LSPR sensor. In this technique, the light from a broadband source is launched into one of the ends of the optical fiber with suitable optics and the transmitted light is detected at the other end of the optical fiber. At resonance wavelength, a sharp dip in the transmitted power appears. The resonance wavelength is dependent on the refractive index of sensing medium. The core of optical fiber is presumed to be made of fused silica. The refractive index of fused silica depends on wavelength according to Sellmeier dispersion relation as, (1) n 1 ( λ ) = 1 + a 1 λ 2 λ 2 − b 1 2 + a 2 λ 2 λ 2 − b 2 2 + a 3 λ 2 λ 2 − b 3 2 Where, λ is the wavelength in μm and a1 , a2 , a3 , b1 , b2 and b3 are Sellmeier coefficients. The values of these coefficients are written as, a1 =0.6961663, a2 =0.4079426, a3 =0.8974794, b1 =0.0684043μm, b2 =0.1162414μm and b3 =9.896161μm [25]. Pt nanoparticles are considered to be spherical in shape with radius (R) 5nm, 10nm, 15nm, 20nm and 25nm. The mean free path of Drude electrons is reduced by the finite size of spherical nanoparticles and the size-dependent damping constant of Drude electrons of a metal is written as [26], (2) Γ = Γ B u l k + A v f R Where, Γ Bulk is the damping constant of the bulk material, A is constant equal to a value near unity, v f is the fermi velocity and R is the radius of the spherical nanoparticle. In addition, bulk collision wavelength (λ cBulk ) corresponds to the damping of electron density oscillations due to collisions among the electrons in the bulk metal. In terms of bulk collision wavelength, the above Eq. (2) takes the final form as follows to provide the size-dependence of the collision wavelength (λ c ), (3) c λ c = c λ c B u l k + A v f R Here, c is the speed of light in vacuum. The complex dielectric constant of a metal is written according to Drude model as, (4) ε m ( λ ) = ε m r + i ε m i = 1 − λ 2 λ c λ p 2 ( λ c + i λ ) Here, ε mr and ε mi are the real and imaginary parts of complex dielectric constant of metal respectively. In addition, λp and λc are plasma wavelength and collision wavelength of metal respectively. Values of λ p , λ cBulk and v f for Pt are mentioned in Table 1 [27,28]. The dielectric constant of sensing medium can be written as, ε s = n s 2 , where n s is the refractive index of the sensing medium. Resonance condition for the excitation of surface plasmon wave is written as, (5) 2 π λ n 1 sin θ = Re { K s p } Where, K s p = ω c ε m ε s ε m + ε s = 2 π λ ε m n s 2 ε m + n s 2 is the propagation constant of surface plasmon wave and c is the speed of light in vacuum. 2.1 Transmitted power The expression of reflection coefficient (reflectance) for p-polarized incident light is obtained by using matrix method of N-layer structure [29]. Considering that all the guided rays are launched in the fiber using a collimated source and a microscope objective, the angular power distribution of rays guided in the fiber is written as [30], (6) d P ∝ n 1 2 sin θ cos θ ( 1 − n 1 2 cos 2 θ ) 2 d θ Where, θ is the angle of the ray with the normal to the core-cladding interface. Also, n1 is the refractive index of the core of the fiber. To determine the effective transmitted power, the reflectance (Rp ) for a single reflection is raised to the power of the number of reflections the specific propagating angle undergoes with the sensor interface. Hence, for p-polarized light, the generalized expression for normalized transmitted power in an optical fiber based SPR sensor will be given as, (7) P t r a n s = ∫ θ c r π / 2 R p N r e f ( θ ) n 1 2 sin θ cos θ ( 1 − n 1 2 cos 2 θ ) 2 d θ ∫ θ c r π / 2 n 1 2 sin θ cos θ ( 1 − n 1 2 cos 2 θ ) 2 d θ Where, (8) N r e f ( θ ) = L D tan θ And, (9) θ c r = sin − 1 ( n c l n 1 ) Where, N ref (θ) is the total number of reflections performed by a ray making an angle θ with the normal to the core-metal layer interface in the sensing region. L and D represent the length of the exposed sensing region and the fiber core diameter respectively. In addition, θ cr is the critical angle of the fiber and ncl is the refractive index of the cladding of the fiber. 2.2 Sensitivity and figure of merit Sensitivity of SPR sensor utilizing wavelength interrogation method is expressed as the change in resonance wavelength per unit change in refractive index of the sensing medium [31]. Also, figure of merit of SPR sensor is defined as the ratio of sensitivity of sensor to FWHM of SPR spectrum [32]. 3 Results and discussion In the present research study, several solutions of glycerine in water with different concentrations, having refractive indices in the range from 1.33 to 1.37 are considered as the sensing mediums. For theoretical calculations, following values of parameters have been assumed: Numerical aperture of the fiber=0.24, fiber core diameter D=600μm, length of the exposed sensing region L=15mm. For optimizing the thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer, the transmitted output power of LSPR sensor is measured for various thicknesses i.e. 10nm, 20nm, 30nm, 40nm and 50nm of Pt nanoparticles layer. Fig. 2 depicts the variations of resonance wavelength of LSPR sensor with refractive index of sensing medium for 10nm, 20nm, 30nm and 40nm thick Pt nanoparticles layers with nanoparticle size of 5nm. It is obvious from this figure that resonance wavelengths for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers get raised linearly with increase in refractive index of sensing medium. Here, it becomes essential to mention that the calculations of transmitted power of LSPR based fiber optic sensor have also been done for 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer with nanoparticle size of 5nm. However, 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer with nanoparticle size of 5nm has not been discussed in the present study because the clear resonance minima has not been observed for 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer with nanoparticle size of 5nm. Similarly, Fig. 3 a describes the plots of resonance wavelength of LSPR sensor with refractive index of sensing medium for 10nm, 20nm, 30nm, 40nm and 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layers with nanoparticle size of 10nm. It can be viewed that resonance wavelengths for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers increase linearly with increase in refractive index of sensing medium and follow the same pattern of Fig. 2. In the same way, Fig. 3b–d shows the variations of resonance wavelength with refractive index of sensing medium for 10nm, 20nm, 30nm, 40nm and 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layers with nanoparticle sizes of 15nm, 20nm and 25nm respectively. It is again observed that the resonance wavelengths enlarge with increase in refractive index of sensing medium for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers. The rationale behind these expansions of resonance wavelengths with increase in refractive index of sensing medium for various thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers can be explained by Eq. (5). The real part of propagation constant (K sp ) of surface plasmon wave will be larger for large value of refractive index of sensing medium and so, its resonance condition is satisfied at higher wavelength [29]. In the same way, for small value of refractive index of sensing medium, the real part of K sp will be smaller and thus, the resonance condition is satisfied at shorter wavelength. However, for nanoparticles with particle size of 10nm, the variations in resonance wavelengths with refractive index of sensing medium are larger than that of nanoparticles with particle sizes of 5nm, 15nm, 20nm and 25nm. Fig. 4 a illustrates the plot of sensitivity of LSPR sensor with thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer for 5nm particle size of Pt nanoparticles. It can be seen from this figure that the sensitivity increases with increase in thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer. Likewise, Fig. 4b represents the plots of sensitivity with thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer for fixed 10nm, 15nm, 20nm and 25nm particle sizes of Pt nanoparticles. It is obvious that the sensitivity is enhanced as the thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer is raised from 10nm to 50nm for each particle size of Pt nanoparticles. It occurs because Pt possesses large value of real part of its dielectric function at all wavelengths. Thus, Pt enhances the shift between resonance wavelengths for a given change of refractive index of the sensing medium for each thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer and hence, the sensitivity of SPR sensor enlarges with the increase in the thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer. Also, Fig. 4c indicates the variations of sensitivity of LSPR sensor with particle size of Pt nanoparticles for fixed 10nm, 20nm, 30nm, 40nm and 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layers. For a fixed particle size of Pt nanoparticles, the sensitivity is enhanced as the thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer is raised from 10nm to 50nm. Besides it, the sensitivity is found to be the highest for 10nm particle size for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers. Therefore, from Fig. 4a and c, it can be understood that the sensitivity increases as the particle size increases from 5nm to 10nm and then, it starts reducing with further increase in the particle size of Pt nanoparticles for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers. This fact can be understood in terms of the variation in absorption of light due to the change in particle size of the nanoparticles [33]. It is apparent from Eq. (3) that decrease in particle size causes decrease in collision wavelength (λc ). This increases the imaginary part of the dielectric function of Pt nanoparticles (according to Eq. (4)) and as a result, the imaginary part of Ksp . Since, the imaginary part of Ksp represents the optical absorption of incident light, it is palpable that more absorption of light intensity occurs for Pt nanoparticles of smaller particle size. It results in reduction of transmitted light intensity through the optical fiber and hence, sensitivity gets heightened. Therefore, the sensitivity is more for small particle sizes of Pt nanoparticles. Because of this reason, the sensitivity rises up to the particle size of 10nm and then, it starts falling with further enlargement in the particle sizes of Pt nanoparticles for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers. Moreover, for the estimation of maximum sensitivity of LSPR sensor, the particle size and thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer are optimized. The sensitivities of LSPR sensor for several particle sizes and thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers are matched in Table 2 . It is clarified form Table 2 that 10nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer based LSPR sensor with particle size 10nm displays sensitivity of 1000nm/RIU, while 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer based LSPR sensor with same particle size 10nm presents sensitivity of 7450nm/RIU. Hence, the optimized thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer and optimized particle size of Pt nanoparticles are concluded to be 50nm and 10nm respectively. Fig. 5 a displays the variation of figure of merit (FOM) of LSPR sensor with thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer for 5nm particle size of Pt nanoparticles. It is understandable from this figure that FOM increases with increase in thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer. In the same way, Fig. 5b exposes the variations of FOM with thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer for fixed 10nm, 15nm, 20nm and 25nm particle sizes of Pt nanoparticles. Once again, FOM is found to be enhanced with increase in thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer for all particle sizes of Pt nanoparticles. In addition, Fig. 5c interprets the variations of FOM with particle size of Pt nanoparticles for fixed 10nm, 20nm, 30nm, 40nm and 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layers. For a fixed particle size of Pt nanoparticles, FOM is enlarged as the thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer is increased from 10nm to 50nm. However, FOM attains the maximum value for 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer with particle size of 10nm. Consequently, from above discussion, it is concluded that LSPR based fiber optic sensor with 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer of particle size 10nm reveals maximum sensitivity of 7450nm/RIU. Similar to the phenomenon of fiber optic sensing, some research studies on laser-plasma interaction have been reported in the past [34–37]. 4 Conclusions LSPR based fiber optic sensor with Pt nanoparticles layer is theoretically studied. For a fixed particle size of Pt nanoparticles, the sensitivity and FOM increase with increase in thickness of Pt nanoparticles layer. Also, the sensitivity is enhanced as the particle size increases from 5nm to 10nm and then, it starts falling with further increase in the particle size of Pt nanoparticles for all thicknesses of Pt nanoparticles layers. Optimized values of thickness and particle size of Pt nanoparticles layer are found to be 50nm and 10nm respectively. LSPR sensor with 50nm thick Pt nanoparticles layer, particle size 10nm exhibits highest sensitivity of 7450nm/RIU.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.043,Gray and black optical solitons with quintic nonlinearity,"Abstract A higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the third-order dispersion, the cubic–quintic nonlinearities, derivative non-Kerr nonlinear terms, Kerr dispersion, and stimulated inelastic scattering is considered. The model can be used to describe the subpicosecond or femtosecond optical pulse propagation in highly nonlinear optical fibers. We find the exact gray solitary wave solution (i.e., a dark localized structure with nonzero minimum in intensity) on a continuous-wave background for the equation by adopting an appropriate ansatz solution. The propagation characteristics of such solitary pulses are determined in the presence of all higher-order effects. We also find black solitary wave solutions for the higher-order evolution equation under specific conditions for its coefficients. The parametric conditions on fiber parameters for the existence of both types are given.",Feb-18," Keywords Solitons Third-order dispersion Stimulated inelastic scattering 1 Introduction As it is well known, the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation describes the dynamics of picoseconds optical soliton propagation in nonlinear optical fibers [1]. In the picosecond regime, this equation includes only the group velocity dispersion (GVD) and its counterpart self-phase modulation (SPM). It admits bright or dark soliton type pulse propagation in the anomalous or normal dispersion regimes, respectively [2]. Such solitons can propagate over a long distance without the amplitude attenuation and shape change in the uniform nonlinear fiber under the condition that the GVD balances the SPM [3]. However, several higher-order nonlinear effects like the Kerr dispersion (otherwise called the self-steepening) and the stimulated Raman scattering become important for femtosecond optical pulses [4,5]. Moreover, if short pulses whose duration are nearly 50fs have to be injected, the third-order dispersion (TOD) becomes important and must be included in the equation [6]. Furthermore, in many optical materials, such as semiconductors, semiconductor doped glasses, polydiacetylene toluene sulfonate (PTS), calcogenide glasses, and some transparent organic materials, the quintic non-Kerr nonlinearity arising due to fifth-order susceptibility can be obtained in addition to the SPM [7]. With all these important effects, wave propagation in optical fibers is governed by the higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger (HNLS) equation. In general, unlike the cubic NLS equation, HNLS models governing most practical cases are not completely integrable. In recent years, the femtosecond dark solitary waves or solitons became of increasing interest [8–14]. Physically, dark solitons are intensity dips on top of a continuous wave (cw) background with a phase jump across their intensity minimum [15]. Such objects possess many interesting characteristics and important among them are (i) these pulses are more resistant than bright solitons to perturbations during propagation, and (ii) they are less sensitive to background noise [14]. It is relevant to mention that these solitons are more suitable than bright solitons when used in optical communications [14]. In this paper, a class of dark (gray) solitary wave solutions of HNLS equation with derivative non-Kerr nonlinear terms is derived for the first time under some constraints on system parameters. We have used the ansatz method to solve the model and successfully obtained an exact gray solitary wave solution on a continuous-wave background. Black solitary wave solutions are also presented for some given specific parametric conditions. 2 Governing model We consider the HNLS equation with non-Kerr nonlinear terms describing the propagation of femtosecond pulses through a non-Kerr medium of the form [16,17]: (1) E z = i ( α 1 E tt + α 2 | E | 2 E ) + α 3 E ttt + α 4 ( | E | 2 E ) t + α 5 E ( | E | 2 ) t + i α 6 | E | 4 E + α 7 ( | E | 4 E ) t + α 8 E ( | E | 4 ) t , where E(z, t) is the slowly varying envelope of the electric field, z is the normalized distance along the fiber, and t is the normalized time with the frame of the reference moving along the fiber at the group velocity. The subscripts z and t denote the spatial and temporal partial derivatives, respectively. The coefficients α i (i =1, 2, …, 5) are the real parameters related to GVD, SPM, TOD, self-steepening and self-frequency shift due to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), while α 6, α 7, and α 8 are the quintic non-Kerr terms. Eq. (1) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its applications in the study of pulse propagation in highly nonlinear optical fibers. For instance, Choudhuri and Porsezian [16] presented Dark-in-the-Bright solution also called dipole soliton of (1) under some parametric conditions. In Ref. [7], the impact of dispersion and non-Kerr nonlinearity on the modulational instability within the framework of Eq. (1) have been studied in the presence of an additional fourth-order dispersion term. Moreover, the existence of ultrashort double-kink and algebraic solitons of Eq. (1) with α i =1 (with i =1, 2, 3) has been demonstrated in [18]. Furthermore, bright and dark solitary wave solutions of (1) under the vanishing boundary conditions have been presented in [17]. We note that, for picosecond light pulses, the last six terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) can be omitted, and Eq. (1) reduces to the cubic NLS equation. Also note that by using the inverse scattering transform for the HNLS equation (1) with α 6 = α 7 = α 8 =0, the dark N-soliton solution has been constructed under Hirota parameter conditions in [19]. To our knowledge, studies of dark solitary waves of Eq. (1) under the nonvanishing boundary conditions have not been reported so far. In what follows, we investigate, for the first time, the propagation characteristics of gray optical solitary pulses on a continuous-wave background in a non-Kerr nonlinear medium that is describable in terms of the HNLS equation (1). It is worth mentioning that by appropriately scaling variables E, z and t, the governing Eq. (1) can be written in a dimensionless form with only five free parameters. In the following, however, we shall keep the original formulation with eight parameters in order to examine the individual role of each physical effect on the properties of femtosecond dark solitary waves. To obtain the exact solitary wave solutions of Eq. (1) we consider a solution of the form [20]: (2) E ( z , t ) = A ( z , t ) e i ϕ L ( z , t ) , where A(z, t) is the complex envelope function and ϕ L (z, t)= κz −Ωt is the linear phase shift function. The parameters κ and Ω represent the wave number and the frequency shift of the light pulse, respectively. Substituting (2) into (1) and removing the exponential term, one obtains: (3) iA z + ia 1 A t + a 2 A tt + a 3 | A | 2 A − ia 4 | A | 2 A t − ia 5 A 2 A t * − a 6 A + a 7 | A | 4 A − ia 8 | A | 4 A t − ia 9 A 2 | A | 2 A t * − i α 3 A ttt = 0 , where (4) a 1 = − 2 α 1 Ω + 3 α 3 Ω 2 , a 2 = α 1 − 3 α 3 Ω , a 3 = α 2 − α 4 Ω , a 4 = 2 α 4 + α 5 , a 5 = α 4 + α 5 , a 6 = κ + α 1 Ω 2 − α 3 Ω 3 , a 7 = α 6 − α 7 Ω , a 8 = 3 α 7 + 2 α 8 , a 9 = 2 α 7 + α 8 . In order to investigate localized dark solutions of Eq. (1), we adopt an ansatz soliton solution of the form [20]: (5) A ( z , t ) = i β + λ tanh η t − χ z , where η and χ are the pulse width and the inverse group velocity shift, respectively. It may be worth observing that we are seeking solitary wave solution with non-zero amplitude as t approaches infinity (i.e., |t|→∞). Since the envelope function A(z, t) is complex, the amplitude of A(z, t) is (6) | A ( z , t ) | = λ 2 + β 2 − λ 2 sech 2 η t − χ z 1 / 2 , and its corresponding nonlinear phase shift ϕ NL is (7) ϕ NL ( z , t ) = tan − 1 β λ tanh η t − χ z . For the special case of β =0, dark solitons have been called black; other dark solitons are called gray [21]. Both of these types of solitons play a vital role in understanding various physical phenomena in nonlinear systems. By substituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (3), expanding tanh terms to sech terms, and equating the coefficient terms that contain independent combinations of tanh and sech functions to zero, we obtain the following overdetermined system of equations: (8a) λ η 6 α 3 η 2 + a 4 + a 5 λ 2 + 2 a 8 + a 9 λ 4 + 2 a 8 β 2 λ 2 + a 7 β λ 4 = 0 , (8b) − λ 2 a 2 η 2 + a 3 λ 2 + 2 β η λ 2 a 5 + a 9 λ 2 + β 2 − 2 a 7 λ 3 λ 2 + β 2 = 0 , (8c) λ − χ η + a 1 η − 4 α 3 η 3 − a 4 η λ 2 + β 2 − a 5 η λ 2 − β 2 − 2 a 7 β λ λ 2 + β 2 − a 8 η λ 2 + β 2 2 − a 9 η λ 4 − β 4 − a 3 β λ 2 = 0 , (8d) λ a 3 λ 2 + β 2 − a 6 + a 7 λ 2 + β 2 2 = 0 , (8e) β a 3 λ 2 + β 2 − a 6 + a 7 λ 2 + β 2 2 = 0 , (8f) λ 4 a 7 λ − 2 a 9 β η = 0 , (8g) η λ 5 a 8 + a 9 = 0 . To reach the goal of finding the solitary wave parameters, we need to impose some restrictions on the model coefficients so that Eq. (8) become compatible. 3 Gray solitons In what follows below, we present the parametric conditions for which the dark solitary wave solution (5) exists for the HNLS equation given in Eq. (1). We will substitute for the parameters a i the expressions in terms of the physical coefficient α j given in (4). Firstly, from Eqs. (4) and (8g), we can get the parametric condition: (9) 5 α 7 + 4 α 8 = 0 , which implies that the derivative quintic non-Kerr terms in Eq. (1) are not independent and the corresponding solitary wave solution is obtained in the framework of this relationship. Now, using Eq. (8a) with Eqs. (8f) and (8g), we obtain (10) λ = η − 6 α 3 3 α 4 + 2 α 5 , which shows that it is necessary to have (11) α 3 3 α 4 + 2 α 5 < 0 . for solitary waves to exist. Then, we get β from Eq. (8b) using the relation: (12) β 1 − 2 α 7 + α 8 α 4 + α 5 β 2 + λ 2 = − 6 α 3 3 α 4 + 2 α 5 Ω − α 1 3 α 4 + 2 α 5 − 3 α 2 α 3 6 α 3 α 4 + α 5 , under the conditions α 3 3 α 4 + 2 α 5 < 0 and α 4 + α 5 ≠ 0 . Further, we find χ from Eq. (8c) as (13) χ = − 2 α 1 Ω + 3 α 3 Ω 2 + 2 α 3 η 2 + α 2 − α 4 Ω β λ / η − α 4 β 2 − 4 α 7 + α 8 β 2 λ 2 + β 2 , Finally, κ is obtained from Eqs. (8d) or (8e) as (14) κ = − α 1 Ω 2 + α 3 Ω 3 + α 2 − α 4 Ω λ 2 + β 2 + α 6 − α 7 Ω λ 2 + β 2 2 , Thus we can write the solitary wave solution of Eq. (1) in the form (15) E ( z , t ) = i β + λ tanh η t − χ z e i κ z − Ω t , where the parameters λ, β, χ and κ are given by the relations (10), and (12)–(14), while η and Ω are free parameters. The corresponding pulse intensity is given by (16) | E ( z , t ) | 2 = λ 2 + β 2 − λ 2 sech 2 η t − χ z . Eq. (15) determines a gray solitary pulse solution for the HNLS Eq. (1) with the minimum and maximum amplitudes equal to β and λ 2 + β 2 , respectively. This propagating envelope exist under the constraints (9) and (11) on the physical parameters. From the above results, we can notice that the optical solitary pulse parameters are uniquely determined from the characteristics of the nonlinear medium, i.e. the GVD, TOD, self-steepening, self-frequency shift, and the quintic non-Kerr terms. Compared with the corresponding solitary wave parameters in [19], quintic non-Kerr coefficients α 6, α 7 and α 8 are added in our parameters (12)–(14), which make our results more coincident with the real situation. The intensity profile of the solitary wave solution (Eq. (15)) is shown in Fig. 1 (a), using the following values for the model parameters [16]: α 2 =1, α 4 =−0.0247, α 6 =1, α 7 =−0.0247 and α 8 =0.030875. To satisfy the condition (11), we choose α 1 =1, α 3 =0, 2744, and α 5 =−0.03705. It is interesting to note that the wave profile remains unchanged during evolution, which we have shown in Fig. 1(b). 4 Black solitons Let us now identify the conditions on fiber parameters for the existence of black type solitary wave solutions of the HNLS equation (1). We notice that when the derivative non-Kerr nonlinear coefficients α 7 and α 8 in Eq. (12) satisfy the condition: (17) α 7 + α 8 = 0 , and if one forces the parameter of frequency shift Ω to take the value: (18) Ω = α 1 3 α 4 + 2 α 5 − 3 α 2 α 3 6 α 3 α 4 + α 5 , we obtain β =0 from Eq. (12), and then we can get the following solitary wave solution for Eq. (1): (19) E ( z , t ) = λ tanh η t − χ z e i κ z − Ω t . For this case, the pulse amplitude given in Eq. (6) reduces to the form (20) | A ( z , t ) | = λ 2 − λ 2 sech 2 η t − χ z 1 / 2 . The latter corresponds to a black solitary pulse solution, for which the minimum of the amplitude |A(z, t)| is zero. The intensity profile of a typical black solitary wave (Eq. (19)) is shown in Fig. 2 (a) for the same values of all parameters as for Fig. 1, except we choose α 7 =−0.0247 and α 8 =0.0247 for the parametric condition (17) to be fulfilled. We see that the solitary wave profile stays unaltered after propagating a distance of 20 normalized lengths, which we have shown in Fig. 2(b). The above results show that we must require 5α 7 +4α 8 =0 for the gray solution to exist, and α 7 + α 8 =0 for the existence of the black solitary wave, but the condition α 3 3 α 4 + 2 α 5 < 0 remains the same for the existence of both types of solitary waves. 5 Conclusion In this paper, the evolution of light pulses in nonlinear media exhibiting nonlinearities up to the fifth-order wherein the pulse propagation is governed by the higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation with derivative non-Kerr nonlinear terms is considered. This equation can be used to model femtosecond optical pulse propagation in highly nonlinear optical fibers. We have obtained an exact gray solitary wave solution (a dark structure with nonzero minimum intensity) on a continuous-wave background by using the ansatz method. We also demonstrated the existence of black solitary wave-type solutions for model under certain conditions on physical parameters. The obtained results are helpful in exploring more solitary waves in highly nonlinear optical fibers and providing a new reference for experimental verification.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.013,Tight focusing properties of anomalous vortex beams,"Abstract Tight focusing properties of an anomalous vortex beam (AVB) passing through a high numerical aperture (NA) lens system are investigated, based on vector Debye integral. The numerical examples show that intensity distribution for the AVBs in focal region depend on the beam parameters including the topological charge m, the order of the AVBs n. Furthermore, the phase distribution and the intensity distribution at the different propagation distance z are discussed in detail. Our results will be useful to find the potential applications of AVBs.",Feb-18," Keywords Singular optics Diffraction theory Laser beam characterization 1 Introduction Vortex is a general phenomenon in wave fields, in which the flow rotates around the dark center [1]. In an optical vortex, its central light intensity is zero and the phase is undetermined [2]. In 1992, Allen et al. identified that vortex beams with a phase term of exp (ilφ) carry an orbital angular momentum of lℏ per photon, where l is the topological charge, φ is the azimuthal angle and ℏ is Planck’s constant [3]. The properties of vortex beams have attracted the strong interest of many researchers [4–6], and so far, vortex beams have found important applications in free-space information transfer and communications [7] and optical manipulation [8], etc. In 2013, a new type of vortex beam called anomalous vortex beam(AVB) has been proposed both theoretically and experimentally, the AVB will eventually become an elegant Laguerre-Gaussian beam in the far field (or in the focal plane) in free space [9]. Recently, the characteristic of AVBs through paraxial optical systems [10,11] and in strongly nonlocal nonlinear media [12] has been discussed. On the other hand, the focusing properties of the beams focused by a high NA lens system have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in high density optical data storage [13], material processing [14] and particle trapping, etc. [15,16]. Therefore, in recent years, the tight focusing properties of vortex beams have been studied extensively [17–23], such as, the degree of polarization has been discussed by considering the distribution of the spectral densities of the three electric field components in the focusing region [17], and the electric fields have been calculated in the study of azimuthally and radially polarized beams focused by a high NA lens system [19], besides, the tight properties of an asymmetric Bessel beam and Gaussian beam are studied in detail as well [21,22]. However, up to now, to our knowledge, the tight focusing properties of AVBs passing through a high NA lens system have not been studied yet. The purpose of this letter is to investigate the tight focusing properties of AVBs, and which will be important to the applications of AVBs in some fields. In Section 2, the theoretical electric fields for AVBs passing through a high NA lens system are derived. In Section 3, some numerical simulation results are presented and discussed. The Section 4 is a summary of the paper. 2 Theory The electric field of the AVB at z=0 is defined as follows (1) E n , m ( r , φ ) = E 0 ( r w 0 ) 2 n + | m | exp ( − r 2 w 0 2 ) exp ( − i m φ ) . where E0 is a constant, n is the beam order of the AVB, m is the topological charge, and w0 is beam waist size of the fundamental Gaussian beam (m=n=0), r and φ are radial and azimuthal coordinates, respectively. According to the vector Debye integral, for a linearly polarized incident beam along x axis, the electric field in the vicinity of the focal region of a high NA lens system can be expressed as [24–26]. (2) E ( ρ , ϕ , z ) = i λ ∫ 0 2 π ∫ 0 α E ( θ , φ ) × T ( θ ) × [ [ cos θ + sin 2 φ ( 1 − cos θ ) ] e x → [ cos φ sin φ ( cos θ − 1 ) ] e y → ( cos φ sin θ ) e z → ] × exp [ − i k ρ sin θ cos ( φ − ϕ ) ] exp ( − i k z cos θ ) sin θ d θ d φ where T(θ) is the apodization function (for an aplanatic lens T ( θ ) = cos 1 2 θ [18]), E(θ, φ) is the pupil apodization function at the entrance pupil, θ is the angle of convergence. The schematic diagram of the tight focusing system is shown in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1, λ is wavelength of the incident beam; k ( k = 2 π λ ) is the wavenumber; f is the focal length of the high numerical aperture objective; The parameters ρ, ϕ, z are the cylindrical coordinates of an observation; e x → , e y → , e z → are the unit vectors along the x, y, z directions, respectively. α is given by numerical aperture value sinα. Under the sine condition, we get r=fsinθ, so that the pupil apodization function of the AVB can be written as (3) E n , m ( θ , φ ) = E 0 ( f sin θ w 0 ) 2 n + | m | exp ( − f 2 sin 2 θ w 0 2 ) exp ( − i m φ ) , According to Eqs. (1)–(3), after some simplification, the x, y, and z components of the electrical field in the vicinity of the focus can be simplified as (4a) E x ( ρ , ϕ , z ) = i k ∫ 0 α A ( θ ) { ( − 1 ) m 1 + cos θ 2 i m J m ( k ρ sin θ ) exp ( − i m ϕ ) − ( − 1 ) m + 2 1 − cos θ 4 i m + 2 J m + 2 ( k ρ sin θ ) exp [ − i ( m + 2 ) ϕ ] − ( − 1 ) m − 2 1 − cos θ 4 i m − 2 J m − 2 ( k ρ sin θ ) exp [ − i ( m − 2 ) ϕ ] } d θ , (4b) E y ( ρ , ϕ , z ) = − k 4 ∫ 0 α A ( θ ) ( cos θ − 1 ) { ( − 1 ) m + 2 i m + 2 J m + 2 ( k ρ sin θ ) exp [ − i ( m + 2 ) ϕ ] − ( − 1 ) m − 2 i m − 2 J m − 2 ( k ρ sin θ ) exp [ − i ( m − 2 ) ϕ ] } d θ , (4c) E z ( ρ , ϕ , z ) = 1 2 i k ∫ 0 α A ( θ ) sin θ { ( − 1 ) m + 1 i m + 1 J m + 1 ( k ρ sin θ ) exp [ − i ( m + 1 ) ϕ ] + ( − 1 ) m − 1 i m − 1 J m − 1 ( k ρ sin θ ) exp [ − i ( m − 1 ) ϕ ] } d θ , where (4d) A ( θ ) = E 0 ( f sin θ w 0 ) 2 n + | m | exp ( − f 2 sin 2 θ w 0 2 ) exp ( − i k z cos θ ) sin θ cos 1 2 θ . and J m (x) is a Bessel function of the first kind of order m. From the above derived equations, we can see that a linearly polarized incident beam along x passing through a high NA lens system, there will produce an orthogonal and a longitudinal component along the incident polarization direction in the vicinity of the focus. 3 Numerical examples and results discussion In this section, we performed some numerical calculations on the focusing properties for the AVBs through a high NA lens system. Fig. 2 shows the total intensity distribution and its x, y, and z components in the focal plane for different topological charges with m =1, 2, and 3, respectively. The other parameters for the calculations are n =3, NA=0.8, λ =632.8nm, w 0 =2mm, f =2mm. Fig. 2(a, a'), (e, e'), and (i, i') show that the total intensity distribution in the focal plane has two peaks along the y direction, the dark region in the center of the total intensity pattern appear and become larger gradually with increasing topological charge number m. It is noted that the intensity distribution of the x-component in the focal plane is similar with the total field, which indicates that the x-component dominates over the total intensity distribution. While, the intensity patterns of y-component and z-component are quite different from that of x-component. For the y-component, there is the maximum light intensity at the intensity pattern for the topological charge m=2. We found that when m>2, a central dark appear in the intensity pattern of y-component and which increases with the increasing m. Besides, we can see that the central bright ring is not a circle but resembling closely a square. For the z-component, there is the maximum light intensity at the center of AVB for the topological charge m =1, the central light intensity will become zero when the topological charge m =2(m =3), and the dark area increases with the increase of the topological charge m. Fig. 3 shows the total intensity distribution and its x, y, and z components in the focal plane with n =1, 5, and 10, respectively. It is shown that with the increasing n, the outer rings around the central ring of the total field are gradually becoming brighter,which because that the outer rings of the x-component brighten gradually [see Fig. 3(b),(f) and (g)]. However, as a whole, with the parameter n increases, the two-dimensional distributions of the total field and each component in the focal plane keep a similar pattern. Therefore, it can be concluded that the influence of parameter n on the shape of the intensity patterns is insignificant. Owing to that in the three components of electric field in the focal plane, the magnitude of x-component is the largest [27], here we give the diagrams of phase distribution and the corresponding two-dimensional distribution in the cross sections of the x-component along z-axis in Fig. 4 . The locations of Fig. 4(a, b), (c, d), (e, f) are z =− λ, 0, λ, respectively, where z =0 refers to the focal plane. As shown in Fig. 4(a), (c), (e), we can see that the helical phase distribution occurs. As the value of the parameter z is changed from negative to positive, it is found that the rotation direction of the phase is changed from anticlockwise rotated to clockwise rotated. Accordingly, the light intensity patterns in Fig. 4(b) and (f) are mirror symmetric. This because that when a light beam passing through the focal plane, the propagation mode of the light will change from the converging wave to the divergent wave, which will lead to the phase reversal and the rotation of the intensity pattern. 4 Conclusions As a summary, we have studied the tight focusing properties of an AVB passing through a high NA lens system. The analytical formulas for the AVBs through the high NA lens system are derived by using the Vector diffraction theory. The intensity distributions in the focal region are investigated, the influences of the topological charge number m and the beam order n on the intensity distributions are discussed in detail. We found that the total intensity pattern is not a rotationally symmetric any longer for the tight focusing cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the influence of parameter n on the shape of the intensity patterns is not as significant as that of parameter m. The theoretical results obtained in this paper might be useful to find the potential application of AVBs in optical trapping.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.038,Potential process design and control for solar cell lean production in future,"Abstract In this paper, the correlation between wafer quality and cell efficiency was studied to identify the key impact factors, such as effective lifetime, impurities and defects. Standard (STD, 2.94E21atoms/cm3) and lightly doped emitter (LDE, 1.08E21atoms/cm3) diffusion were investigated for different qualities wafers. For high impurities wafer, cell efficiency of STD diffusion is 0.44%_abs higher than that of LDE diffusion due to the better gettering by bulk lifetime and iron concentration measurement; for high defect wafer, cell efficiency of STD and LDE are similar; for good wafer (high lifetime, low defect and low impurities), LDE diffusion is better than STD with 0.08%_abs higher cell efficiency due to the better blue wavelength response by using IQE measurement, which should be higher if optimizing firing condition for Fill Factor improvement. Therefore, the possible wafer sorting provides opportunities to design and control different cell process for different incoming wafers to enable the best possible output in a lean production in future.",Feb-18," Keywords Solar cell Wafer quality Diffusion Lean production 1 Introduction As the Photovoltaic (PV) industrial growing, new production lines were installed dramatically, resulting in vast excess capacity and falling returns on capital. Most of PV companies have negative return; cost reduction and quality improvement are the keys to make profit and stand better competitive position in future. These new changes force cell manufacturers, especially those in mainland China, to adjust their extensive type of production to a lean one with better process design and control to be more competitive in both quality and cost. The progress in wafer sorting, such as the utilization of inline photoluminescence (PL) tools, allows cell manufacturers to group their incoming wafers into different categories based on their effective lifetime, impurities, defects, resistivity and other qualities. Intensive study in the past has proved that these wafer qualities have great impacts on the final cell efficiency [1–6]. There is chance to tune the cell process, e.g. diffusion, to reduce or minimize the negative impacts caused by wafer qualities [7–9]. Therefore, the possible wafer sorting provides opportunities to design and control different cell process for different incoming wafers to enable the best possible output in a lean production in future. In this paper, the correlation between wafer quality and cell efficiency was studied to identify the key impact factors, such as effective lifetime, impurities and defects. Different cell processes, e.g. diffusion, were then designed for incoming wafers with different qualities to maximize their power output. In this case, cell manufacturers could use different diffusion recipes to cater different incoming wafers with consideration of production throughput, wafer qualities and output distribution. 2 Experimental details All samples were processed on boron doped multi-crystalline Si wafers, acquired from commercial production which uses directional solidification in a quartz crucible and consequent wire sawing. The size and thickness of the wafers are 156*156mm (a pseudo-square) and 180±20μm, respectively. For the reasons of better comparison, neighboring wafers were selected and divided into different sets according to the qualities, including lifetime, impurities and defects as shown in Fig. 1 and the typical wafer qualities were shown in Fig. 2 using PL. Yellow color represents impurity and blue color represent defect (mainly dislocation). Good wafer (GW) means high lifetime, low impurities and low defects; Impurity wafer (IW) means high impurities and low lifetime; Defect wafer (DW) means high defects, high lifetime and low impurities. There were totally 300pieces (pcs) GW, 300pcs DW and 100pcs IW from same silicon ingot in this test. Wafers were processed into standard Al-BSF solar cells in a screen-print production line including: (1) Standard wet-chemical acidic texturing in an industrial wet-chemical process tool (RENA); (2) The textured wafers were then diffused in a tube diffusion furnace (SevenStar L4511Ⅱ-45/ZM) using the liquid POCl3 as the dopant source; Standard (STD) and Lightly Doped Emitter (LDE) recipes were both used on 3 types of wafers. Mirror-polished CZ wafers were prepared together with test wafers for emitter doping profiles measurement; (3)These diffused wafers then underwent simultaneous wet-chemical rear junction isolation and PSG removal steps by inline wet-chemical process tool (RENA); (4) A SiNx film was then deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD, Centrotherm) onto the front surface of the wafers as an anti-reflective coating (ARC) and passivation layer; (5) The cells were then fabricated by screen printing for back electrodes, back surface field, front electrodes (Baccini) and co-firing in an industrial fast firing furnace (Dispatch) with peak temperature of 955°C. The distribution of the minority-carrier lifetime and iron concentration were measured by microwave photoconductivity-decay technique (μ-PCD) using a SEMILAB-WT2000 instrument. The surface passivation was done chemically using an iodine solution. Before iodine passivation, the sample surface was chemically polished in a mixture of HF, HNO3 and H2O (∼5μm of etch depth). Subsequently, the samples were put into special plastic bags filled with the iodine solution. Air bubbles were removed from the liquid in order to provide a uniform passivation of the whole surface [10]. The bulk lifetime and iron concentration were measured for all groups before and after diffusion with neighbor wafers to check diffusion gettering effect (5 wafers per group). The cells were measured by calibrated current-voltage tester under the standard testing conditions (1000W/m2, AM1.5G spectrum, 25°C cell temperature) by Halm. The PL measurement for wafer qualities was carried out by BT Imaging. The phosphorus (P) diffused emitters were characterized by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) for total dopant profile measurements. IQE measurement was carried out by Vision PVE 300-IVT to analyze the spectral response from 300 to 1100nm wavelength. In this study, two types of diffusion recipes, (i) standard and (ii) lightly doped emitter, were used to process incoming wafers with different qualities. Compared to standard one, improved diffusion recipe produces lightly doped emitter by increasing time (+10mins) and oxygen flux (+800sccm) of drive-in step. 3 Results and discussion P concentration profiles within the crystalline silicon both for STD and LDE diffusion were measured by SIMS as shown in Fig. 3 . In the SIMS method, total P concentration including electrically active and inactive dopants show in the doping profile. On the background of the boron concentration of the P type wafer, which was about 1016 cm−3, the p-n junction depth of STD and LDE diffusion is very similar about 0.4μm. The surface concentration (Cs) of LDE group, which is 1.08×1021 cm−3 and lower than 2.94×1021 cm−3 of STD group, is still higher than the solid solubility limit at 850°C of P in silicon (∼3×1020 cm−3) [11]. The impact of the lower peak concentration to sheet resistance (Rsheet) is limited because most of the reduced P atoms in the n++ layer are electrically inactive [12]. So the Rsheet of STD and LDE are similar about 90ohm/square. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show the lifetime and Fe concentration measurement results for different quality wafers before and after diffusion by μW-PCD. From the data, we can see that the lifetimes of all samples are increased and Fe concentrations are decreased after diffusion gettering, especially for higher impurities wafers. For GW, the improvement of the lifetime and Fe concentration are very small after both STD and LDE diffusion recipe due to less defect and impurity. For DW, the improvement is also small. A possible explanation for this observation is that the impurities precipitate at structural defects (such as dislocation) in the low lifetime regions during P diffusion [13] and are thus not detected by the measurement technique employed herein. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that metal impurities may remain behind in the defected regions after gettering [14]. In particular, dislocations may accommodate impurities either in the dislocation core or in a cloud surrounding the dislocations, and that the former imposes an upper limit for the gettering efficiency of P diffusion [15]. For IW, the result is much different from GW and DW. After STD diffusion, the lifetime of IW is much improved from 2μs to 31μs, and Fe concentration is much decreased from 3.1E12 to 2.1E11; And after LDE recipe, the lifetime of IW is improved from 2μs to 11μs, and Fe concentration is decreased from 3.3E12 to 1.0E12; The improvement of STD recipe is higher than that of LDE recipe, indicating that the gettering of STD recipe is better than LDE recipe due to highly doped with P. The gettering mechanism should be the segregation into a second phase in which the impurity solubility is significantly higher, such as in a region very highly doped with B or P [9]. All samples were fabricated to cells to analyze the relationship among wafer qualities, emitter qualities and cell properties as shown in Table.1 . From the data, we can see that the diffusion effect is different for different quality wafers. For GW, STD recipe is 0.08%_abs lower cell efficiency than LDE diffusion due to lower Voc and Isc, which is easy to understand, because the highly doped n+ layer of STD recipe are regarded like nests of carrier recombination centres while many of the incident photos generate electron-hole pairs within the emitter. Therefore, some part of the photo-generated minority carriers are recombined before being transported from the emitter to the base, resulting in lower Isc [16]. As shown in Fig. 3, Cs of STD recipe is higher than LDE. And also lower Cs is good for blue response as shown in Fig. 5 using IQE measurement, the Cs is lower, the short wavelength response is higher, and the Isc is higher. Like Isc, Voc will also increase with a lower n+ peak. The P surface concentration for both recipes is higher than 1E21cm−3 where the impact of Auger recombination is hardly avoided. The excess dopant higher than 3–5E20cm−3 is electrically inactive and creates Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination centres in the layer. If the Cs is too high, it’s easy to result in SRH recombination and increase the dark saturation current of the solar cell device, resulting in lower Voc. The efficiency gain should be higher than 0.08%_abs if tuning the firing conditions for well contact with metallization to improve Fill factor (FF). For DW, the performance of STD and LDE diffusion recipe is similar. For IW, STD recipe is much better than LDE recipe with 0.44%_abs higher cell efficiency. The reason is the higher lifetime and lower Fe concentration from better gettering of STD as shown in Fig. 4. 4 Conclusion The wafer sorting by utilization of inline PL tools provides opportunities to design and control different cell process for different incoming wafers to enable optimal possible output in a lean production in future. By tuning the diffusion process, the negative impacts caused by wafer qualities can be reduced or minimized. STD diffusion with better gettering effect can improve obviously the lifetime and iron concentration for high impurities wafer, which achieved 0.44%_abs higher cell efficiency than LDE diffusion; LDE diffusion with lower surface concentration achieved 0.08%_abs higher cell efficiency than STD diffusion for GWs. Different wafers using possible diffusion recipe can get more benefit for cell production.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.09.126,Femtosecond laser excited second harmonic and multiphoton absorption induced UV luminescence generation behaviour of ZnO nanofibers,"Abstract Femtosecond (fs) laser excited second harmonic (SH) and multiphoton absorption (MPA) induced UV luminescence generation behaviour of Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanofibers is reported here. The used nanofibers are grown by seed assisted chemical bath deposition technology over glass substrates and are excited by a near-infrared (NIR) Ti: Sapphire laser emitting pulses of wavelength 812nm and duration 100fs. The peak wavelength of SH and MPA induced UV luminescence signals are found to be 406nm and 398nm respectively. Due to good optical quality, no defect level related MPA induced visible luminescence is observed in nanofibers. In comparison to this, ZnO nanostructures grown over plane substrate without seed layer shows very less SH and MPA induced UV luminescence. However in this case, the defect level related MPA induced visible luminescence was found to be very high. Applications like ultrafast pulse diagnostics, NIR induced photodynamic therapy etc. require high SH and MPA induced UV luminescence and low defect level related visible luminescence. So the ZnO nanofibers can be a potential candidate for these applications.",Feb-18," Keywords ZnO nanofiber Second harmonic generation Femtosecond laser Multiphoton absorption induced UV luminescence 1 Introduction The nonlinear optical effects are significantly enhanced in nanostructures due to surface in-homogeneities, higher charge densities and electrostatic potential gradient caused by grain boundaries [1,2]. Compared to other frequency conversion and short wavelength laser schemes, ultrafast multiphoton induced luminescence of semiconductors by NIR photons has become an efficient way to generate highly energetic radiation. The systematic study on such excitation channels of wide bandgap semiconductors using ultrafast lasers are of growing importance. ZnO nanostructures are found to be promising candidates for this purpose because of their direct wide band-gap (3.37eV), intrinsically high nonlinear coefficients [3,4] and transparency at the laser irradiation wavelengths in the NIR spectral region. In this aspect several forms of ZnO nanostructures like nanocrystals [5], nanorods [6] and nanowires [7] has been extensively studied. Recently ZnO nanofibers have drawn much research attention. The surface to volume ratio of such nanostructures is very high and hence these structures are found to be very promising for various applications like photocatalysis [8], gas sensor [9], dye-sensitized solar cell [10], glucose biosensors [11], photonics [12,13] etc. In powder second harmonic generation (SHG) experiment using nanosecond (Nd:YAG) laser Vijayakumar et al. reported that ZnO nanofibers grown by electrospinning and sol-gel technique can show 11.1 times higher efficiency than that of standard nonlinear optical material Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (KDP) [14]. In this work, we did the systematic studies on SH and MPA induced luminescence generation behaviour of ZnO nanofibers excited with NIR fs laser. Comparison is made for the nanostructures grown with and without seed layer. The potential applications are discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis and characterization The ZnO nanofibers are grown on glass substrate by seed assisted chemical bath deposition method. For this, firstly, a solution of 5mM concentration is prepared by mixing Zinc acetate dihydrate with absolute ethanol followed by slow stirring. Then this solution is drop coated four times on a glass substrate. Finally, the sample is calcinated in air medium at 132°C for 120min by using an indigenously built induction heater based heating system to get the seed layer. This substrate is then dipped into a chemical bath containing a mixture of aqueous solution of Zinc nitrate (20mM) and NaOH (0.8M). The solution is heated and maintained at 70°C with constant stirring for 120min to get the film containing ZnO nanofibers. The film is then washed with deionized water and dried with hot air. The formation of ZnO nanofibers are verified by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis. 2.2 SH and MPA induced luminescence generation For SH and MPA induced luminescence generation study the samples are excited by an amplified Ti: Sapphire laser of pulse duration 100fs at 1kHz repetition rate and central wavelength 812nm. A BG40 color glass filter is used to separate the generated radiation from the fundamental/incident radiation. The generated signals are detected by using a fiber coupled spectrometer (Ocean Optics-USB4000). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the FESEM image of the ZnO nanofibers grown on the substrate with seed layer. The average diameter and length of the nanofibers are found to be 86nm and 20μm respectively. The generated radiation from the nanofibers within the wavelength range of 375nm to 700nm is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The fundamental radiation is shown in the inset of this figure. The generated signal in more specific wavelength range (390nm to 420nm) is shown in Fig. 2(b). Here it is found that the generated spectrum can be resolved into two peaks at 398nm and 406nm respectively. The peak at 398nm is due to MPA bandedge luminescence which is 230meV below the bandgap, 3.37eV (368nm) of ZnO at room temperature and is a result of bandgap renormalization [15,16]. The peak at 406nm is the SH signal as because the central wavelength of the fundamental radiation is 812nm (Ref. inset of Fig. 2a). As can be seen from Fig. 2(a); except the SH and MPA induced UV luminescence no other signal is found from ZnO nanofibers. For comparison, ZnO nanostructures are grown on the substrate without any seed layer. The FESEM images of the nanostructures grown in this condition are shown in Fig. 3 . Here the 1D ZnO nanostructures are less dense compared to ZnO nanofibers grown on substrate with seed layer (Refer Fig. 1). Fig. 4 (a) shows the generated signal from the nanostructures grown without any seed assistance whereas Fig. 4(b) shows the Gaussian fits for the SH and MPA induced luminescence signal. Here we also got signal in UV range which can be resolved into MPA induced luminescence peak at 398nm and SH peak at 406nm. However, unlike the seed assisted high density ZnO nanofibers, here we got huge visible (VIS) radiation centered at 545nm. This broad VIS emission is due to the deep level luminescent centres in ZnO [17]. These luminescent centres arise because of various defects like Zni and V0 [18,19]. The absence of this signal in the nanofibers (pl. ref. Fig. 2) indicates that they are of high optical quality (defect free). The signal counts for MPA induced UV signal and SH for nanofibers with seed are 2330 and 7300 respectively. These signal for nanostructures without seed are found to be 1120 and 1900 respectively. So the MPA induced and SH for nanofibers with seed are found to be ∼2 times and ∼4 times higher respectively in comparison to the nanofibers without seed. This happens because of two reasons. Firstly the density of the nanofibers in the former case is higher than the latter case. Secondly a large fraction of the converted spectrum in later case lies in the VIS range. For realization of efficient NIR radiation excited microchip level UV nanolasers[20–23] and photodynamic therapy, only UV radiation (i.e. free of defect level related VIS radiation) generation by MPA process is essential. As our nanofibers show this property they can found to be ideal for these applications. Furthermore, the generated SH signal can be used for realization of cost-effective ultrashort pulses characterization system. 4 Conclusions In this work we studied ultrafast fs laser SH and MPA induced UV generation behaviour in ZnO nanofibers grown by seed assisted chemical bath deposition method. The generated radiation from the nanofibers is found to have two peaks at 406nm and 398nm. The peak at 406nm is the SHG signal and the UV peak at 398nm is due to MPA bandedge luminescence. No defect level related MPA induced visible luminescence is observed in nanofibers. In comparison to this, ZnO nanostructures grown over substrate without seed layer have shown very less SH and MPA induced UV luminescence and very high defect level related MPA induced visible luminescence. For applications like characterization of ultrafast lasers, realization of efficient NIR radiation excited microchip level UV nanolasers and photodynamic therapy; the generation of DLE free bandedge UV emission by MPA process is essential. Therefore the ZnO nanofibers may found to be beneficial for these applications. Acknowledgements The authors thank Ms B Pani (KIIT University) for scientific/technical support. ", [1] J. Ebothe I.V.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.071,Modified vectorial angular spectrum formula for propagation of non-paraxial beams,"Abstract We presented modified forms of full-vector angular spectrum formula without singular points for longitudinal spectral components. In paraxial limitation, the modified angular spectrum formula has the same form as usual angular spectrum formula. Since there are not any singular points at the angular spectrum formula, we can apply it to analyze the propagation of non-paraxial beams with subwavelength-size waist and give results that strictly satisfy Maxwell’s equations because the calculating process includes contributions from all field components and angular spectral components.",Feb-18," Keywords Vectorial angular spectrum formula Non-paraxial beams 1 Introduction The plane wave angular spectrum approach presents an effective integral technique to calculate propagation of electromagnetic waves or laser beams. For propagation of laser beams, the so-called scalar and paraxial approximations are generally adopted. In this case, the contributions from longitudinal field components and evanescent angular spectrum components can be neglected and the scalar plane wave angular spectrum formula is sufficient to describe the propagation of laser beams. However, for the non-paraxial cases where spot sizes of beams are close to or smaller than wavelength of light, the paraxial and scalar approximation of electromagnetic waves no longer holds. Recently, the longitudinal field components and evanescent waves were found to play key roles in the intrinsic dynamic properties of optical fields [1,2], such as spin-orbit coupling and transverse spin angular momentum in structured fields: evanescent waves, interference fields, and focused (non-paraxial) beams. In order to understand the novel properties that are remarkably different from those in paraxial and scalar fields, full vector properties of optical fields, including all field components and full angular spectrum components, have to be considered. Full vector angular spectrum representation of monochromatic electromagnetic fields, which is equivalent to Maxwell’s equations or Helmholtz equation, was firstly derived by Rhodes in his classic papers [3,4]. Since then, the angular spectrum method was widely applied to correct the propagation of laser beams beyond the paraxial approximation [5–8]. Nevertheless, since the traditional form of vector angular spectrum formula is singular at kz =0 for longitudinal field components [6,7,9], the contributions from homogeneous (kz is real) and inhomogeneous waves (kz is imaginary) have to be calculated separately and the spectral components with kz =0 are obliged to be omitted. In paraxial case, the neglect of singular spectral components at kz =0 does not cause any problems since the energy of fields mainly concentrate on spectral region of kz ∼ k. However, for the non-paraxial cases in which spectral components near kz ∼0 are dominant, the neglect is problematic and will cause non-physical results. In addition, the existence of singular points at vectorial angular spectrum formula also results in difficulty in numerical calculation for the propagation of non-paraxial beams. In this paper, we proposed other two forms of full vector angular spectrum formula, which have not any singular points. Firstly, we described the usual vectorial angular spectrum approach and indicated the divergent problem of longitudinal spectral component in this formula. The existence of singular points results that the usual vector angular spectrum formula is not actually applicable for propagation of beams with subwavelength-size waist. Secondly, we derived full vector angular spectrum formula without any singular points and demonstrated a numerical example for propagation of non-paraxial beams using the proposed angular formula. 2 The usual vectorial angular spectrum formula For monochromatic electromagnetic fields with angular frequency ω, the complex amplitudes of electric and magnetic fields are generally introduced through separating the time harmonic factor from the complex representation of electromagnetic fields. As usual, time harmonic dependence of exp(-iωt) is assumed in this paper. The complex amplitudes of electric and magnetic fields have the relations with the real field quantities as (1) { ε ( r , t ) = Re [ E ( r ) exp ( − i ω t ) ] H ( r , t ) = Re [ H ( r ) exp ( − i ω t ) ] , where E(r) and H(r) represents the complex amplitude of electric and magnetic field, respectively. E r,t) and H (r,t) are corresponding instantaneous real electric and magnetic fields. For laser beams in homogeneous medium, the complex amplitudes E(r) and H(r) can be expanded as the superposition of plane waves with different wave vector k. (2) { E ( r ) = ( 1 2 π ) 2 ∫ E ˜ ( k ⊥ ) exp ( i k ⋅ r ) d k ⊥ H ( r ) = ( 1 2 π ) 2 ∫ H ˜ ( k ⊥ ) exp ( i k ⋅ r ) d k ⊥ , where E ˜ ( k ⊥ ) and H ˜ ( k ⊥ ) are respectively the angular spectrum of complex amplitudes (E(r) and H(r)) at initial plane (z=0). The integrals at Eq. (2) are over the surface of sphere with radius of k = ωn/c in the k-space (n is the index of refraction of medium and c is the speed of light in vacuum). For convenience of calculation, Eq. (2) is generally rewritten as component forms in the Cartesian coordinate system (3) U ( x , y , z ) = ( 1 2 π ) 2 ∫ - ∞ + ∞ ∫ - ∞ + ∞ U ˜ ( k x , k y ) e i ( k x x + k y y + k z z ) d k x d k y , where U represents any Cartesian component of the electric or magnetic fields in real space, namely, Ex , Ey , Ez , Hx , Hy and Hz , while U ˜ denotes any initial angular spectrum component in the plane of z=0, i.e., E ˜ x , E ˜ y , E ˜ z , H ˜ x , H ˜ y and H ˜ z . For the case of cylindrically symmetry, Eq. (3) is usually written using cylindrical coordinate parameters (4) U ( r , φ , z ) = ( 1 2 π ) 2 ∫ 0 2 π ∫ 0 + ∞ U ˜ ( α , ϕ ) exp ( i α r cos ( ϕ − φ ) − i β z ) α d α d ϕ , where (r,φ,z) are the cylindrical coordinate parameters in real space, while (α,ϕ,β) the cylindrical coordinate parameters in k-space and obeys α2 + β 2 = k 2. Since the restriction of transverse condition k ⋅ E ˜ ( k ) = 0 (which is equivalent to zero divergence condition (∇·E =0) in spatial domain), only two components for electric field angular spectrum E ˜ ( k ) are independent. Conventionally, E ˜ x and E ˜ y are selected as independent spectral components while E ˜ 0 z is calculated by (5) E ˜ z ( k x , k y ) = k x k z E ˜ x ( k x , k y ) + k y k z E ˜ y ( k x , k y ) . The magnetic angular spectrum H ˜ ( k ) is dependent on E ˜ ( k ) due to a right-hand impedance relation between E ˜ ( k ) , H ˜ ( k ) and k. (6) H ˜ ( k ) = ε μ k × E ˜ ( k ) k . where ε and μ are respectively electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of medium. Eq. (3)–(6) represent the conventional full-vector angular spectrum formula to calculate beam propagation from two independent angular spectrum components. For a general procedure, E ˜ x and E ˜ y are firstly calculated from spatial boundary conditions at z=0 plane (i.e., Ex (x,y,0) and Ey (x,y,0)) through 2D Fourier transformation. Further, other angular spectrum components are calculated by Eq. (5) and (6). Through substituting these angular spectrum components into Eq. (3) or (4) and setting k z = k 2 − ( k x 2 + k y 2 ) = k 2 − α 2 (for α≤ k) and k z = i ( k x 2 + k y 2 ) − k 2 = i α 2 − k 2 (for α> k), the complex amplitudes of electric and magnetic fields at semi-space of z ≥0 can be solved. Although the above procedure is widely used for discussing propagation of paraxial beams, it should be careful to apply the procedure to the non-paraxial case. Due to the transverse condition, the initial angular spectral components E ˜ x and E ˜ y are restricted by the condition (7) k x E ˜ x ( k x , k y ) + k y E ˜ y ( k x , k y ) = 0 for k x 2 + k y 2 = k 2 . Otherwise, E ˜ z will tend to infinite at kz =0. The Eq. (7) presents a restriction in spectral domain for settings of initial angular spectrum components or boundary condition of fields at z=0 plane. In other words, the initial angular spectrum components or field boundary at z=0 plane are not able to be set arbitrarily. In paraxial condition, one has not to take care of the restriction since field energy hardly reach the spectral region of kz ∼0. However, for the non-paraxial case where field energy near kz ∼0 is prominent, one must to ensure initial angular spectrum to satisfy Eq. (7). For a typical example, while considering the propagation of transversely linearly-polarized Gaussian modes, the following boundary condition at z=0 plane be usually set [5,6] (8) E x ( x , y ) = E 0 exp ( − x 2 + y 2 ω 0 2 ) . This electric field distribution corresponds to a Gaussian-form angular spectrum (9) E ˜ x ( x , y ) = π ω 0 2 E 0 exp ( − ω 0 2 k x 2 + k y 2 4 ) . Evidently, Eq. (9) does not satisfy Eq. (7). If we still calculate E ˜ z using Eq. (5), the results will tend to infinite while kz tends to zero. Fig. 1 shows the x and z-components of angular spectra of Gaussian modes expressed by Eq. (8) with several different beam waist radii. From these figures, it can be seen that the of longitudinal angular spectrum ( E ˜ z ) includes spectral components with infinite amplitude at kz =0. This is not an accomplishable physically result. Although, Eq. (8) still is suitable as the boundary condition in the cases of ω 0 >>λ if ignoring the narrow singular angular spectrum region near kz ∼0 (see Fig. 1 (a)). The longitudinal angular spectrum components near kz ∼0 gradually become prominent and cannot be ignored while ω 0 < λ. In this case, the singular points at kz =0 for Eq. (5) causes a serious difficulty in analyze the propagation of beams with subwavelength-size waist. 3 Modified vectorial angular spectrum formula To avoid the singular points for longitudinal angular spectrum component at kz =0, we derived other two forms of angular spectrum formula that have no any singular points in this section. In the k-space (as shown in Fig. 2 ), E ˜ ( k ) and H ˜ ( k ) are always tangent to the surface of k-sphere with radius of k = ωn/c and can be orthogonally decomposed along inclined and azimuthal directions if we adopt spherical coordinates (k,θ,ϕ) (10a) { E ˜ ( θ , ϕ ) = E ˜ θ ( θ , ϕ ) e ˆ θ + E ˜ ϕ ( θ , ϕ ) e ˆ ϕ H ˜ ( θ , ϕ ) = ε μ E ˜ θ ( θ , ϕ ) e ˆ ϕ − ε μ E ˜ ϕ ( θ , ϕ ) e ˆ θ , where e ˆ θ and e ˆ ϕ denotes the unit vectors at inclined and azimuthal directions, respectively. E ˜ θ ( θ , ϕ ) and E ˜ ϕ ( θ , ϕ ) are the corresponding angular spectral components for electric field. Using the relation between ( e ˆ θ , e ˆ ϕ ) and the unit vectors ( e ˆ x , e ˆ y , e ˆ z ) along the Cartesian coordinate axes (11) { e ˆ θ = e ˆ x cos θ cos ϕ + e ˆ y cos θ sin ϕ − e ˆ z sin θ e ˆ ϕ = − e ˆ x sin ϕ + e ˆ y cos ϕ , the rectangular components of electric angular spectrum can be written as (12) { E ˜ x ( θ , ϕ ) = E ˜ θ ( θ , ϕ ) cos θ cos ϕ − E ˜ ϕ ( θ , ϕ ) sin ϕ E ˜ y ( θ , ϕ ) = E ˜ θ ( θ , ϕ ) cos θ sin ϕ + E ˜ ϕ ( θ , ϕ ) cos ϕ E ˜ z ( θ , ϕ ) = − E ˜ θ ( θ , ϕ ) sin θ . Since the spherical coordinates (k,θ,ϕ) have the relations with the Cartesian coordinates (kx ,ky ,kz ) (13) { sin θ = k x 2 + k y 2 k cos θ = k z k a n d { sin ϕ = k y k x 2 + k y 2 sin θ = k x 2 + k y 2 k we can rewritten the rectangular components of angular spectrum of electric field as the functions of kx , ky and kz . (14) { E ˜ x ( k x , k y ) = E ˜ θ ( k x , k y ) k z k k x k x 2 + k y 2 − E ˜ ϕ ( k x , k y ) k y k x 2 + k y 2 E ˜ y ( k x , k y ) = E ˜ θ ( k x , k y ) k z k k y k x 2 + k y 2 + E ˜ ϕ ( k x , k y ) k x k x 2 + k y 2 E ˜ z ( k x , k y ) = E ˜ θ ( k x , k y ) k x 2 + k y 2 k . Similarly, the rectangular components of magnetic angular spectrum are (15) { H ˜ x ( k x , k y ) = − ε μ E ˜ θ ( k x , k y ) k y k x 2 + k y 2 − ε μ E ˜ ϕ ( k x , k y ) k z k k x k x 2 + k y 2 H ˜ y ( k x , k y ) = ε μ E ˜ θ ( k x , k y ) k x k x 2 + k y 2 − ε μ E ˜ ϕ ( k x , k y ) k z k k y k x 2 + k y 2 H ˜ z ( k x , k y ) = ε μ E ˜ ϕ ( k x , k y ) k x 2 + k y 2 k . According to Eq. (14) and (15), any electromagnetic fields can be naturally decomposed as TE ( E ˜ θ = 0 , E ˜ ϕ ≠ 0 ) and TM ( E ˜ ϕ = 0 , E ˜ θ ≠ 0 ) modes, which is agreement with the results given by other authors [7,10–13]. The TE modes have the non-zero field components (Ex , Ey , Hx , Hy , Hz ) and TM modes have the non-zero field components (Ex , Ey , Ez , Hx , Hy ). Although Eq. (14) and (15) are convenient to discuss the TE or TM modes, it is not intuitive to relate the angular spectrum representation with usual linearly-polarized modes in paraxial condition. If we introduce two new functions by (16) { E ˜ 1 ( k x , k y ) = E ˜ θ ( k x , k y ) k x k x 2 + k y 2 − E ˜ ϕ ( k x , k y ) k k z k y k x 2 + k y 2 E ˜ 2 ( k x , k y ) = E ˜ θ ( k x , k y ) k y k x 2 + k y 2 + E ˜ ϕ ( k x , k y ) k k z k x k x 2 + k y 2 Then we can change Eq. (14) to a simple form (17) { E ˜ x ( k x , k y ) = E ˜ 1 ( k x , k y ) k z k E ˜ y ( k x , k y ) = E ˜ 2 ( k x , k y ) k z k E ˜ z ( k x , k y ) = − E ˜ 1 ( k x , k y ) k x k − E ˜ 2 ( k x , k y ) k y k . The angular spectrum formula (17) are slightly different from usually-used angular spectrum formula (Eq. (5)). Nevertheless, they give the same result in paraxial limitation (kz → k). It is noted that the angular spectra expressed by Eq. (17) show a key advantage of no singular points. Unlike E ˜ x and E ˜ y are restricted by Eq. (7), we can arbitrarily set initial angular spectrum E ˜ 1 and E ˜ 2 . According to Eq. (17), the electromagnetic waves can be decomposed into two modes with transverse linearly-polarized electric fields: LPx( E ˜ 2 = 0 ) and LPy ( E ˜ 1 = 0 ) modes. The LPx mode have the non-zero field components (Ex , Ez , Hx , Hy , Hz ) and LPy modes have the non-zero field components (Ey , Ez , Hx , Hy , Hz ). In paraxial limitation, these two modes corresponds to usual orthogonal linearly polarized modes in x and y directions. As an example of calculating propagation of beams with subwavelength-size spot applying Eq. (17) and Eq. (3), we set E ˜ 2 ( k x , k y ) = 0 and (18) E ˜ 1 ( k x , k y ) = π ω 0 2 E 0 exp ( − ω 0 2 k x 2 + k y 2 4 ) . In paraxial limitation, Eq. (18) corresponds to Gaussian beams linearly-polarized along x direction, as described by Eq. (8). Fig. 3 shows the angular spectra and corresponding spatial field distributions (z=0) of the non-paraxial linearly-polarized Gaussian beams with subwavelength beam waist (ω 0 ≤ λ). The fields demonstrated in these figures strictly obey Maxwell’s equations because no any field components or spectral components are ignored in the calculation. From these figures, it is noted that spatial distributions of the transverse field component is remarkable deviated from the Gaussian distribution while ω 0 < λ and the longitudinal field component becomes gradually prominent with decreasing of ω 0. The results for subwavelength cases are considerably different from the paraxial Gaussian beams. 4 Conclusions In summary, we proposed other two forms of full vector angular spectrum formula, which have the same asymptotic forms in paraxial limitation as usual angular spectrum formula. For the first form, laser fields are naturally decomposed into transverse electric (TE) and magnetic (TM) modes. For the second form, laser fields are the superposition of two transversely linear-polarized modes (LPx and LPy). Comparing with usual forms of angular spectrum formula, our formulae have not any singular points for longitudinal angular spectral components at kz =0. As a result, the full-vector angular spectrum formulae presented by this paper are suitable to discuss analytically and calculate numerically the propagation of non-paraxial beams with subwavelength-size waist, including contributions from all field components and full angular spectrum components.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.107,Systematic analysis on linear and nonlinear optical traits of citrulline doped NH4H2PO4 (ADP) crystal,"Abstract The current investigation is aimed to explore the optical properties of citrulline doped ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4,ADP) crystal by employing crystal growth, structural, UV–vis, Kurtz-Perry test and Z-scan characterization techniques.

As identified nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal, ADP crystal offers excellent second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency having the d 36 coefficient 1.38×10−9 esu [5]. It is mind boggling fact that in very short span of time ADP has gained much attention and eventually subjected to rigorous investigations for further development as trailed in available literature. The researchers exploring the growth of single/bulk crystal by different techniques [6–8] and by doping selected additives [9] shed more light on the developments that have been achieved in recent past in case of ADP crystal. The literature survey reveals that the modus operandi of doping an organic additive is most influential approach in order to achieve higher enhancement in characteristic properties of ADP crystal. Thereby the doping of several amino acids namely L-valine [10], L-asparginine [11], L-lysine [12], glycine [13,14], L-alanine [15], L-arginene [16], L-proline [17], L-cysteine [18] in ADP crystal has been extensively studied. The results revealed that the performance of amino acid doped ADP crystal capitalizes the undoped ADP crystal in terms of linear and nonlinear optical properties. In addition authors want to notify that our research group is the first to report the doping of L-citrulline in ADP crystal and uncover its effect on optical properties. These factors encouraged our research group to investigate the doping effect of l-citrulline on linear and nonlinear properties of ADP crystal and explore its importance for distinct NLO device applications. 2 Experimental procedure The AR grade ADP salt was dissolved in double distilled water with constant stirring to achieve the supersaturated solution. The saturated solution of ADP was added with 0.2mol percent of L-citrulline separately. The mixture was allowed to stir with constant speed for eight hours to avoid co-precipitation at different stages and procure the homogeneous solution. The solution was gradually filtered using No.1whatman filter paper in a clean rinsed beaker and the solution was later kept for slow evaporation at room temperature. The 0.2mol percent of L-citrulline doped ADP crystal was grown by slow evaporation technique. The as grown citrulline doped ADP crystal is shown in Fig. 1 a. 3 Results and discussion The structural analysis of pure and citrulline doped ADP crystal has been performed by means of single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The structural details were experimentally determined at room temperature using the Enraf Nonius CAD4 single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The XRD data comprised in Table 1 reveals that the pure and citrulline doped ADP crystal belongs to tetragonal crystal system with I42d space group. It is noticeable that the unit cell parameters of ADP crystal show slight modification when doped with citrulline. This might have been evolved due to the effective strain developed by dopant on lattice of ADP crystal. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmittance spectrum of citrulline doped ADP crystal shown in Fig. 1b has been recorded in the range of 500–4000cm−1 using the Bruker α-ATR spectrophotometer. The presence of functional groups evidenced at different wavenumber has been evaluated to confirm the incorporation of citrulline in ADP crystal matrix. The absorption attributed at 544cm−1 is attributed by CO rocking vibrations of dopant citrulline. The COH bending vibration associated with citrulline is contributed at 675cm−1. The POH bond stretching vibration is evident at 922cm−1. The absorption peak observed at 1527cm−1 is associated with the CCN bending vibration. The vibration of characteristic CO bond is observed at 1695cm−1. The OH bond stretching vibration associated with phosphate group is evident at 2344cm-1. The OH bond stretching vibration is contributed at wavenumber 3618cm−1, 3744cm−1, 3838cm−1. Linear optical transmittance in crystal is governed by the electronic transition relying on the absorption of incident photon of specific energy subject to light-matter interaction. The other factors that affects the transmittance of crystal are (a) crystal orientation [19], (b) optically involved functional groups [20] and (c) scattering/absorption by associated defects centers (impurities, voids, inclusions, striations, grain boundaries) [21,22]. In present analysis the optical transmittance of undoped and citrulline doped ADP crystals of 2mm thickness has been ascertained in the range of 200–900nm using the Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer and the traced optical spectrum is shown in Fig. 2 a. The observation of spectrum reveals that the ADP crystal has the transmittance of 80% and citrulline doped ADP crystal has transmittance of 89% in entire visible region. The addition of amino acid with wide bonding network favors optical homogeneity and strengthens the crystal structure by minimizing the defect density. In case of citrulline doped ADP crystal the enhancement in transmittance might have been attributed by minimized scattering/absorption of light from defect centers, similar results are evident in many amino acid doped crystals [23–25]. The citrulline doped ADP crystal with high optical transmittance might find huge applications in designing devices utilized in frequency conversion and other parametric processes [26,27]. The material lacking uniform molecular orientation in structural design facilitates origin of significant frequency doubling phenomenon which enables its utility for SHG device applications. Therefore, in current investigation the standard Kurtz-Perry powder test [28] has been employed to determine the SHG efficiency of grown crystals. The good quality single crystals were selected and powdered to micro-granules of uniform size. The powdered sample of each crystal was tightly packed in the quartz cavity and placed at the sample holder position. In order to begin the analysis the Gaussian filtered beam of Q-switched mode operated Nd:YAG laser (1064nm, 6ns, 10Hz) was made incident on each sample and the respective intensity offered by the sample was collected through the optical fiber attached to the spectrophotometer (Black BS Stellernet). The observed green emission confirmed the second order NLO behavior and the intensity dependent SHG response is shown in Fig. 2b. It reveals that the SHG efficiency of citrulline doped ADP crystal is much higher relative to standard KDP crystal material which is 2.18 times higher than the KDP crystal. The SHG efficiency is comparable to the citrulline doped KDP crystal which is 2.2 times higher than KDP crystal material [29]. The SHG efficiency of citrulline doped ADP crystal is systematically compared in Table 2 . Thus citrulline doped KDP crystal could be suitable candidate for fabricating frequency convertor devices [30]. The optical nonlinearities originating at high power laser intensities is the most appealing topic that holds huge technological impetus for manufacturing ultrafast optical processing devices. In present investigation the third order nonlinear optical (TONLO) effects attributed by the grown crystal has been investigated employing the sensitive Z-scan technique developed by Bahae et al. [31]. The grown crystal is well polished to 0.5mm thickness and placed at the focus (Z=0) position of the optical distance reaching to photo-detector. The Z-scan system was initially configured to close aperture and the Gaussian filtered beam was focused on the crystal surface. The crystal sample was translated along the complete Z-direction ranging from −15mm to 15mm and the transmitted intensity with reference to position was traced using the photo detector place at far field. The closed aperture Z-scan transmittance of citrulline doped ADP crystal is shown in Fig. 2c. It is observed that the grown crystal attributes the pre-focus peak to post-focus valley evidencing the signature of negative optical nonlinear refraction [32]. The occurrence of negative refraction indicates that the grown crystal belongs to the category of self-defocusing materials significant for optical sensing devices [33]. The phase shift from peak to valley depicts that the irradiation of laser beam facilitates the spacial distribution of optical energy along the surface giving rise to thermal lensing effect [34,35]. The ΔF (on axis phase shift) can be derived in terms of ΔTp-v (peak to valley transmittance difference) as [31], (1) Δ T p − v = 0.406 ( 1 − S ) 0.25 | Δ ϕ | where S=[1-exp (-2ra 2/ωa 2)] is the aperture linear transmittance, ra is the aperture radius and ωa is the beam radius at the aperture. The magnitude of nonlinear refractive index (n2) was calculated using the relation [31], (2) n 2 = Δ ϕ K I 0 L e f f where K=2π/λ (λ is the laser wavelength), I0 is the intensity of the laser beam at the focus (Z=0),Leff =[1-exp (-αL)]/α, is the effective thickness of the sample depending on linear absorption coefficient (α) and L thickness of the sample. The n2 of citrulline doped ADP crystal is thus found to be of order of 10−15 cm2/W. The TONLO absorption coefficient (β) has been measured from the open aperture Z-scan configuration. The open aperture Z-scan transmittance curve of grown crystal is Fig. 2d. It reveals that the crystal offers maximum transmittance at the focus position depicting the presence of saturable absorption (SA) phenomenon [36]. The SA effect is dwelled due to dominance of ground state linear absorption over the excited state absorption [37]. The β value of grown crystal has been evaluated using the equation [31], (3) β = 2 2 Δ T I 0 L e f f where ΔT is the one valley value at the open aperture Z-scan curve. The grown crystal offers the β of order 10−4 cm/W. The susceptibility in the material assists the polarization to be more effective at high power laser intensities. Therefore, the TONLO susceptibility (χ(3)) of grown crystal has been evaluated using the equations below [31], (4) Re χ ( 3 ) ( e s u ) = 10 − 4 ( ε 0 C 2 n 0 2 n 2 ) / π ( c m 2 / W ) (5) Im χ ( 3 ) ( e s u ) = 10 − 2 ( ε 0 C 2 n 0 2 λ β ) / 4 π 2 ( c m / W ) (6) χ ( 3 ) = ( R e χ ( 3 ) ) 2 + ( I m χ ( 3 ) ) 2 where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, n0 is the linear refractive index of the sample and c is the velocity of light in vacuum. The susceptibility in the crystal is attributed by the extended π-bonding network of the material and the high magnitude of χ(3) is most needed parameter for achieving high polarizing capability of material [38–40]. The order of χ(3) of grown crystal is found to be of order 10−4 esu. The optical resolution of Z-scan setup is given in Table 3 and the magnitude of TONLO parameters of citrulline doped ADP crystal are compared with literature in Table 4 . The appealing TONLO parameters of grown crystal might be advantageous for applications in 3D optical data storage, optical switching, photodynamic therapy, lithography microscopic fabrication, optical limiting and fluorescence excitation microscopy/imaging devices [41]. 4 Conclusion The citrulline doped ADP single crystal of dimension 19×15×04mm3 has been successfully grown by slow solvent evaporation technique. The crystal structure has been ascertained by single crystal XRD analysis while the coordination and incorporation of citrulline in ADP has been confirmed by FTIR analysis. The linear optical studies established the presence of high optical transmittance of citrulline doped ADP crystal within 200–900nm which is found 9% higher than ADP crystal. The promising NLO behavior of citrulline doped ADP crystal has been confirmed by Kurtz-Perry test and Z-scan analysis. The frequency doubling effect i.e. SHG efficiency of citrulline doped ADP crystal is found to be 2.18 times higher than KDP crystal material. In TONLO studies the physical origin of negative nonlinear refraction and saturable absorption phenomenon expressed at 632.8nm by citrulline doped ADP crystal has been explained. The magnitude of TONLO refraction, absorption coefficient and susceptibility of citrulline doped ADP crystal is found to be 4.61×10−15 cm2/W, 4.11×10−4 cm/W, 7.71×10−4 esu respectively. All above studies infer that the citrulline doped ADP crystal is potential optical crystal which holds strong candidature for designing various optical devices.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.033,Singlemode-multimode-singlemode fiber structure as compressive strain sensor on a reinforced concrete beam,"Abstract In this paper, we demonstrate a single-mode–multimode–single-mode (SMS) fiber structure to measure compressive strain in the elastic regime of a reinforced concrete beam. The fabrication method used to produce a 3.12m reinforced concrete beam that met the Euro code (EC2) requirements was also demonstrated in this work. Strain measurement via the SMS sensor was calibrated using an electrical resistance strain gauge and a data logger to obtain accurate measurements of the strain. A linear transmission spectral red shift was observed as the strain value was increased from 0mm/mm to 0.000116mm/mm. Hence, the SMS sensor could provide a sensitivity of 3778.1nm/(mm/mm) with a linearity of 0.9661.",Feb-18," Keywords Reinforced concrete beam Strain measurement Singlemodemultimode-singlemode (SMS) fiber structure 1 Introduction The term structural health monitoring (SHM) refers to the process used to investigate the protocol of the damage mode in many structural or infrastructural buildings, aerospace, and so on [1]. After extreme events, such as landslides and earthquakes, SHM is used to monitor conditions and targets in real time and produce valid information about the structural integrity of buildings. The sensor is the most crucial component in SHM because it detects local damage, such as crack openings, bonding in the structure, and deformations in the civil structure. Most SHM systems use convocational sensing technologies, such as electrical resistance strain sensors, vibration wire strain gauges, and piezoelectric accelerometers. Although these sensors have been used in civil structures for many years, because of their inability to resist electromagnetic wave interference (EMI), water shorting and corrosion, alternative methods are required. In the past, the application of fiber optic sensors (FOS) in civil structures was well developed due to its ability to overcome weaknesses in electrical based sensors [2]. FOS have several advantages, such as its small size, low cost, and the absence of electromagnetic interference, which makes them competitive with other technologies. Optical sensors based on Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) are the most commonly used fiber sensor for testing and monitoring applications. FBG sensor is constructed by writing Bragg gratings into fiber core. However, this process requires careful handling to avoid mechanical instability. In addition, FBG sensor also requires additional optical interrogator to obtain highly precise peak shift measurement which can be expensive and complex. Recently, multimode interference occurring in a single-mode–multimode–single-mode (SMS) fiber structure was investigated. It was successfully demonstrated as a temperature sensor, load sensor, displacement sensor, bandpass filter, and refractometer sensor [3–8]. SMS based sensors offers favorable advantages such as simple configuration, low cost fabrication and wide measurement range with good sensitivity. SMS based sensor has much simpler configuration as its structure consisting of two single mode fibers (SMF) spliced at both ends of the multimode fiber (MMF). When a broadband light source is injected into the SMS structure, a modulated transmission spectrum is produced by multimode excitation, multimode interference, and light recoupling from the MMF into the SMF. The multimode interference pattern can be changed when a strain is applied to the MMF [8,9]. This allows the SMS to serve as an optical sensor in which shifts in peak transmission wavelength are observed. In this paper, we present an investigation of the SMS fiber structure to measure the compressive strain on a reinforced concrete beam. Although previous works have used a simple structure such as steel beam [10] and cantilever beam [11], our work is the first to test an SMS fiber structure using a reinforced concrete beam. 2 Casting of reinforced concrete beam In our work, we designed and fabricated a reinforced concrete beam that complied with the Euro code (EC2) requirements. Fig. 1 shows cross-sectional and side views of the beam; all dimensions are in millimeters (mm). As the figure shows, the beam is 3120mm long, 250mm high, and 150mm wide. The concrete beam is reinforced by the use of shear links to carry diagonal shear forces. Twenty-one R6 steel stirrups are arranged at intervals of 150mm. In addition, the beam is reinforced by longitudinal steel bars: two T10 steel bars are located at the top of the cross section, and 3 T10 steel bars are located at the bottom of the cross section. Concrete was prepared by mixing granite, sand, water, and cement with calculated proportion as shown in Table 1 . The diameter of the granite ranged from 5 to 20mm, and the diameter of the river sand diameter was less than 4.75mm. Portland cement, which is commonly available in Malaysia, was mixed by adding water in a concrete mixer. The ratio of cement-to-sand was 0.458, and the ratio of water to cement (W/C) was 0.575. The slump test was conducted on the concrete mixture, in which a slump of 80mm was obtained. The fresh concrete then was cast in a steel mold; a steel cage was installed accordingly inside the mold. The concrete was compacted by using a vibrator. The concrete beam after the casting was complete whereupon it was demolded after one week. Concrete strength was achieved by casting 12 cube samples with 100×100×100mm per unit. Three samples of cylinders 200mm in height and 100 in diameter were cast to use in the splitting test, which was conducted on the same day that the beam test was performed. The concrete beam and the samples were cured by water for 28days. The average compressive concrete strength was 37.67MPa in the cubes, and the average tensile strength was 3.03MPa in the cylinder samples. 3 Experimental setup The experimental setup used to measure the compressive strain on the fabricated reinforced concrete beam is presented in Fig. 2 . An Instron universal testing machine with a 2000kN static load capacity was used to apply a compressive load at the center of the load beam. The load was distributed by two point loads at the top and the mid-span of the reinforced concrete beam. The distance between the two point loads was 1m. The reinforced concrete beam was supported over a clear span of 2.82m on the hinged end and the roller end. The overhang at each end was 0.15m as shown in Fig. 2. An electrical resistance (ER) strain gauge was attached on the top surface of the beam at mid-span using a cyanoacrylate adhesive. Thermoplastic adhesive was then used to cover the top part of the gauge. The ER strain gauge was connected to a data logger in order to read and record the strain values. In our work, an SMS fiber was used to verify the optical fiber sensor performance to measure different strains on the reinforced concrete beam. The SMS fiber structure was formed by fusion splicing a multimode fiber (MMF) with single-mode fiber (SMF-28) connected to both terminals. The MMF had a step index profile with a core/cladding diameter of 105/125μm. A MMF 6.8cm in length was chosen because of its convenience in fiber splicing. The SMS is properly aligned in a straight manner at the mid-span position on the top surface of the reinforced concrete beam using a tape meter to ensure accurate measurement. The SMS is fixed on the beam using epoxy adhesive to provide strong adhesion. An amplified spontaneous (ASE) light source at the C-band wavelength was used as a light source, and an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA, Aritsu MS9710C) was used to capture spectral changes at the output of the sensor. Fig. 3 shows a photo image of the equipment and tools used to conduct the experiment at the Civil Engineering Laboratory at the University of Malaya, Malaysia. The enclosed laboratory was regulated with temperature at 24°C throughout the experiment. In order to apply and increase the amount of strain to the beam, the main applied load was increased from 0kN and then gradually increased at the rate of 1.0kN/min up to 31kN. The maximum amount of load applied ensured that the elasticity of the beam was maintained. Measurement was firstly taken without any strain applied (zero loading) in order to compensate the effect of temperature changes to avoid strain measurement error. However, the effect of the temperature is negligible when compared with the wavelength shift by strain. The ER strain gauge and the SMS sensor measurements were simultaneously recorded for comparison when different loads were applied. 4 Results and discussion The bandpass transmission spectrum of the SMS at 0kN loading is shown in Fig. 4 . It was captured at an OSA resolution of 0.1nm and a span of 50nm. When the light propagating from SMF to the MMF section, a number of guided modes are excited which multimode interference in MMF leads to the formation of self-imaging of the input field along the MMF section before entering the output SMF. Therefore, the response of the SMS is a bandpass spectrum, which the central wavelength of the spectrum is dependent on the MMF length. The measured spectral response of the SMS fiber structure, which was measured at the same OSA settings for various compressive loads, is shown in Fig. 5 . The graph shows that both the peak wavelength and the power of the spectra changed as the load was increased (Fig. 5). Fig. 6 shows the relation between the peak wavelength and compressive strain sensed by the ER strain gauge at different loads. The compressive strain measured by the strain gauge was processed by a data logger. The maximum strain value of 0.000116mm/mm was applied to the beam with an input compressive load of 31kN. As the graph shows, the peak of the bandpass transmission spectrum shifted to a longer wavelength as the load was increased. The sensitivity of 0.014nm/kN with a linearity of 0.97676 was obtained by the SMS sensor, and a sensitivity of 0.0000037(mm/mm)/kN with a linearity of 0.97511 was obtained by the ER strain gauge. Moreover, as the load was increased, the measured peak power was observed to decrease at a slope of −0.1089nW/kN and a linearity of 0.99795 as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 8 illustrates the relation between the spectral peak center wavelength and the compressive strain. It was observed that the curve was linearly increased with the increments of compressive strain at a slope of 3778.1nm/(mm/mm) and a linearity of 0.9661. 5 Conclusion This experimental work demonstrated that a simple SMS fiber structure was capable of measuring the strain in a reinforced concrete beam, which is a heavy and rigid civil structure. This work also demonstrated the method used to fabricate a reinforced concrete beam that complied with the Euro code (EC2) standard. The results showed that the SMS fiber sensor provided a sensitivity of 3778.1nm/(mm/mm) and a linearity of 0.9661 in compressive strain measurements to a maximum of 0.000116mm/mm. ", [1] H.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.040,The optical properties of GaN (001)surface modified by intrinsic defects from density functional theory calculation,"Abstract Based on the first principle density functional theory calculation, the effect of two kinds of intrinsic point defects on the optical properties of GaN polar surface was investigated in this paper. It was found that the band gap and the positions of the electronic states changed with the presence of defects, resulting in a change in the optical properties. The static dielectric function decreased slightly, the numbers and the positions of the peaks in the imaginary part of dielectric function change a lot, the intensity of the absorption spectrum decreased, significant of shrinking of the absorption spectrum was observed, and the electron energy loss spectra peak broadened along with the decrease in the peak height. In the case of the GaN polar surface with the N vacancy, the range of the absorption spectrum comprised the visible light, and the presence of the N vacancy resulted in a low energy plasma excitation peak.",Feb-18," Keywords GaN polar surface Intrinsic defect Density of state Optical property 1 Introduction Gallium nitride (GaN) is a III–V compound semiconductor material, and a typical representative of third generation semiconductor materials. Owing to its wide direct band gap, large thermal conductivity, high breakdown voltage, high temperature resistance, and good physical and chemical stability [1–3], GaN has broad application prospects for the development of blue Light Emitting Diodes (LED), blue lasers, ultraviolet (UV) detectors, and so on [4,5]. In recent years, through the first principle density functional theory, considerable theoretical efforts have been made in order to gain insight into the physical processes on GaN [6–8]. Ji et al. has investigated the electronic structure and optical properties of GaN surface with Si doping,the results show that the absorption and reflection to ultraviolet are subdued, so Ga(Si)N material is more suitable for UV detection [9]. Cs adsorption on (100) surface of [001]-oriented GaN nanowires was studied by Sihao Xia et al.,the results show that Cs adsorption can greatly reduce the work function of GaN nanowire, Cs will lose electrons and electrons mostly transfer to surface Ga atoms [10]. Guerrero-Sánchez et al. has studied YN nanostructure formation on the GaN (0001) surface,the results show that the most stable configurations correspond to the Y adsorption at the T4 site, and the YN bilayers are in the wurtzite-like phase with the surface showing metallic characteristics [11]. Electronic structure of Al0.25Ga0.75N (0001) surfaces covered with different coverage of cesium were studied by Mingzhu Yang et al.,the results show that the density of states (DOS) at Fermi level increases by the joint effort of Cs 5s and 5p state electrons, which improves the conductivity of the surface and results in semi-metallic properties [12]. Defects, that are formed during the growth process of GaN, may interact with carriers and affect the optical properties of GaN, subsequently affecting the performances of photoelectric devices. Six kinds of intrinsic defects have been observed in GaN: N vacancy, Ga vacancy, N clearance, Ga clearance, substitution of N by Ga, and substitution of Ga by N. In the present study, the effects of point defects on the optical properties of GaN polar surfaces were studied by considering the case of substitution of Ga by N and N vacancy defects. Furthermore, the reasons for the changes in the optical properties were analyzed. 2 Theoretical model and calculation method 2.1 Theoretical model The ideal GaN crystal exhibits the hexagonal wurtzite structure, a 4×4 super-cell of the bulk GaN structure (four Ga-N layers) was constructed. To model the GaN (001) surface, the bulk GaN structure was cleaved along the (001) surface, the top two layers of this slab model were relaxed freely, the bottom two layers were fixed, at least a 1.3nm vacuum thickness was used to avoid the interaction between each other, and the dangling bonds at the bottom surface were saturated by pseudo-hydrogen atoms as shown in Fig. 1 (a). A 15Å wide vacuum region perpendicular to the GaN (001) surface was added, which was confirmed to be appropriate (based on the average electrostatic potential plot). Fig. 1(b) and (c) shows the GaN (001) surface structures with the substitution of Ga by N and N vacancy defects, a Ga atom was replaces by a N atom or a N atom was removed in the outermost layer, the defect concentration was 3.125%. The constructed structures were optimized to achieve the steady state. 2.2 Calculation method In this paper, the CASTEP (Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package) module is adopted to calculate intrinsic point defects in GaN material using the first principles. Simulations are performed under generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange and correlation. The Brillouin-zone (BZ) integration is calculated by the highly symmetric K points in the form of a Monkhorst-Pack 7×7×1 grid. In the process of structure optimization, 500eV mesh cutoff energy is set for the expansion of plane wave basis sets and the convergence criteria was set to energy change below 2×10−6 eV/atom for all systems, force less than 0.02eV/nm, the convergence tolerance of a single atomic energy below 1×10−5 eV/atom, stress less than 0.05GPa, and change in displacement of atoms less than 1×10−3 Å. All calculations are carried in reciprocal space with Ga:3d104s24p1 and N:2s22p3. The optical properties of any system are in general evaluated with the help of frequency dependent complex dielectric function. ε(ω)=ε1(ω)+iε2(ω), where the real part ε1 =n2-k2, the imaginary part ε2 =2nk, n represents reflection coefficient and k represents extinction coefficient. The imaginary part ε2 is computed with the help of first order time dependent perturbation theory in the simple dipole approximation. In the long wavelength limit, the real part and imaginary part of the ε(ω) are given by: (1) ε 1 = 1 + c 2 ∑ V , C ∫ B Z d 3 K 2 2 p | e M C V ( K ) | 2 [ E C ( K ) - E V ( K ) ] h 3 [ E C ( K ) - E V ( K ) ] 2 - h 2 w 2 (2) ε 2 = c 1 2 w 2 ∑ V , C ∫ B Z d 3 K 2 ( 2 p ) 2 | e M C V ( K ) | 2 d [ E C ( K ) - E V ( K ) - h w ] where C and V represent conduction band and valence band respectively, BZ represents the first brillouin zone, ℏis planck's constant, K is electronic wave vector, eMCV(K)2 is defined as the matrix elements of momentum transition, ω is angular frequency, c1 and c2 are defined as constants, EC(K) and EV(K) represent intrinsic energy level on the conduction band and valence band respectively. The complex refractive index (Ñ) of a material is related to ε(ω) by the relation Ñ2 =ε(ω). On simplification one can obtain the real part as well as the imaginary part of the refractive index in the form of Ñ(ω)=n(ω)+ik(ω), where, (3) n ( w ) = ( e 1 2 + e 2 2 + e 1 2 ) 1 2 (4) k ( w ) = ( e 1 2 + e 2 2 - e 1 2 ) 1 2 With the magnitude of n(ω) and k(ω), one can further compute the reflectivity (5) R ( w ) = ( n - 1 ) 2 + k 2 ( n + 1 ) 2 + k 2 The absorption coefficient can also be evaluated using the formula, (6) a ( w ) = 2 k w c h Where c represents the speed of light in vacuum and ω is in energy unit.The electron energy loss spectra (EELS) is a direct measurement of the collective excitation of a system which is given by the relation L(ω)=Im(−1/ε(ω)). On simplification it becomes, (7) L ( w ) = ε 2 ε 1 2 + ε 2 2 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Density of states The total DOS and partial DOS have been depicted in Fig. 2 . By comparing the N vacancy defect structure with the pristine GaN polar surface, the Fermi level moves to the high-energy area and comes into the conduction band for the existence of N vacancy, which shows n-type semiconductor conductive properties as in the results of Refs. [13] and [14]. At the same time, the N 2s-and N 2p-state electrons move to low-energy area, so do the Ga 3d-, Ga4 s- and Ga 4p-state electrons. The reason for this change is that the vacancy causes partial changes of the electronic structures of the vacancy neighbor and next neighbor atoms. For the GaN polar surface with N substitute Ga defect, the conduction and valence bands have been linked together, which means that the band gap has disappeared. The electronic states of Ga and N atoms have a slight movement toward the low-energy direction. 3.2 Optical properties The optical properties of photoelectric materials are mainly characterized by the dielectric function, optical absorption spectra, conductivity, loss function, refractive index and reflection coefficient. The optical constants, relating the microscopic model of physical process with the microelectronic structure of the solid that can better characterize the physical properties of the material, are mainly determined by the electronic structures and the carrier concentration near the Fermi level. The changes in the electronic structures of GaN caused by the defects of substitution of Ga by N and N vacancy would influence its optical properties. The optical properties of the three different polar surface structures of GaN (pristine, Ga substituted by N, and N vacancy) are depicted in Fig. 3 . 3.2.1 Dielectric function and optical absorption Within the linear response range, the structure of the energy band of a solid and other kinds of spectral information can be obtained from the dielectric function, which associates the micro-physical process of inter-band transition with the electronic structure of the solid. The spectra of the GaN semiconductor material were produced by electronic transitions between bands. Each dielectric peak can be explained by band structures and density of states of GaN. In the dielectric function, the decline of the real part determines the peak value of the imaginary part, and the imaginary part represents the optical absorption intensity. Fig. 3(a) and (b) represents the frequency dependent real and imaginary parts of ε(ω) of the three different polar surface structures of GaN. For the pristine GaN polar surface, the static dielectric function ε1(0) was found to be 3.44, the maximum value of the real part was 4.17 at the optical frequency of 3.9eV, and the minimum value was found to be −0.57 at the optical frequency of 11.7eV. With an increase in the optical frequency, the real part decreased rapidly in the range of 3.9–11.7eV, which indicates that the imaginary part increased rapidly in this range. However, fluctuation in the trend of the imaginary part were also observed at certain points within this range. The main peaks of ε2(ω) corresponds to the specific inter-band transition. Five main peaks were observed in the graph of ε2(ω) at optical frequencies of 2.72, 6.84,8.56, 10.70, and 13.42eV. The peak at 2.72eV corresponds to the transition of N 2p state (upper valence band) to Ga 4s state, the peaks at 6.84 and 8.56eV indicate the transitions of N 2s state (lower valence band) to Ga 4s and Ga 4p states respectively, and the peaks at 10.70 and 13.42eV correspond to the transitions of Ga 4p state to N 2s and N 2p states respectively. Fig. 3(c) shows the absorption coefficients of the three different structures of GaN. As can be seen from the figure, the maximum value of the absorption coefficient is 213000cm−1 at the optical frequency of 11.34eV and the optical range of absorption spectra is 2.2–29.3eV. The absorption edge begins at the optical frequency of 1.66eV, which corresponds to the direct transition threshold and is in agreement with Refs [15]. This is caused by the electronic transition from the top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band. After the introduction of N substitution of Ga and N vacancy defects into the GaN polar surface, the static dielectric function ε1(0) decreased slightly, the numbers and the positions of the peaks of ε2(ω) that represent the transition change significantly, the intensity of the absorption spectrum decreased, and significant of shrinking of the absorption spectrum in the high energy region was observed. In the case of the GaN polar surface with Ga substituted by N, ε1(0) was found to be 1.97. The change in the peak of ε2(ω) indicates change in the interband transition, which is caused by the change in the electronic states. Only three peaks were observed in the graph of ε2(ω), which correspond to the transitions of N 2p state (upper valence band) to Ga 4s state, N 2s state (lower valence band) to Ga 4s state, and Ga 4p state to N 2p state. The maximum value of the absorption coefficient was 60,200cm−1 at the optical frequency of 6.58eV. The optical range of the absorption spectra was separated into two parts ranging from 1.9 to 11.46eV and 16.8 to 18.9eV and the absorption peak moved to the lower energy region. The absorption edge was observed at the optical frequency of 1.9eV, which indicates the red shift of the absorption edge. In the case of the GaN polar surface with the N vacancy defect, ε1(0) was determined to be 3.15. The shift in the absorption spectra towards the lower energy region is more evident in this case, and the range of the absorption spectrum comprised the visible light region (1.57–3.18eV). In addition, a new absorption peak appeared in the low energy region, this is because the N vacancy defect caused changes in the electronic structures of its neighboring atoms. 3.2.2 Reflectivity and refractive index The real part of the refractive index n(ω) was computed using Eq. (3), and the results are shown in Fig. 3(d). The static value of refractive index n(0) of the pristine GaN polar surface was 1.86, and the maximum value of its real part was 2.07 at the optical frequency of 4.02eV. The absorption of the high-frequency electromagnetic wave decreased with increase in the photon energy above 20eV, and the change in the refractive index was observed to be very small. In the case of the GaN polar surface with Ga substituted by N, the maximum value of n(ω) was found to be 1.56 at the optical energy of 2.01eV, which indicates a shift in the peak position to the low frequency region. The range of the optical frequency of n(ω) decreased in the high frequency region. In the case of the GaN polar surface with the N vacancy defect, the trend of the changes was the same as that of the GaN polar surface with Ga substituted by N; however, the magnitude of the changes was more pronounced. The optical parameter corresponding to the refractive index is reflectivity R(ω), which can be computed by Eq. (5). From Fig. 3(e), the maximum value of reflectivity of the pristine GaN polar surface was 0.36 at the optical frequency of 15.4eV. The reflectivity observed at optical energies above 28eV was very small. In the case of the GaN polar surface with the defects of Ga substituted by N and N vacancy, the maximum value of R(ω) became smaller and apparently shifted toward the low frequency region. In addition, the optical frequency range was reduced to values less than 15eV. 3.2.3 Electron energy loss function The electron energy loss function (EELS) describes the energy loss of electrons in a homogeneous medium. The peak value of the function represents plasma turbulence, and the corresponding oscillation frequency is known as the plasma frequency. The EELS was computed using Eq. (7), and the results are shown in Fig. 3(f). A single sharp peak of height 5.2 was observed at 15.9eV for the pristine GaN polar surface; this peak position corresponds to the edge energy of plasma and indicates the transition point of the material from metallic to dielectric properties. In the cases of the GaN polar surface with the defects of Ga substituted by N and N vacancy, the EELS peak broadened and the height of the peak decreased significantly, and the peak position shifted to the low energy region. Furthermore, a new peak was observed in the frequency region below 1.86eV for the GaN polar surface with the N vacancy defect. This indicates that the presence of N vacancy in the GaN polar surface gives rise to a low energy plasma excitation peak. 4 Summary In our work the optical properties of GaN polar surface with the two kinds of intrinsic point defects were calculated through the first principle density functional theory. The influence of Ga substituted by N and N vacancy defects on the optical properties of GaN (001) surface was mainly concentrated in the low-energy region and get weak in the high-energy region. The peak position of the dielectric function shifted to the low frequency region, which increases the electronic transitions in visible light region. Furthermore, the absorption to visible light and even infrared light is enhanced in the presence of N vacancy, which is suitable for the longer wave light detection instead of UV detection.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.079,Active cancellation method of the chirp-subpulse stepped frequency (CSSF) based on repeater jamming,"Abstract This paper presents an active cancellation method based on repeater jamming to weaken the incident wave rather than to weaken the scattered wave in conventional method. The method works well on chirp-subpulse stepped frequency (CSSF) signal. The incident plane wave is interfered by a spherical wave which is generated by a horizontal electric dipole. The analysis and simulation show that the plane wave can be reduced obviously via this method. By incorporating frequency and phase modulation, the backscattering of the target is reduced significantly. Numerical experiments also show that with greater wavelength, the cancellation performance gets better.",Feb-18," Keywords Cancellation Repeater jamming Spherical wave Chirp-subpulse stepped frequency (CSSF) Matched filter 1 Introduction The active cancellation's original concept came from Paul Leug, who proposed this method to control the noise as early as 1933. The method reduces the synthesized signal by using the transmitting signal and the incident signal's coherent interference. The concept was put forward in radar stealth technology in the 1960s. During the next 50 years, the research of the active cancellation involves the principle, the system and the performance [1,2]. The signal types include linear frequency modulation (LFM) and non-linear frequency modulation (NLFM) [3,4]. The traditional active cancellation uses the transmitting signal to weaken the scattered field. It relies on the targets’ scattering characteristics, which must be obtained and stored in a database to determine the cancellation signal's strength. Some numerical method have been developed to calculate radar cross section (RCS) of arbitrary shape, include finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) [5,6], shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) [7,8] and method of moments (MoM) [9]. However, it is very difficult to acquire precise RCS of complex targets such as the aircraft. Moreover, RCS of aircraft may fluctuate during the flight due to vibration of some moving parts. In this paper, a novel method is presented to weaken the incident field by repeating incident signal, which dexterously avoids establishing a scattering characteristics database. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the method is efficient in canceling chirp-subpulse stepped frequency (CSSF) signal. This method also has a less time delay and smaller error and is more convenient in practice. 2 The principle of active cancellation The CSSF signal has both the characteristics of chirp signal and step frequency signal. It has the high resolution and can reduce the instantaneous bandwidth of the digital signal processor. The active cancellation method proposed in this paper is based on repeater jamming after sampling to interfere with the CSSF signal. The delay time of this method is greatly reduced compared with traditional active cancellation technology. Moreover, if the modulation parameters are chosen properly, the two signals’ phases can be reversed mutually and their amplitudes are the same. Thus, the backscattering signal decreases significantly, which reduces the probability of target detection. The cancellation system is shown in Fig. 1 . The cancellation device consists of five components, which are receiving antenna, signal analysis device, frequency modulation-phase modulation device, power amplifier and transmitting antenna. The incident signal is received by the receiving antenna and distinguished by the signal analysis device. This signal's frequency and phase are modulated by the frequency modulation-phase modulation device to have the same direction, power, frequency and opposite phase with the incident signal. After augmented by the power amplifier, it is transmitted to the scattering target. 3 The coherent interference of the plane wave and the spherical wave 3.1 The scattering of the plane wave and the spherical wave In Fig. 1, the transmitting antenna's cancellation signal is a spherical wave. The incident wave is a plane wave, considering long distance from radar to target compared with wavelength. Thus, it is necessary to verify the effect of the plane wave and the spherical wave. The scattering source is an perfectly electric conductive sphere, whose radius is a. The incident plane wave is (1) E i = E 0 e jkz e ˆ x = E 0 e jkr cos θ e ˆ x where E i is incident electric field, e ˆ x is unit vector along with electric field, k is wave number, x and z are the Cartesian coordinate system's components, r and θ are the spherical coordinate system's components, j is imaginary unit, superscript “i” represents the incident wave, subscript “0” represents the electric field intensity amplitude. The plane wave's scattering far field can be approximated as (2a) E θ s 1 ≈ j E 0 cos ϕ e − jkr kr ∑ n = 1 ∞ b n P n 1 ′ ( cos θ ) − c n P n 1 ( cos θ ) sin θ (2b) E ϕ s 1 ≈ j E 0 sin ϕ e − jkr kr ∑ n = 1 ∞ b n P n 1 ( cos θ ) sin θ − c n P n 1 ′ ( cos θ ) where ϕ is the spherical coordinate's component. P n m ( x ) is associated Legendre polynomial, which is represented as (3) P n m ( x ) = ( − 1 ) m ( 1 − x 2 ) m / 2 d m P n ( x ) d x m where P n (x) is the Legendre function of the nth order. b n and c n are coefficients, which are (4a) b n = − j n ( 2 n + 1 ) J ˆ n ′ ( ka ) n ( n + 1 ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) (4b) c n = − j n ( 2 n + 1 ) J ˆ n ( ka ) n ( n + 1 ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) where a is sphere's radius and (5) J ˆ n ( x ) = x j n ( x ) (6) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( x ) = xh n ( 2 ) ( x ) where j n (x) is spherical Bessel function of the first kind, h n ( 2 ) ( x ) is spherical Hankel function of the second kind. Perfectly conductive sphere's backward RCS is (7) σ 0 = λ 2 4 π ∑ n = 1 ∞ ( − 1 ) n 2 n + 1 H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) 2 The horizontal electric dipole is used to simulate the spherical wave, which is shown in Fig. 2 . The electric dipole can be determined by a current element I d l a . The spherical wave's scattering field can be obtained by method of separate variable. Scattering electric field along with θ and ϕ direction can be expressed as (8a) E θ s 2 ( r ) = η I d l a e − jkr 4 π rd cos ϕ ∑ n = 1 ∞ X 1 P n 1 ′ ( cos θ ) − jX 2 P n 1 ( cos θ ) sin θ (8b) E ϕ s 2 ( r ) = η I d l a e − jkr 4 π rd sin ϕ ∑ n = 1 ∞ X 1 P n 1 ( cos θ ) sin θ − jX 2 P n 1 ′ ( cos θ ) where (9a) X 1 = j n ( 2 n + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) J ˆ n ′ ( kd ) − J ˆ n ′ ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( kd ) (9b) X 2 = j n ( 2 n + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) J ˆ n ( kd ) − J ˆ n ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( kd ) where d is the distance between the dipole and the center of the conducting sphere. In Cartesian coordinate system, the plane wave's and the spherical wave's back scattering field can be approximated as (10a) E s 1 ≈ E 0 e − jkz 2 kz ∑ n = 1 ∞ ( − 1 ) n r 1 e j θ 1 e ˆ x (10b) E s 2 ≈ − η I d l a e − jkz 4 π zd ∑ n = 1 ∞ j n r 2 e j θ 2 e ˆ x where r 1 and r 2 are amplitude of complex number, θ 1 and θ 2 are argument of complex number. r 1 e jθ 1 and r 2 e jθ 2 are represented as (11a) r 1 e j θ 1 = ∑ n = 1 ∞ j ( − 1 ) n 2 n + 1 H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) (11b) r 2 e j θ 2 = ∑ n = 1 ∞ j n 2 n + 1 X 3 + jX 4 where λ is wavelength, η is wave impedance in free space and (12a) X 3 = J ˆ n ′ ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( kd ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) (12b) X 4 = J ˆ n ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( kd ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) According to (10)–(12), the sum of back scattering field of the plane wave and the spherical wave can be expressed as (13) E s ≈ e − jkz e ˆ x 4 π z E 0 λ r 1 e j θ 1 − η I d l a 2 d r 2 e j θ 2 With the spherical wave incident on the sphere, RCS is (14) σ 1 ≈ λ 2 4 π r 1 e j θ 1 + p r 2 e j θ 2 2 where p = − η I d l a 2 λ E 0 d . In (14), σ 1 can be controlled by choosing the value of I d l a and d. 3.2 The effect of the coherent interference 3.2.1 The influence of the distance between source and target The distance between the spherical wave source and conducting sphere have great influence on the corresponding cancellation performance. From (14), when p = − r 1 r 2 cos ( θ 2 − θ 1 ) , σ 1 obtains the minimum value and the horizontal electric dipole is (15) I d l a = − 2 λ d r 1 cos θ 2 − θ 1 η r 2 E 0 When λ and d are assigned proper values, RCS of conductive sphere also gets the minimum value σ min, which is (16) σ min = λ 2 r 1 sin θ 1 − θ 2 4 π Fig. 3 show the variation of optimal cancellation RCS with d when different wavelengths are given. In Fig. 3, we can see that the optimal cancellation RCS is between 0 to πa 2 depending on d. The smaller the wavelength is, the more sensitive of d. In Fig. 3, σ min =0 and σ min = πa 2 when θ 2 − θ 1 = mπ, (m =−1, 0, 1) and θ 1 − θ 2 =0.5mπ, (m =−1, 1), respectively. 3.2.2 The influence of the wavelength on the optimal cancellation effect The variations of the optimal cancellation RCS with λ are shown in Fig. 4 , assuming that distance d between the source and the target is constant. In Fig. 4, we can see as λ varies, the normalized optimal cancellation RCS varies between 0 and 1. When d is constant, the spherical wave cannot always reduce the plane wave's scattering field to 0. 3.2.3 Evaluation of the cancellation's effect The cancellation degree is utilized to evaluate the cancellation's effect, which is defined as (17) S 0 = 20 lg 1 + Δ E E s where S 0 is the cancellation degree, ΔE is the cancellation remainder field, and E s is the target's scattering field. In order to assess the cancellation's effect more precisely, the modified cancellation degree is presented as (18) S = log 2 1 + Δ E E s = log 2 1 + σ σ 0 The cancellation device can make S less than 0.5 or 0.5–1, which mean complete cancellation or partial cancellation, respectively. If S >1, the backscattering is magnified rather than reduced. 3.3 Error analysis 3.3.1 The influence of distance's error The optimal cancellation RCS can be reduced to 0 by setting ideal values of d and I d l a . However, there may be some error to influence the canceling effect. By denoting error of d as Δd, RCS can be expressed as (19) σ 1 ′ ≈ λ 2 4 π r 1 e j θ 1 − η I d l a 2 λ E 0 d + Δ d ∑ n = 1 ∞ j n 2 n + 1 X 5 2 where (20) X 5 = J ˆ n ′ ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( kd + k Δ d ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) + j J ˆ n ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( kd + k Δ d ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) The distance between the spherical wave source and the conductive sphere center is d =2a. The influences of distance's error on the cancellation's effect are shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5, we can see that distance error has a great influence on the cancellation effect. If the distance's error is too large, the result may be a negative effect on the cancellation. When the wavelength is longer, the requirement for the distance's error control is looser. The complete cancellation can be fulfilled in a larger error's range. On the contrary, when the wavelength is shorter, it is necessary to strictly control the distance's error to achieve the complete cancellation performance. 3.3.2 The influence of angle's error If the spherical wave's incident direction is not exactly toward −z, there are angle's errors denoted as Δθ and Δϕ. The back scattering field under Cartesian coordinate can be expressed as (21a) E x s 2 ( r ) = − η I d l a 4 π rd e − jkr cos Δ ϕ ∑ n = 1 ∞ j n ( 2 n + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) X 6 (21b) E y s 2 ( r ) = − η I d l a 4 π rd e − jkr sin Δ ϕ ∑ n = 1 ∞ j n ( 2 n + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) X 7 where (22a) X 6 = J ˆ n ′ ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( kd ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) P n 1 ′ cos Δ θ − j J ˆ n ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( kd ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) P n 1 cos Δ θ sin Δ θ (22b) X 7 = J ˆ n ′ ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( kd ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ′ ( ka ) P n 1 cos Δ θ sin Δ θ − j J ˆ n ( ka ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( kd ) H ˆ n ( 2 ) ( ka ) P n 1 ′ cos Δ θ The conductive sphere's total RCS is (23) σ ≈ λ 2 4 π r 1 e j θ 1 − η I d l a λ d E 0 cos Δ ϕ ∑ n = 1 ∞ j n 2 n + 1 n ( n + 1 ) X 6 2 + λ 2 4 π η I d l a λ d E 0 sin Δ ϕ ∑ n = 1 ∞ j n 2 n + 1 n ( n + 1 ) X 7 2 The distance between the spherical wave source and the conducting sphere center is d =2a. Angle ranges are 0⩽Δθ ⩽90°, −90°⩽Δϕ ⩽90° for θ and ϕ, respectively. The influence of the horizontal electric dipole angle's error on the cancellation degree is shown in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6, we can see that near the point (Δθ =0, Δϕ =0), a slight increase of the angle error may result in a great change to the S. The change of S due to ϕ is smaller than the change due to θ. Generally, under the three different wavelengths, the change trend of S is primarily consistent with the smaller angle error. If angle errors are chosen as (Δθ ⩽15°, −30°⩽Δϕ ⩽30°), we have S <0.5, which means complete cancellation. Whiel if angle errors are chosen as (Δθ ⩽20°, −60°⩽Δϕ ⩽60°), we have S <1, which means partial cancellation. 4 The active cancellation's effect on chirp-subpulse 4.1 Analysis of the CSSF Assuming the CSSF's incident wave is (24) S ( t ) = 1 N τ ∑ i = 0 N − 1 u ( t − iT r ) e j 2 π f i t where N is the number of pulses in each burst, τ is pulse width, T r is pulse repetition time, f i is the ith chirp pulse's carrier frequency, which is (25) f i = f 0 + i Δ f where Δf is step frequency, u(t) is subpulse expressed as (26) u ( t ) = rect t τ e j π kt 2 where rect(x) is the rectangle function, which is (27) rect ( x ) = 1 , − 1 / 2 < t < 1 / 2 0 , others The repeater cancellation wave is (28) S J t = 1 N τ ∑ i = 0 N − 1 rect t − Δ τ − i T r τ e X 8 where the repeater time delay of cancellation device is Δτ(Δτ ≪ τ), the phase modulation is ϕ, the frequency modulation is f d and (29) X 8 = j π μ t − Δ τ − i T r 2 + j 2 π f 0 + f d + i Δ f t − Δ τ + j φ The receiver's matched filter response h(t) is conjugate of S *(−t), which is (30) h t = S * − t = 1 N τ ∑ i = 0 N − 1 rect t + i T r τ e − j π μ t + i T r 2 + j 2 π f 0 + i Δ f t After the target scattering, S(t) enters the receiver's matched filter with S J(t). Then the received signal is (31) S in ( t ) = S ( t ) + S J ( t ) The matched filter's output is (32) S out t = h t * S in t = ∫ − ∞ ∞ h ε S in t − ε d ε = ∫ − ∞ ∞ h ε S t − ε d ε + ∫ − ∞ ∞ h ε S J t − ε d ε = A + B where (33a) A = ∫ − ∞ ∞ h ε S t − ε d ε = 1 N τ ∫ − ∞ ∞ ∑ i = 0 N − 1 rect ε + i T r τ X 9 ∑ i = 0 N − 1 rect t − ε − i T r τ X 10 d ε (33b) B = ∫ − ∞ ∞ h ε S J t − ε d ε = 1 N τ ∫ − ∞ ∞ ∑ i = 0 N − 1 rect ε + i T r τ X 9 ∑ i = 0 N − 1 rect t − ε − Δ τ − i T r τ X 11 d ε where (34a) X 9 = e − j π μ ε + i T r 2 + j 2 π f 0 + i Δ f ε (34b) X 10 = e j π μ t − ε − i T r 2 + j 2 π f 0 + i Δ f t − ε (34c) X 11 = e j π μ t − ε − Δ τ − i T r 2 + j 2 π f 0 + f d + i Δ f t − ε − Δ τ + j φ According to the definition of the rectangular function and piecewise integral to the (33), we have (35a) A = τ − t − k T r N τ e X 12 sinc ( X 13 ) X 14 (35b) B = τ − t − Δ τ − k T r N τ e X 15 sinc ( X 16 ) X 17 where sinc x = sin x x and (36a) X 12 = j π 2 f 0 t + Δ fkt + Δ f k 2 T r (36b) X 13 = π μ − t + k T r − k Δ f τ − t − k T r (36c) X 14 = ∑ i = max − k , 0 min N − 1 − k , N − 1 e j 2 π Δ fi ( t + k T r ) (36d) X 15 = j π 2 f 0 + f d t − Δ τ + Δ fk t − Δ τ + Δ f k 2 T r + j φ (36e) X 16 = π μ − t + Δ τ + k T r − f d − k Δ f τ − t − Δ τ − k T r (36f) X 17 = ∑ i = max − k , 0 min N − 1 − k , N − 1 e j 2 π Δ fi ( t − Δ τ + k T r ) The receiver's matched filter output S out is available when −N +1⩽ k ⩽ N −1. It can be represented in piecewise function, which is (37) S out ( t ) = h t * S t − τ + k T r < t ⩽ − τ + k T r + Δ τ h t * S t + S J fd t − τ + k T r + Δ τ < t ⩽ τ + k T r h t * S J fd t τ + k T r < t ⩽ τ + k T r + Δ τ The convolution terms are (38a) h ( t ) * S ( t ) = τ − t − k T r N τ e X 18 sinc X 19 X 20 (38b) h ( t ) * S J fd ( t ) = τ − t − Δ τ − k T r N τ e X 21 sinc X 22 X 23 where (39a) X 18 = j π 2 f 0 t + Δ fkt + Δ f k 2 T r (39b) X 19 = π μ − t + k T r − k Δ f τ − t − k T r (39c) X 20 = ∑ i = max − k , 0 min N − 1 − k , N − 1 e j 2 π Δ fi t + k T r (39d) X 21 = j π 2 f 0 + f d t − Δ τ + Δ fk t − Δ τ + Δ f k 2 T r + j φ (39e) X 22 = π μ − t + Δ τ + k T r − f d − k Δ f τ − t − Δ τ − k T r (39f) X 23 = ∑ i = max − k , 0 min N − 1 − k , N − 1 e j 2 π Δ fi t − Δ τ + k T r From (37)–(39), we can see that in every pulse recurrence period, the matched filter's output consists of three components. The three components’ domains are (−τ + kT r , − τ + kT r +Δτ), (−τ + kT r +Δτ, τ + kT r ), and (τ + kT r , τ + kT r +Δτ). The corresponding single frequency oscillation outputs are generated by S(t), S(t)+ S J(t), and S J(t), respectively. In the first component, τ −|t − kT r | is close to 0. While in the third component, τ −|t −Δτ − kT r | is close to 0. Thus, the two parts’ peak values can be infinitesimal. The question is how to reduce the peak value of the second component, which is a function of Δτ, f d and ϕ. In order to make the S(t) and S J(t) have better cancellation effect, the repeater time delay should be close to 0. The f d and ϕ should satisfy the following condition (40a) π μ − t + k T r − k Δ f τ − t − k T r = π μ − t + Δ τ + k T r − f d − k Δ f τ − t − Δ τ − k T r (40b) π 2 f 0 t + Δ fkt + Δ f k 2 T r + π = π 2 f 0 + f d t − Δ τ + Δ fk t − Δ τ + Δ f k 2 T r + φ When Δτ is close to 0, the (40) can be written as (41a) μ − t + k T r − k Δ f = μ − t + Δ τ + k T r − f d − k Δ f (41b) π ( 2 f 0 t + Δ fkt + Δ f k 2 T r ) + π = π 2 f 0 + f d t − Δ τ + Δ fk t − Δ τ + Δ f k 2 T r + φ By simplifying (41), we get (42a) f d = μ Δ τ (42b) φ = π 2 f 0 Δ τ − 2 f d t − Δ τ + Δ fk Δ τ + 1 Frequency modulation is the product of μ and Δτ and phase modulation depends on f 0, Δτ, f d, t, Δf and k. 4.2 The simulation of the CSSF's repeater jamming cancellation 4.2.1 The influence of time delay on the cancellation Numerical experiment is conducted to validate the method in this paper. In the numerical experiment, the number of subpulse is N =8, the carrier frequency is 10GHz, which is median of X band whose frequency range is 8–12GHz, the step weight is Δf =1MHz, the pulse recurrence period is T r =100μs, the subpulse's pulse width is τ =10μs, the subpulse's bandwidth is B =5MHz, the subpulse's frequency modulation slope is μ = B/τ =0.5MHz/μs. The cancellation effect under different time delay is shown in Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7, we conclude that the time delay has a significant influence on the cancellation effect. When the time delay is less than 10ns and 50ns, the peak value can be reduced to approximately 20% and 95%, respectively. However, when the time delay increases to 100ns, the peak value exceeds that of no cancellation. Thus, the cancellation device has a very high requirement for the components’ time delay. A short time delay is required to obtain a good cancellation effect. If the time delay is not controlled well, the method may not work or even strengthen the backscattering. 4.2.2 The influence of frequency modulation and phase modulation In (40), Δτ is approximate to infinitesimal. But when τ −|t − kT r | is close to Δτ, the time delay's effect cannot be ignored. It may cause the frequency modulation and phase modulation in (42) ineffective. So the effect of frequency modulation and phase modulation on cancellation should be analyzed. The delay time Δτ is set to 10ns and other simulation parameters are the same as above. The simulation result is shown in Fig. 8 . From Fig. 8, we conclude that appropriate frequency modulation or phase modulation can make the cancellation effect better. The frequency modulation can reduce the side peak value. The phase modulation plays a more important role in the cancellation effect, which makes the peak value reduce to 0.25. 4.2.3 The influence of incident wave's parameters The radar incident wave parameters may have an impact on the cancellation. We studied the influence of bandwidth and step weight on the cancellation effect, which is shown in Figs. 9 and 10 . From Figs. 9 and 10, we conclude that the radar incident wave parameters have a great impact on the cancellation performance. The bandwidth mainly influences the side peak value. The greater the bandwidth, the larger the side peak value. In particular, the step weight mainly influences the main peak value. When the step weight is 0.1MHz and 1MHz, the peak value is lower than 0.025 and higher than 0.2, respectively. However, when the step weight is greater than 10MHz, the peak value exceeds 1. 5 Conclusions This paper proposed a novel active cancellation method to reduce the electromagnetic backscattering of target via interfering incident wave by spherical wave. The active cancellation based on repeater jamming works well on CSSF. The simulation and analysis show that the spherical wave is very efficient in reducing the incident wave in a certain error range. A greater incident wavelength can result in a better cancellation effect. The appropriate frequency modulation and especial phase modulation can make the cancellation wave and original echo get the lower total output amplitude after the matched filter's processing. This method is suitable for the incident signal with a small bandwidth and a small step weight. ", [1] S. Xu Y. Xu Assemble an active cancellation stealth system Microwaves RF 51 7 2012 16 18 [2] S.

Exact solutions are of practical importance for nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs). For instance, exact solutions can provide criteria to check the convergence and precision of numerical algorithms and the references for setting up parameters for experimental investigation [1]. Therefore, a considerable attention has been paid for finding exact solutions of NLEEs and various methods have been proposed e.g., inverse scattering transformation [2], Hirota method [3], modified ( w / g ) -expansion method [4], exp-function method [5], extended auxiliary equation method [6], trial equation method [7], tanh method [8], (G′/G, 1/G)-expansion method [9], improved tan ϕ ( ξ ) 2 -expansion method [10], transformed rational function method [11], exp(−ϕ(ξ)) method [12], ansatz method [13] and so on. In this paper, we skillfully apply the travelling wave transformation that converts the NLEEs into the ordinary differential equations. Then, we derive exact solutions of Tzitzéica type equations. 2 The exponential rational function method We consider the following NLEE of the type [14]: (1) P ( u , u t , u x , u tt , u xt , u xx , … ) = 0 , where u is an unknown function and P is a polynomial of u and its partial derivatives. For solving Eq. (1), we follow the steps below. Step 1. By applying the travelling wave transformation (2) u ( x , t ) = U ( ξ ) , ξ = kx + lt , where k and l are non-zero arbitrary constants, we reduce Eq. (1) to the following ordinary differential equation (3) Q ( U , U ′ , U ′ ′ , U ′ ′ ′ , … ) = 0 . Here, prime denotes derivative with respect to ξ. Eq. (3) should integrated term by term one or more times. Step 2. Assume the solution of Eq. (3) can be expressed as follows: (4) U ( ξ ) = ∑ n = 0 m a n ( 1 + e ξ ) n , where a n (a m ≠0) are constants to be determined later. Determine the integer m by balancing the highest order linear term with the highest order nonlinear term in Eq. (3). Step 3. By substituting Eq. (4) into the left-hand side of Eq. (3) and collecting all terms, we arrive at a polynomial in eξ. We equate each coefficient of this polynomial to zero, for deriving the set of algebraic equations. Finally, we solve the system to construct a variety of exact solutions for Eq. (1). 2.1 The Tzitzéica-Dodd-Bullough equation The Tzitzéica-Dodd-Bullough equation is written as (5) u xt − e − u − e − 2 u = 0 . Under the Painlevé transformation v = e − u or u = − ln v , this equation can be reduced as follows (6) − vv xt + v x v t − v 3 − v 4 = 0 . By introducing a transformation as (2), Eq. (6) can be turned into an ordinary differential equation: (7) kl ( ( V ′ ) 2 − V V ′ ′ ) − V 3 − V 4 = 0 . Balancing V V ′ ′ with V 4 gives m =1. The method of exponential rational function assumes that the solution be written in the following form (8) V ( ξ ) = a 0 + a 1 1 + e ξ , where a 0 and a 1 are constants to be determined. Substituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (7), and setting the coefficients to zero, we obtain a system of algebraic equations (9) − a 0 4 − a 0 3 = 0 , − 4 a 0 3 a 1 − 4 a 0 4 − 3 a 0 2 a 1 − l k a 0 a 1 − 4 a 0 3 = 0 , − 6 a 0 4 − 12 a 0 3 a 1 − 6 a 0 3 − 9 a 0 2 a 1 − 6 a 0 2 a 1 2 − 3 a 0 a 1 2 = 0 , l k a 1 2 − 12 a 0 3 a 1 + l k a 0 a 1 − 4 a 0 3 − 4 a 0 4 − 4 a 0 a 1 3 − a 1 3 − 9 a 0 2 a 1 − 6 a 0 a 1 2 − 12 a 0 2 a 1 2 = 0 , − 3 a 0 2 a 1 − 3 a 0 a 1 2 − 4 a 0 3 a 1 − 6 a 0 2 a 1 2 − 4 a 0 a 1 3 − a 0 3 − a 0 4 − a 1 4 − a 1 3 = 0 Then, we solve this system by using Maple and we find two different cases:Case 1.1: (10) a 0 = 0 , a 1 = − 1 , l = − 1 k , and (11) v 1 ( x , t ) = − 1 1 + cos kx − t k + sinh kx − t k . Therefore, the travelling wave solution of the Tzitzéica-Dodd-Bullough equation is (12) u 1 ( x , t ) = − ln 1 − 1 − cos kx − t k − sinh kx − t k . Case 1.2: (13) a 0 = − 1 , a 1 = 1 , l = − 1 k , and (14) v 2 ( x , t ) = − 1 + 1 1 + cos kx − t k + sinh kx − t k . Therefore, the travelling wave solution of the Tzitzéica-Dodd-Bullough equation is (15) u 2 ( x , t ) = − ln − 1 + 1 1 + cos ( kx − t k ) + sinh ( kx − t k ) . 2.2 The Tzitzéica equation The Tzitzéica equation is given as (16) u tt − u xx − e u + e − 2 u = 0 . Under the Painlevé transformation v = e u or u = ln v , this equation can be reduced as follows (17) vv tt − vv xx − v t 2 + v x 2 − v 3 + 1 = 0 . By using a transformation as Eq. (2), Eq. (17) is converted to the following ordinary differential equation (18) ( l 2 − k 2 ) ( V V ″ − ( V ′ ) 2 ) − V 3 + 1 = 0. Balancing VV″ with V 3 gives m =2. We seek the exact solution of Eq. (18) as: (19) V ( ξ ) = a 0 + a 1 1 + e ξ + a 2 ( 1 + e ξ ) 2 . Substituting Eq. (19) into Eq. (18) and equating the coefficients to zero, we find: (20) − a 0 3 + 1 = 0 , − 3 a 0 2 a 1 + 6 + l 2 a 0 a 1 − k 2 a 0 a 1 − 6 a 0 3 a 1 = 0 , − 3 a 0 a 1 l 2 + 15 + 2 l 2 a 0 a 1 − 15 a 0 2 a 1 − 15 a 0 3 − 4 k 2 a 0 a 2 − 3 a 0 2 a 2 + 4 l 2 a 0 a 2 − 2 k 2 a 0 a 1 = 0 , l 2 a 1 a 2 − 12 a 0 a 1 2 + l 2 a 1 2 + 20 − a 1 3 − 12 a 0 2 a 2 − 6 a 0 a 1 a 2 − 30 a 0 2 a 1 − 20 a 0 3 − 6 k 2 a 0 a 2 − k 2 a 1 a 2 + 6 l 2 a 0 a 2 + k 2 a 1 2 = 0 , − 18 a 0 a 1 a 2 + 2 k 2 a 1 a 2 − 3 a 1 2 a 2 − 3 a 1 3 + 2 k 2 a 0 a 1 − 18 a 0 a 1 2 + 2 k 2 a 1 2 − 18 a 0 2 a 2 − 30 a 0 2 a 1 + 15 − 2 l 2 a 1 a 2 − 3 a 0 a 2 2 − 2 l 2 a 0 a 1 − 2 l 2 a 1 2 − 15 a 0 3 = 0 , 2 k 2 a 2 2 − 3 a 1 a 2 2 − 12 a 0 2 a 2 − 18 a 0 a 1 a 2 + 2 k 2 a 0 a 2 − 6 a 0 a 2 2 + k 2 a 0 a 1 + k 2 a 1 2 − l 2 a 1 2 − 2 l 2 a 2 2 − 15 a 0 2 a 1 − 3 l 2 a 1 a 2 − 6 a 1 2 a 2 − l 2 a 0 a 1 − 2 l 2 a 0 a 2 + 3 k 2 a 1 a 2 − 3 a 1 3 + 6 − 6 a 0 3 − 12 a 0 a 1 2 = 0 , 1 − 3 a 1 a 2 2 − 3 a 0 2 a 1 − 3 a 0 2 a 2 − 3 a 0 a 1 2 − 3 a 0 a 2 2 − 3 a 1 2 a 2 − a 1 3 − a 0 3 − 6 a 0 a 1 a 2 − a 2 3 = 0. From the solution of the system above, we obtain different cases: (21) a 0 = 1 , a 1 = − 6 , a 2 = 6 and l = ± 3 + k 2 Case 2.1–2.2:We substitute Eq. (21) into Eq. (19) to find: (22) v 1 , 2 ( x , t ) = 1 − 6 1 + cosh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) + sinh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) (23) + 6 ( 1 + cosh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) + sinh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) ) 2 . Therefore, the travelling wave solutions of the Tzitzéica equation are obtained as (24) u 1 , 2 ( x , t ) = ln ( 1 − 6 1 + cosh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) + sinh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) + 6 ( 1 + cosh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) + sinh ( kx ± 3 + k 2 t ) ) 2 ) . 2.3 The Dodd-Bullough-Mikhailov equation Finally, we consider the Dodd-Bullough-Mikhailov equation (25) u xt + e u + e − 2 u = 0 . Under the Painlevé transformation v = e u or u = ln v , this equation can be reduced as follows (26) vv xt − v x v t + + v 3 + 1 = 0 . Now we use a transformation as Eq. (2) to convert Eq. (26) to the following ordinary differential equation: (27) kl ( V V ″ − ( V ′ ) 2 ) + V 3 + 1 = 0. Balancing VV″ with V 3 gives m =2. So, the homogeneous balance method admits the use of a finite expansion in the form Eq. (19). We substitute Eq. (19) into Eq. (27) and after that set the coefficients equal to zero. This results in: (28) a 0 3 + 1 = 0 , 6 a 0 3 + k l a 0 a 1 + 3 a 0 2 a 1 + 6 = 0 , 2 k l a 0 a 1 + 3 a 0 2 a 2 + 15 a 0 2 a 1 + 3 a 0 a 1 2 + 4 k l a 0 a 2 + 15 + 15 a 0 3 = 0 , k l a 1 a 2 + 20 a 0 3 + 12 a 0 2 a 2 − k l a 1 2 + 12 a 0 a 1 2 + 20 + 30 a 0 2 a 1 + 6 k l a 0 a 2 + 6 a 0 a 1 a 2 + a 1 3 = 0 , − 2 k l a 1 a 2 + 15 a 0 3 + 3 a 1 2 a 2 − 2 k l a 1 2 + 18 a 0 2 a 2 + 18 a 0 a 1 a 2 + 18 a 0 a 1 2 + 30 a 0 2 a 1 + 3 a 0 a 2 2 − 2 k l a 0 a 1 + 15 + 3 a 1 3 = 0 , 18 a 0 a 1 a 2 − k l a 0 a 1 − 2 k l a 0 a 2 + 3 a 1 3 − 3 k l a 1 a 2 + 15 a 0 2 a 1 − k l a 1 2 − 2 k l a 2 2 + 3 a 1 a 2 2 + 12 a 0 a 1 2 + 6 a 0 3 + 6 a 1 2 a 2 + 6 + 12 a 0 2 a 2 + 6 a 0 a 2 2 = 0 , 1 + 3 a 0 2 a 1 + 3 a 0 2 a 2 + 3 a 0 a 1 2 + 3 a 0 a 2 2 + a 1 3 + 3 a 1 2 a 2 + 3 a 1 a 2 2 + a 2 3 + 6 a 0 a 1 a 2 + a 0 3 = 0. Then, we solve this system with Maple and find (29) a 0 = − 1 , a 1 = 6 , a 2 = − 6 , l = 3 k , and (30) v ( x , t ) = − 1 + 6 1 + cosh ( kx + 3 t k ) + sinh ( kx + 3 t k ) (31) − 6 ( 1 + cosh ( kx + 3 t k ) + sinh ( kx + 3 t k ) ) 2 . Therefore, the travelling wave solution of the Dodd-Bullough-Mikhailov equation is obtained as (32) u ( x , t ) = ln ( − 1 + 6 1 + cosh ( kx + 3 t k ) + sinh ( kx + 3 t k ) − 6 ( 1 + cosh ( kx + 3 t k ) + sinh ( kx + 3 t k ) ) 2 ) . 3 Conclusions With the help of symbolic computation (Maple), we have solved the Tzitzéica-Dodd-Bullough equation, the Tzitzéica equation and the Dodd-Bullough-Mikhailov equation by using the exponential rational function method. Several exact solutions have been derived which are in agreement with the results reported in [15]. It is worthwhile to mention that the exponential rational function method is an effective technique for solving other nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics. "," [1] Q.M. Huang Y.T.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.095,A novel optimized double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell with improved performance: A numerical simulation,"Abstract In this paper, the performance of a double junction solar cell with a novel structure, i.e., made up of two layers of copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) & copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) and two layers of anti-reflector coatings namely zinc telluride (ZnTe) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) on the top layer of the cell are studied and optimized. To obtain an optimized performance, the effect of CIGS band gap changes on the efficiency is studied. For establishing the current matching in two sub-cells, the effect of thickness of ZnTe and CdS anti-reflectors layers is investigated for optimum short circuit current. The optimized proposed double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell has an efficiency and fill factor of 45.37% and 86.37%, respectively.",Feb-18," Keywords Double junction Anti-reflector Current matching Efficiency Fill factor 1 Introduction Today, the increase of global energy consumption and the environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel consumptions are the greatest problems that endanger the survival of the environment. To decrease the consumption of non-renewable natural resources and malicious fuels for environment, many scientific attempts has been made to reduce the costs of the renewable energy resources production. With the increasing development of technology, the production of electrical energy have been done, using solar spectrum energy; and this energy conversion has been made through the use of the essential property of semiconductors. Among the renewable energy resources, the solar spectrum energy has got a particular importance: because it is easily available, unlimited, and does not pollute the environment. The thin-film solar cells are appropriate and authentic options for production of electrical power and photovoltaic (PV) applications [1–4]. In [1], a double junction (DJ) InGaN/CIGS solar cell with a CdS anti-reflector coating (ARC) was simulated, and the obtained efficiency and fill factor were 40.42 % and 78.6 % respectively. While CIGS has been made of scarce elements, CZTS is made of abundant elements on earth; thus CZTS can be an appropriate replacement for CIGS. In [2], a method of simple solid-phase synthesis was utilized to prepare pure CZTS nano-crystalline. CZTS absorber films were fabricated by developing a novel route based on integration of non-vacuum and vacuum technique. In [3], DJ InGaP/GaAs solar cell with InAlGaP back surface field (BSF) layers was modeled numerically. However, a maximum conversion efficiency of 32.19 % was achieved, which is a low efficiency. Review of previous researches about CIGS solar cells development indicates the maximum value of 20 % for efficiency [4] which is not yet satisfactory. ARC less DJ InGaP/GaAs solar cell that a InGaP/InGaP tunnel junction has been used in its structure, and its top BSF dual layer has been optimized, has a better absorption of solar spectrum due to invention of a new tunnel junction and optimization of the top BSF layer; and therefore improves parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc) ،open-circuit voltage (Voc) and efficiency [5]. However, the efficiency value of 40.87 % is achieved for 1000 suns illuminated under standard AM1.5G spectrum. The simulated structure of the InGaP/GaAs based DJ solar cell, by using a layer of 0.11μm thick carbon nanotubes, shows that adding a layer of carbon nanotubes on the surface of the cell, although leading to an increased efficiency of 41.95 %, but leads to a decreased fill factor of 72.2% [6]. CZTS as one of the most applicable semiconducting compounds, which functions as an absorber layer in the solar cells are in demand. The applicability of CZTS is as the result of the high absorption constant of 104–105 cm−1 in the visible light wavelengths range, direct band gap energy in the range of 1.4–1.5 ev, and also being formed by abundant and non-toxic elements [7]. A solution, with the focus on the results of sulfurization technique study, has been proposed to improve the conversion efficiency of the thin-film solar cell based on CZTS that has increased the conversion efficiency to 6.7 %. However, many problems remained that include detailed physical features of CZTS for improving the conversion efficiency [8]. In this paper, a new structure of DJ CZTS/CIGS solar cell with two ZnTe and CdS anti-reflectors is designed, and the characteristics and parameters of this structure such as fill factor and efficiency have been optimized to achieve the most efficient structure. The key parameter of solar cell such as efficiency and fill factor has been increased in the proposed structure. 2 The structure and simulation of double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell Solar cells are the solid state components that work based on the photovoltaic effect. The phenomenon of the conversion of solar light spectrum energy into electrical energy is called photovoltaic effect. Many semiconductors can convert the solar energy into electrical energy. Various procedures and materials are employed to use the photovoltaic effect, but in practice, almost every photovoltaic energy conversions use semiconductors in the form of p-n junction. The spectral light radiation on the solar cells provides the current and voltage needed for electric power production. Sunlight contains the complex spectrum with different wavelengths each of which has the specific energy of its own. Ideal spectral response of solar cell is limited in long wavelengths because of semiconductor’s disability to absorb photons with energy lower than band gap energy. Similarly, short wavelengths with higher energy than band gap energy are not utilized by solar cells but pass through them. These wavelengths transform to heat and increase solar cells’ temperature. Mentioned disability in full use of different energies of the solar light spectrum shows a significant loss of power in single p-n junction solar cells [9–12]. The use of different material with different band gaps energy in the structure of multi-junction solar cells result in the absorption of different wavelengths. Therefore, in multi-junction solar cells light absorption is more, and thus the efficiency is higher, and this has brought multi-junction solar cells a special attention. In this regard, the double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell with two ZnTe and CdS anti-reflector layers is simulated with ATLAS simulator of Silvaco software. AM1.5 spectrum is used to radiate to the double junction solar cell model. The amount of total reflections of the multi-junction solar cell of the whole energy of AM1.5 solar spectrum is called total reflection as shown in Fig. 1 for the proposed double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell with two ZnTe and CdS anti-reflector layers. The proposed structure of the double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell is illustrated in Fig. 2 . It contains following layers from top to bottom: a ZnTe layer with 0.2509μm thickness as an anti-reflector layer, a CdS layer with 0.1491μm thickness as another anti-reflector layer, a p-CZTS layer with 0.15μm thickness as an absorber layer (p=1×1020 cm−3), a n-CZTS layer with 0.5μm thickness as a buffer layer (n=6×1021 cm−3), a vacuum layer with 0.15μm thickness as a tunnel junction, a p-CIGS layer with 0.1μm thickness as an absorber layer (p=2×1020 cm−3), a n-CIGS layer with 4.69μm thickness as a buffer layer (n=1×1014 cm−3). Photovoltaic parameters of the components of the proposed solar cell structure are presented in Table 1 . The mesh structure of the double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell with two ZnTe and CdS anti-reflector layers simulated with ATLAS simulator of silvaco software is shown in Fig. 3 . Optimizing the efficiency of the double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell with two CdS and ZnTe anti-reflector layers is carried out in several steps. First; the advantage of applying CIGS in the structure of solar cells is due to the variation of the band gap energy from 1.07ev to 1.69ev, which gives the opportunity to consider adequate band gap energy for each specific application. As shown in Fig. 4 , changing CIGS band gap energy from 1.07 ev to 1.69 ev, efficiency of the solar cell changes, and the most amount of efficiency, which is 45.37 %, is achieved in 1.69 ev band gap energy. At second step of the efficiency optimization, we follow current matching of the sub-cells in the proposed structure. By establishing current matching, the short-circuit current of the top and bottom cells will become equal, and the maximum efficiency occurs. The curves related to the changes of the top and bottom cells short circuit currents based on the changes of CdS and ZnTe thicknesses are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the curves of the top and bottom cells short-circuit currents cross each other respectively at the point in which CdS thickness is 0.149μm and ZnTe thickness is 0.251μm that corresponds to the short-circuit current of 3.074×10−8 A, and therefore, the current matching is established. 3 Discussions and results In this part, we express a series of applicable parameters such as maximum power, fill factor and efficiency of solar cell, and the results obtained from the simulation of the proposed DJ solar cell. When a semiconductor is exposed to a source of light, its conductivity enhances by production of electron-hole pairs. This event is called photoconductive effect. One of the main parameters in solar cells is photo-generation rate. Photo-generation rate of the proposed solar cell is illustrated in Fig. 7 . Also, doping of semiconductors enhances its conductivity. The amount of net doping in every one of the constituent layers of the solar cell is presented in Fig. 8 . Density of acceptor impurity ions is obtained as follows: (1) N A − = N A 1 + g e ε A − E F K B T where, N A (cm−3) is acceptor concentration, ε A is acceptor level energy, g is ground state degeneracy equal to 4, E F is Fermi level energy, T is Kelvin temperature, and KB is Boltzmann constant equal to 1.38×10−23 J/K. Also, density of donor impurity ions is obtained as follows: (2) N D + = n 0 + N A − − p 0 Where, p 0 and n 0 are density of holes and electrons in intrinsic semiconductors, respectively. Created electron-hole pairs in a semiconductor cause electric potential energy which in turn cause an electric field in each layer. The potential and electric field of each layer of the proposed DJ CZTS/CIGS solar cell is illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. If an electron loss its energy, it returns to the valence band. Combining with one hole in the valence band leads to recombination process to take place. Each recombination process leads to reduction of one hole. Recombination process in each material depends on its lifespan. Therefore, recombination rate is different in materials with various lifespan. Fig. 11 illustrates the recombination rate of different layers of the proposed solar cell. Each solar cell has a specific current-voltage curve which starts at zero voltage, where the current is Isc (the short-circuit current of the cell), and ends at Voc voltage (the open-circuit voltage of the cell), where the current is zero. As shown in Fig. 12 , the short-circuit current of the top, bottom and total cells are equal, and it shows the current matching in the two sub-cells and the high quality of the solar cell. One of the main parameters of solar cell is maximum power of solar cell(P max ) which is achieved V max somewhere between V=0 and V=V oc called ThevoltageVmax is an optimum point, and corresponding current of Vmax is called Imax. ThePmax is obtained as follows: (3) P m a x = V m a x × I m a x Another parameter of a solar cell is the fill factor (FF) that determines the quality factor of a solar cell. It is considered as a significant factor in comparing the efficiency of solar cells. The fill factor is obtained as follows: (4) F F = I m a x × V m a x I s c × V o c However, efficiency is the most important parameter of a solar cell and is obtained as follows: (5) η % = V o c × I s c × F F × 100 P i n Where, P in is the power of AM1.5 solar spectrum which is1000w . m −2. Following relation is used to change its unit to watt: (6) P i n = A × 1000 Where A is the area of the surface of solar cell. The comparison of performance of the proposed solar cell structure with others solar cells is summarized in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2, the proposed DJ CZTS/CIGS solar cell has the highest fill factor (86.37 %) and the highest conversion efficiency (45.37 %) among the previous suggested solar cells, which shows the proposed solar cell has better energy conversion efficiency. Also, the proposed DJ CZTS/CIGS solar cell has the highest amount of Isc and Voc among the referred solar cells. 4 Conclusion A novel double junction CZTS/CIGS solar cell with two ZnTe and CdS anti-reflector layers, is simulated using ATLAS simulator silvaco software. The effect of CIGS band gap changes on the efficiency, resulted in obtaining a maximum efficiency of 45.37% at Eg =1.69ev. The effect of changing the thickness of ZnTe and CdS anti-reflectors layers for obtaining current matching resulted in an optimum CdS thickness of 0.149μm and the ZnTe thickness of 0.251μm, where the short-circuit current was equal in both top and bottom cell; and the current matching occurred with obtained short-circuit current of Isc =3.074×10−8 A. The proposed solar cell’s fill factor is excellent with the amount of 86.37 %. Finally, the proposed solar cell with such characteristics has better energy conversions performance compared with other works reported so far.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.019,Deriving the geocentric vector and the solar vector from the atmospheric polarization pattern on LEO satellites,"Abstract Using the polarimetric imaging sensor on LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) satellites to photograph the atmospheric polarization pattern derived from the polarized light backscattered by the atmospheric particles is proposed in this paper. First, the formation of polarization pattern and its measurement principle are introduced based on Rayleigh scattering, and the extraatmospheric polarization pattern is analyzed. Afterwards, it is presented that how to attain the geocentric vector and the solar vector simultaneously from the polarization pattern through the least squares method, which is verified by simulation subsequently. The simulation results show that it is feasible to derive the two vectors from the captured image.",Feb-18," Keywords Solar vector Geocentric vector Polarimetric sensor Polarization pattern Rayleigh scattering Least squares 1 Introduction The atmospheric polarization pattern formed after the sunlight is scattered by atmospheric molecules and aerosols, is exploited by many wild animals and insects to derive compass information. Bees can sense the polarization pattern through their compound eyes. After finding the honey source, they need an azimuth reference determined by E-vector of the polarization pattern to give its direction by means of dancing [1–5]. Many migratory songbirds, such as Savannah sparrows, also have the capability to use polarized light cues, especially the region of sky near the horizon, to recalibrate the compass in the course of migration every year [6]. Monarch butterflies in North America sense the polarization pattern of ultraviolet band and regard E-vector as the reference direction to aid navigation when they migrate to Mexico [7,8]. Desert ants could utilize the polarization pattern as a compass to return to their nest on the shortest path possible after performing a large-scale foraging excursion [9–11]. Certainly, other animals such as spider and shrimp, can also use the polarization pattern for orientation [12,13]. Imitating polarization navigation of insects, kinds of bio-polarization sensors are designed to measure the polarization pattern, and various methods are proposed to obtain compass information from the polarization pattern. Kane Usher puts forward that the scanning method with a digital camera is used to measure polarization pattern. Meanwhile, the image information attained is analyzed preliminarily to obtain the degree of polarization and polarization angle [14]. CMOS image sensor is designed, which outputs light intensity information of different polarized directions to achieve the degree of polarization and polarization angle [15–19]. Daobin Wang designs a real-time bionic camera-based polarization navigation sensor to measure polarization pattern through three images of different polarized directions (0°, 45° and 90°), the accuracy of which can obtain 0.3° [20]. Jinkui Chu has implemented a metal grid polarization sensor, whose accuracy is superior to 0.1° [21–23]. Zhiwen Xian designs a bio-inspired polarization navigation sensor and gives a new method of calculating polarization angle [24,25]. Based on these sensors, different calibration methods of polarization sensors are proposed including the variable substation and curve fitting, the multi-objective optimization and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, and the least squares [26–28]. In addition, some researchers are also trying to apply the new information derived from the polarization pattern to positioning and attitude determination [29–31]. Although more and more people are studying bio-polarization navigation, they primarily focus attention on polarimetric studies in the atmosphere while the extraatmospheric polarimetric characteristics research is still situated in the exploratory phase. In contrast to the endo-atmosphere polarization pattern formed due to the polarized light forescattered by the atmospheric particles and aerosols, the polarization pattern outside the atmosphere is derived from the polarized light backscattered by these particles. The backscatter polarization pattern photographed outside the atmosphere contains the azimuth information of the earth and the sun. Thus, it is put forward in this paper that the geocentric vector and the sun vector could be extracted from polarization pattern, which can provide relevant measurement information for the LEO satellite’s orbit determination and attitude determination. Jun Zhou has studied the extraatmospheric polarimetric characteristics initially, and presented the idea of applying the new navigation information derived from the polarization pattern to satellite navigation [32,33]. To demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining the geocentric vector and solar vector based on the polarization pattern, this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief overview of the polarization pattern and principles of the polarimetric imaging sensor. In Section 3, the least square method of obtaining the geocentric vector and the solar vector is put forward. In Section 4, the simulation is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining the geocentric vector and the solar vector simultaneously by means of least squares and the results are analyzed. Some conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2 Polarization pattern description and its measurement 2.1 Measurement of polarization pattern Rayleigh scattering occurs when the atmospheric molecule is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, which results in the polarization pattern. Fig. 1 shows the 3D polarization pattern formed based on the single scattering Rayleigh model. O is the observation position. O S ⇀ , O Z ⇀ and O P ⇀ represent the solar direction, the zenithal direction and the observing direction respectively. The width of the dashed line indicates the degree of polarization (DOP) while its tangent direction indicates the E-vector orientation observed from the center of hemisphere. Then, the DOP of O P ⇀ is (1) D O P ( γ ) = 1 − cos 2 γ 1 + cos 2 γ × D O P max where γ is the angle between the solar direction and the observing direction. DOP max is the maximum value of DOP, which is smaller than 1.0 generally due to the interference of many kinds of factors like the weather. The polarization characteristic of light is generally expressed by the Stokes vector S = ( I , Q , U , V ) , in which I represents the total light intensity, Q represents the linearly polarized light intensity of 0° direction, U represents the linearly polarized light intensity of 45° direction, and V represents the circularly polarized light intensity. V is negligible, generally speaking. Then, the DOP can be calculated according to I, Q and U. (2) D O P = Q 2 + U 2 I The residual three Stokes parameters can be measured by the polarimetric imaging sensor, the schematic representation of which is shown in Fig. 2 . O ′ f X s Y s Z s is the pixel reference frame. The center O ′ f of the imaging focal plane is taken as the origin, O ′ f X s and O ′ f Y s are established in the focal plane parallel with the row and column of the pixels of the CCD sensor respectively, and O ′ f Z s is the optical axis. F is the center of the convex lens. The three linear polarizers are installed at 0°, 60° and 120° with the respect to the reference direction of the sensor. Then, the sensor can attain three pictures by means of collecting the light intensity from three different polarizing directions. Consequently, according to the three images collected, the computer will calculate the three Stokes parameters (I, Q and U) of each pixel P i , j ( x i , y j ) . Finally, we could obtain the DOP of each corresponding observing directions through Eq. (2). Assume that the angle between the linear polarizer and the reference direction of the sensor is α. Then, the polarized light intensity of α direction is the function of I, Q and U, which can be expressed as follows: (3) I ′ ( α ) = 1 2 ( I + Q cos 2 α + U sin 2 α ) where I ′ ( α ) is the measured polarized light intensity of the α direction. Then, the three unknown variables I, Q and U in Eq. (3) can be solved according to the measured light intensity of the chosen three directions (namely α=0°, 60° and 120°). (4) I = 2 3 ( I ′ ( 0 ° ) + I ′ ( 60 ° ) + I ′ ( 120 ° ) ) Q = 2 3 ( 2 I ′ ( 0 ° ) − I ′ ( 60 ° ) − I ′ ( 120 ° ) ) U = 2 3 ( I ′ ( 0 ° ) − I ′ ( 120 ° ) ) According to Eqs. (2) and (4), we can calculate the DOP of each pixel of the image. 2.2 Extraatmospheric polarization pattern According to Rayleigh scattering, it can be known that the distribution of the forescattered light is symmetrical to that of the backscattered light when the incident light is natural light. As shown in Fig. 3 , the angle between the forescattered light and the incident light is less than 90° while the angle between the backscattered light and the incident light is greater than 90°. Therefore, the polarization pattern in the atmosphere is formed mainly due to the forescattered polarized light while the polarization pattern out of atmosphere is derived from the backscattered polarized light primarily. As shown in Fig. 4 , the green thin dashed circle indicates the atmospheric boundary, and it is divided into four regions by the red thick dashed line, namely I, II, III and IV. II and III indicate the atmosphere illuminated by the sun, called the atmospheric illumination region while I and IV represent the atmospheric shadow region; II and I represents the atmospheric region visible from the satellite while III and IV indicates the invisible atmospheric region. Then, it can be attained that II is the observable area of the polarization pattern from the satellite. The observable region of the polarimetric imaging sensor on the satellite can be described mathematically as follows: Assume that the geocentric vector is r , and the solar unit vector is s . r e is the position vector of any point on the boundary of the atmosphere. Then, two conditions must be satisfied to make r e point to the observable region II. (5) { arccos ( − ( r e − r ) ⋅ r ∥ r e − r ∥ r ) ≤ arcsin ( r e r ) arccos ( r e ⋅ s r e ) ≤ π 2 All the points meeting the two conditions above compose the observable region of the extraatmospheric polarization pattern. The polarimetric imaging sensor can be used on LEO satellites to photograph the observable region of the atmosphere. Suppose that the optical axis O ′ f Z s points to the center of the earth and the solar vector is in the plane O ′ f X s Z s . α is the angle between the solar vector and the optical vector. Suppose that the orbit altitude of the satellite is 400km. Then, the DOP image of the observable atmospheric pattern changing with α is shown in Fig. 5 . The value of DOP is expressed in different colors. 3 Obtaining the geocentric vector and solar vector Through the polarimetric imaging sensor on the Low-Earth Orbit satellite, we can not only get the earth contour image, but also get the DOP image. In this section, we present the method of using least squares to deal with the earth contour image and the DOP image of the observable atmospheric pattern to derive the geocentric vector and the solar vector simultaneously. 3.1 Calculating the geocentric vector As shown in Fig. 6 , O ′ f X s Y s Z s is the pixel reference frame; the blue sphere indicates the earth and the point O e represents the center of the earth; The green dotted circle indicates the atmospheric boundary; F is the lens center, and O ′ f F ⇀ represents the focal vector, denoted by f ; O ′ e indicates the position of the geocenter on the imaging focal plane, and O ′ e O e ⇀ is the geocentric vector, denoted by r . Assuming that the angle between r and f is θ. The green ellipse represents the earth contour image in the focal plane. In Fig. 6, P k is a pixel of the earth edge, the coordinates of which are ( x k , y k ) ( k = 1,2 , ⋯ , n ) . β is the angle between F P k ⇀ and F O ′ e ⇀ . The modulus of O ′ f F ⇀ is the focal length, denoted by f. Obviously, P k ( x k , y k ) is always in the cone surface, the central axis of which is F O ′ e ⇀ with the half cone angle β. The coordinates of F and P k are noted as ( 0,0 , f ) and ( x k , y k , 0 ) respectively. Assume that the coordinates of O ′ e are ( x , y , 0 ) , then F P k ⇀ = ( x k , y k , − f ) F O ′ e ⇀ = ( x , y , − f ) Select n pixels from the earth contour image at equal intervals, then we can get that (6) x 1 x + y 1 y + f 2 x 1 2 + y 1 2 + f 2 = x 2 x + y 2 y + f 2 x 2 2 + y 2 2 + f 2 = ⋯ = x n x + y n y + f 2 x n 2 + y n 2 + f 2 = c 1 Where c 1 is a constant. Eq. (6) can be simplified to the following matrix equation, (7) [ x 1 y 1 − x 1 2 + y 1 2 + f 2 x 2 y 2 − x 2 2 + y 2 2 + f 2 ⋯ x n y n − x n 2 + y n 2 + f 2 ] [ x y c 1 ] = [ − f 2 − f 2 ⋯ − f 2 ] ⇒ A x = b The least square solution of which is, x = ( A T A ) − 1 A T b Therefore, it can be attained that the coordinates of the geocentric unit vector in O ′ f X s Y s Z s are ( x , y , f ) x 2 + y 2 + f 2 . 3.2 Calculating the solar vector In this section, we propose the method of using least squares to deal with the DOP image to obtain the solar unit vector. As shown in Fig. 7 , O ′ f X s Y s Z s is the pixel reference frame. γ i and γ j represent the angles between the solar vector and the observing directions. P i ( x i , y i ) and P j ( x j , y j ) denote the coordinates of any two pixels of the DOP image. P i O f ⇀ and P j O f ⇀ represent the corresponding observing directions, the DOPs of which are D O P ( P i ) and D O P ( P j ) respectively. According to Eq. (1), if D O P ( P i ) = D O P ( P j ) , we can obtain that (8) γ i = γ j Choose n pixels from the DOP image, the coordinates of which are P i ( x i , y i ) ( i = 1,2 , ⋯ , n ) . Their DOPs are D O P ( P i ) , all of which satisfy ( d 0 − ε ) < D O P ( P i ) < ( d 0 + ε ) . ε is a small quantity. d 0 is a constant chosen, and satisfies 0< d 0 <1. According to Eq. (1), it can be obtained that, (9) γ 1 = γ 2 =⋯= γ n As P i F ⇀ = ( − x i , − y i , f ) and S ′ F ⇀ = ( − x , − y , f ) , then (10) x 1 x + y 1 y + f 2 x 1 2 + y 1 2 + f 2 = x 2 x + y 2 y + f 2 x 2 2 + y 2 2 + f 2 = ⋯ = x n x + y n y + f 2 x n 2 + y n 2 + f 2 = c 2 Where c 2 is a constant. Eq. (10) can be simplified to the following matrix equation, (11) [ x 1 y 1 − x 1 2 + y 1 2 + f 2 x 2 y 2 − x 2 2 + y 2 2 + f 2 ⋯ x n y n − x n 2 + y n 2 + f 2 ] [ x y c 2 ] = [ − f 2 − f 2 ⋯ − f 2 ] ⇒ A x = b The least square solution of which is, (12) x = ( A T A ) − 1 A T b Therefore, the coordinates of solar unit vector in O ′ f X s Y s Z s are s = ( − x , − y , f ) x 2 + y 2 + f 2 . This method can also be applied to calculating the solar vector for the polarization pattern in the atmosphere. 4 Simulation and analysis Assume that the earth is photographed with a polarimetric imaging sensor at an orbital altitude of 400km. Let f =1. Then, two cases are simulated as the following. Case 1: As shown in Fig. 8 , suppose that the optical axis points to the geocenter and the angle between the solar vector and the geocentric vector is 180°. In this case, the coordinates of the geocentric unit vector in O ′ f X s Y s Z s are R = ( 0 0 1 ) T , while the coordinates of the solar unit vector are s = ( 0 0 − 1 ) T . The white Gaussian noise ( u = 0 , σ = 0.005 ) is added to the earth contour image and the DOP image. Let d 0 =0.5, ε =0.005. According to Eqs. (7) and (12), we can get the estimated coordinates of the geocentric vector in O ′ f X s Y s Z s are R ˆ = ( 0.000047 − 0.000011 1 ) T , and the estimated coordinates of the solar vector are s ˆ = ( 0.00038 0.00014 − 1 ) T . According to the simulation results, we can get the error angle δ e of the geocentric vector and the error angle δ s of the solar vector are (13) { δ e = arccos ( R ⋅ R ˆ | R | ⋅ | R ˆ | ) = 0.003 ∘ δ s = arccos ( s ⋅ s ˆ | s | ⋅ | s ˆ | ) = 0.023 ∘ Case 2: As shown in Fig. 9 , suppose that the coordinates of the geocentric vector and the solar vector in O ′ f X s Y s Z s are R = ( 0.06186 0.06186 1 ) T and s = ( − 1.7321 0 − 1 ) T respectively. The white Gaussian noise ( u = 0 , σ = 0.005 ) is added to the earth contour image and the DOP image. Let d 0 =0.5, ε =0.005. According to Eqs. (7) and (12), we can get the estimated coordinates of the geocentric vector in O ′ f X s Y s Z s are R ˆ = ( 0.06179 0.06183 1 ) T , and the estimated coordinates of the solar vector are s ˆ = ( − 1.7298 − 0.0003 − 1 ) T . According to the simulation results, we can get the error angle δ e of the geocentric vector and the error angle δ s of the solar vector are (14) { δ e = arccos ( R ⋅ R ˆ | R | ⋅ | R ˆ | ) = 0.004 ° δ s = arccos ( s ⋅ s ˆ | s | ⋅ | s ˆ | ) = 0.034 ° According to the simulation results and analysis, it can be concluded that the least square method of attaining the solar vector and the geocentric vector is feasible. 5 Conclusions The polarimetric imaging sensor is proposed to be applied to the Low-Earth Orbit satellite to photograph the atmospheric polarization pattern. Then, the least squares method is presented to derive the geocentric vector from the earth contour image and the solar vector from the DOP image, which is verified by simulation. The simulation results show that it is feasible to derive the geocentric vector and the solar vector simultaneously from the polarized image by least squares method. In the future work, we will study how to use the new navigation information on LEO satellites.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.032,Temperature sensor and fiber laser based on optical microfiber knot resonator,"Abstract An easy method to fabricate microfiber-knot resonator (MKR) is designed and its application as a temperature sensor and multi-wavelength fiber laser (MWFL) is demonstrated. The MKR has a temperature sensitivity of 14.5pm/°C over a temperature range of 27–95°C, and experimental results show good linearity between the temperature and resonant wavelength shifts. As an MWFL on the other hand, up to four lasing lines with a channel spacing of 4.29nm are obtained. These results confirm that the MKR could be employed as a high performance comb filter to realize compact optical sensor and MWFL designs.",Feb-18," Keywords Temperature sensor Microfiber-knot resonator Erbium-doped fiber laser 1 Introduction Microfiber resonators have recently gained increasing research interest for their potential applications in integrated photonic circuits designs to serve a multitude of applications ranging from wavelength conversion and modulation [1,2], tunable laser outputs [3,4] and to create optical time delays [5], as well as in sensing applications such as temperature [6–8] and magnetic fields [9]. As a result of its flexibility and wide range of applications, multiple microfiber resonators designs and configurations have been explored, including micro-ring resonators [10–12], Mach-Zehnder interferometers [13] and micro-knot resonators (MKRs) [14–26] among others. However, it is the MKR in particular that shows the highest potential for manipulation and configuration due to its firm structure, as well as being able to support single-mode transmissions and exhibiting stable light coupling, thus making it a highly preferred microfiber design. MKR based sensors excel in the measurement of temperature, as even a minor change in temperature will see a major shift of the output spectrum from the MKR. The MKR has been successfully operated as a temperature sensor, exhibiting a responsivity of 0.27nm/°C [27], while a microfiber loop resonator was shown to have a linear extinction ratio reduction against temperature at a rate of approximately 0.043dB/°C when embedded in low refractive index polymer [22]. Though higher temperature resolutions can be achieved using other fiber based sensor designs, such as a photonic crystal fiber with a sensitivity of 54.3nm/°C [28], the corresponding measurement windows are typically narrow, thus rendering these sensor designs only useful for measurements of short temperature ranges. Furthermore, the fabrication process of the afore-mentioned sensors are more-often than not highly complex, require intensive processes such as femtosecond laser micromachining [29] as compared to the MKR which can easily fabricated and therefore at a much lower cost. In this work, an MKR designed to operate as both a temperature sensor and fiber laser is proposed and demonstrated. The primary advantage of the proposed MKR is that it can be easily fabricated, thus allowing for significant cost-savings to be realized as well as allowing for a compact and rugged sensor and laser system to be developed. Furthermore, MKR based sensors also enjoys significant advantages over conventional temperature sensors through passive operation and electromagnetic immunity, thus giving it significant potential for real-world applications. 2 Background The MKR’s theory of operation is similar to that of a loop resonator in a single loop. In this manner, the microfiber in the loop is represented by the two arms, which represent the in-going and out-going signals as shown in Fig. 1 . L is the length of the microfiber in which the electromagnetic field propagates along, and can be described by the equation [30–33]: (1) F ( r ) = e xp [ ( i ∫ ∫ 0 1 β ( L ) d L ( r ) ] where β(L) represents the propagation constant and F(r) is the local transverse mode that corresponds to the propagation constant. The coupling region has a coefficient of k and represents the mode interaction loss between the coupled microfiber arms. Thus, k =0 indicates no cross-coupling interaction between the two arms while k =1 indicates complete cross-coupling between the modes propagating in the MKR’s two arms. The transmission amplitude of the MKR can be expressed as [10]: (2) T = e − α L / 2 e i β L − sin ( K ) 1 − sin ( K ) e − α L / 2 e i β L where sin(K) is represent the intensity of coupling ratio. K can be defined as K=kl, where k and l are the coupling coefficient and the length of the coupling region respectively. The factor e−αL/2 represents the round-trip attenuation, with α being the intensity attenuation. The spacing between two resonant wavelengths, otherwise known as the free spectral range (FSR) is defined as: (3) Δλ ≈ λ 2/neffπD where λ is the wavelength resonance, neff is the effective refractive index and D is the diameter of the MKR. 3 Fabrication of the MKR The MKR is fabricated from a commercially available single mode fiber (SMF) using the flame brushing technique. The details of the fabrication process used in this work has been described in detail in reference [34]. The SMF-28 fiber was fixed onto the linear stages of the fabrication rig, with the middle portion creating a ‘loop’. This allows the middle portion, which will be tapered, to be fully exposed to the flame, without any obstructions. The transmission through the MKR during the fabrication process was monitored using an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source and an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA). A microfiber with the diameter of 8μm was formed in this work, with a loss after tapering of about 2.5dB. The transmission spectra of the injected ASE signal before and after it passes through the MKR is given in Fig. 2 . Once tapered, the microfiber is carefully removed from the stages, and a ‘loop is formed by gently bending the microfiber so that the tapered part overlaps. The “loop” being held between the thumb and finger, and the fiber is gently pulled to reduce the loop’s diameter. Initially, this is done by hand, and once a diameter of about 8cm is obtained, the loop is then secured again between the stages so that the diameter of the loop can be further reduced. The entire fabrication process is completed in less than 15min, including tapering time. The advantage of this technique is that a high quality MKR can be produced through just minute movements of the stages and monitored by the transmission spectra, thus eliminating the need for complex setups and expensive equipment such as high-resolution microscopes. 4 MKR as a temperature sensor To demonstrate the temperature sensing capabilities of the fabricated MKR, a knot resonator with a diameter of 1.3mm is assembled using an 8-μm diameter silica microfiber. The optical image of the microfiber is shown in Fig. 3 , while the setup used to measure the temperature response of the MKR is given in Fig. 4 . The MKR insertion loss is 17.6dB, which is attributed to both absorption loss and also bending loss [35]. The MKR is placed on a hotplate with a range of 20–100°C, while an ASE light source is placed at the input of the fiber. An OSA is connected to the output end of the microfiber to check the change in the comb spectrum as a result of the shifting temperature. The initial temperature of the hotplate is set to 27°C and the temperature is increased gradually. Fig. 5 shows the transmission spectrum of the resonator. As can be seen from the figure, the resonant wavelength shifts towards the longer wavelength region as the temperature increases. Due to the detection range of the OSA, a temperature sensing range of between 27–95°C can be obtained. The peak values of resonant wavelength at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that the wavelength increases in an almost linear fashion as the temperature increases, giving a slope value of about 0.0145pm/°C, while the power of the transmitted spectrum has an inverse response, decreasing at a rate of −224pm/°C. The measured sensitivity of the MKR is approximately −224dB/°C, in terms of change of power against temperature, or 14.5pm/°C as a function of the variation of wavelength as the temperature increases. 5 MKR as a fiber laser The MKR is also characterized for its ability to generate a multi-wavelength output from a conventional fiber laser cavity. In this regard, the fabricated MKR is integrated into a conventional erbium doped fiber laser (EDFL) cavity, as shown in Fig. 7 . The proposed laser uses a 3-m-long erbium-doped fiber (EDF) as the linear gain medium, and is pumped by a 980nm laser diode (LD) through a 980-nm/1550nm wavelength division multiplexer (WDM), with the 980nm port of the WDM connected to the pump LD and the common port of the WDM connected to one end of the 3m long EDF. The other end of the EDF is connected to the fabricated MKR, which acts as a comb filter in the proposed laser cavity and subsequently to a polarization controller (PC), which is used to adjust the polarization state of circulating light. The output from the PC is now tapped by a 90:10 output coupler, in which approximately 10% of the propagating signal is tapped for further analysis. The remaining 90% of the signal is emitted through the coupler’s 90% port, which is connected to a polarization dependent isolator (PDI) to ensure unidirectional signal propagation in the cavity as well as induce spectral filtering in combination with the PC and intra-cavity birefringence. Finally, the output of the PDI is connected to the 1550nm port of the WDM, thus completing the cavity. A Yokogawa AQ6370C OSA is used to perform a spectral analysis of the obtained signal. The lasing threshold of the fiber laser is determined to be about 20mW. For this work, the maximum pump power is set to 250mW to prevent possible damage to the components of the cavity. Fig. 8 (a) shows a dual wavelength output obtained at lasing wavelengths of 1564.72 and 1569.01nm with the same peak power of 19.622dBm. The wavelength spacing between the lasing wavelengths is about 4.29nm. It is worthwhile to observe that the lasing peaks overlap with the peaks observed from the ASE comb. Furthermore, fine adjustments to the polarization of the propagating signal in the cavity allows three lasing wavelengths to be obtained at 1564.62, 1568.88 and 1573.08nm and with all three wavelengths having the speak powers of 19.51dBm and channel spacing of 4.26nm. This is shown in Fig. 8(b). In addition, further refinements of the PC enable the generation of quadruple wavelength laser at 1564.62, 1568.83, 1573.04 and 1577.25nm shown in Fig. 8(c), with equal peak powers of around 17.28dBm and channel spacing of 4.29nm between each lasing wavelength. The channel spacing between the dual-, triple- and quadruple-lasing wavelengths are a result of the FSR of the MKR. The lasing wavelengths can be generated over a range of 25nm and centered at 1565nm. To verify the stability of the proposed MKR based multiwavelength fiber laser at room temperature, the output is measured repeatedly at 2-min intervals for a period of 20min. These results are presented in Fig. 9 (a)–(c). Fig. 10 shows the of power fluctuation details on the left hand side (LHS) and wavelength shifting on the right hand side (RHS) for dual, triple and quad wavelength lasing. As can be seen, the maximum power fluctuation is less than 0.6dBm while the wavelength shift is less than 0.01nm. These minor fluctuations can be attributed to physical perturbations of the fiber, such as temperature changes or vibrations, as well as due to minor instability caused by the light travelling within the cladding instead of being confined solely within the core. This however can be easily overcome by more stringent control of the environment. Thus, the proposed fiber laser is capable of generating a highly stable output that will have multiple applications in telecommunications and sensing. 6 Conclusion A single MKR is successfully fabricated by the flame brushing technique in this paper. The MKR shows remarkable stability as a sensor and is capable of measuring a temperature range of 27–95°C. In addition, a stable multiwavelength EDFL is also demonstrated using the MKR as a compact comb filter. Up to four lasing lines with a channel spacingof 4.29nm is obtained, as a result of the MKR’s FSR. The multiwavelength fiber laser shows good stability at room temperature and demonstrates that the MKR could be employed as a high performance comb filter to realize a compact multiwavelength fiber laser.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.026,Time domain transport equations of light in multilayered rectangular biological tissue with semi-infinite medium,"Abstract In the study of tissue optics, physical models with the boundary of finite size are rarely established. Based on the diffusion equation, under the rectangular boundary conditions, this paper adopts extrapolation boundary conditions to establish a frequency domain model of multilayer medium diffusion equation, according to Fourier transform of frequency domain, turns the frequency domain solution into time domain model. On the basis of the deduced equation, the corresponding calculation process is written and the time resolved diffuse reflectance is calculated. The established model is compared with Monte Carlo simulation of time domain and the traditional medium with semi-infinite thickness, the result shows that our theory is correct. Concurrently, the effects of different boundary conditions on the diffusion equation are compared, it shows that our equations can not only solve the finite boundary problems, when the boundary is infinite, it can replace multilayer medium diffusion model.",Feb-18," Keywords Diffusion equation Monte Carlo simulation Tissue optics Time resolved diffuse reflectance 1 Introduction Diffusion equations are widely used in biomedical optics, which can retrieve the optical characteristics of tissues and can perform noninvasive detection of biological tissues. Therefore, the diffusion model is one of the most widely used models, the diffusion model of medium with semi-infinite thickness is widely applied therein, for example, Haskell [1] established the time domain and steady-state model of partial flow boundary conditions, zero boundary conditions and extrapolation boundary conditions. But these studies are single layer medium models, while many different parts of the human body show a layered structure, such as head or limbs, Monte Carlo model can solve multilayered media, but it costs time. Liemer et al. [2,3] established biological tissue model of double layered medium with semi-infinite thickness, gave the exact solutions to diffusion equation in steady-state, time domain and frequency domain. We established multilayered medium model and the exact solutions to the steady-state, time domain and frequency domain [4,5]. Martelli et al. [6–9] presented the characteristic function method and perturbation model to solve two-layer and three-layer problems. Based on our studies, Liemer et al. [10,11] gave the exact solutions to the steady state, time domain and frequency domain of multilayer flat model of biological tissues, their solutions are very close to ours, the difference is that we give the model of multilayered medium with semi-infinite thickness, Liemer et al. give multilayer flat medium model. On this basis, someone [12] gives a mixed medium model, which uses a parameter of P3 approximation instead of the diffusion coefficient. These models only solved issues on multilayer medium infinite in horizontal (X or Y) coordinate. In fact, the medium is finite on horizontal coordinate, so Liemer et al. [13,14] established a diffusion equation of cylindrical medium, while we need to build a cube diffuse model. First, the cube structure is often used in experiments, and corresponding solutions are needed. Second, for in vivo experiments, cube geometry can be used to describe most parts of the human body, such as arms, legs, or fingers. Of course, these examples are not completely described by the cube, but surely, the cube geometry assumption is more accurate than the mainstream semi-infinite geometry. To this end, a rectangular tissue frequency domain transmission equation of medium with semi-infinite thickness is formed. Fourier transform of different frequency domain converts into time domain, in order to check correctness of the equation, it is verified by Monte Carlo simulation and compared with the traditional models, and the result shows that our theory is correct. 2 Theory In the following, we establish and give the frequency domain transmission equations of light in multilayered biological tissue. Let a beam of light vertically irradiate rectangular biological medium, its circular frequency isω, as shown in Fig. 1 . The rectangular biological tissue is 2a long, 2b wide, the medium has n-layers and the thickness of the last layer (Layer n) is infinite, rectangular coordinate system is used. When the beam is irradiating vertically, the light scatters in the tissue at a depth of z=z0 (=1/(μ′s1 +μa1)). Here, μ′si is reduced scattering coefficient of Layer i, μai is absorption coefficient of Layer i, μ’si =μsi(1-gi), μsi is scattering coefficient of Layer i, g is isotropic factor, Axis Z is direction of incident light wherein, Li is thickness of each layer, Di =1/3(μ′si +μai) is diffusion coefficient. The incident point of light source isδ(x − x 0)δ(y − y 0)δ(z − z 0), assume it is matching medium, so the multilayer diffusion equation can be changed to (1) D 1 Δ Φ 1 ( r ) − ( μ a 1 + j ω c ) Φ 1 ( r ) = − δ ( x − x 0 ) δ ( y − y 0 ) δ ( z − z 0 ) , 0 ≤ z < L 1 (2) D i . Δ Φ i ( r ) − ( μ a i + j ω c ) Φ i ( r ) = 0 , L i − 1 ≤ z < L i 2 ≤ i ≤ n We use the extrapolation boundary conditions, that is, at the side, the boundary of the square, the boundary conditions are (3) Φ ( a + z b i , y , z , ω ) = 0 , Φ ( − a − z b , y , z , ω ) = 0 Φ ( x , − b − z b , z , ω ) = 0 , Φ ( x , − b − z b , z , ω ) = 0 At the junction of the upper surface and the medium boundary, it satisfies the equations (4) Φ i ( x , y , − z b 1 , ω ) = 0 (5) Φ i ( x , y , L i , ω ) Φ i + 1 ( x , y , L i , ω ) = 1 i = 1 , 2 , … .. , n − 1 (6) D i ∂ Φ i ( x , y , L i , ω ) ∂ z | L i = D i + 1 ∂ Φ i + 1 ( x , y , L i , ω ) ∂ z | z = L i i = 1 , 2 , … .. , n − 1 (7) Φ n ( x , y , ∞ b , ω ) = 0 Here, zbi can be calculated according to literatures. After detailed derivation, we can derive the diffuse model of N-layered tissue as (8) Φ i ( ω , x , y , z ) = ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∑ m = 0 ∞ f i ( x ) f i ( y ) f ( z , ω ) W h e r e f i ( x ) = 2 a cos ( n + 0 .5 ) π a + z b i x 0 cos ( n + 0.5 π ) a + z b i x (9) f i ( y ) = 2 b cos (m + 0 .5) π b + z b i y 0 cos ( m + 0.5 ) π b + z b y S u p p o s e a i 2 = ( D i ( ( n + 0.5 ) π a + z b i ) 2 + ( ( m + 0.5 ) π b + z b i ) 2 ] + μ a i + j ω c ) / D i We can get fi(z,ω) of Layer i (10) f 1 ( z ) = sinh a 1 ( z b + z 0 ) D 1 a 1 × D 1 a 1 l 1 cosh a 1 ( L 1 − z ) + D 2 a 2 m 1 sinh a 1 ( L 1 − z ) D 1 a 1 l 1 cosh a 1 ( L 1 + z b ) + D 2 a 2 m 1 sinh a 1 ( L 1 + z b ) − sinh [ a 1 ( z 0 − z ) D 1 a 1 0 ≤ z < z 0 (11) f 1 ( z ) = = sinh a 1 ( z b + z 0 ) D 1 a 1 × D 1 a 1 l 1 cosh a 1 ( L 1 − z ) + D 2 a 2 m 1 sinh a 1 ( L 1 − z ) D 1 a 1 l 1 cosh a 1 ( L 1 + z b ) + D 2 a 2 m 1 sinh a 1 ( L 1 + z b ) z 0 ≤ z < L 1 f i + 1 ( z ) = sinh a 1 ( z b + z 0 ) D 1 a 1 ∐ ( D i a i l i ) ∐ ( h i ) × [ D i + 1 a i + 1 l i + 1 cosh ( a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − z ) ) + D i + 2 a i + 2 m i + 1 sinh ( a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − z ) ) ] D i + 1 a i + 1 l i + 1 cosh a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − L i ) + D i + 2 a i + 2 m i + 1 ( sinh a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − L i ) (12) 2≤i +1≤n-1 (13) f n ( z ) = cos ( sinh a 1 ( z b + z 0 ) D 1 a 1 × ∐ ( D n − 1 a n − 1 l n − 1 ) ∐ ( h n − 1 ) × exp ( a 3 ( L n − 1 − z ) (14) Where mn–1 = 1, ln–1 = 1 (15) m n − 2 = D n a n cosh a n − 1 ( L n − 1 − L n − 2 ) + D n − 1 a n − 1 sinh a n − 1 ( L n − 1 − L n − 2 ) (16) l n − 2 = D n a n sinh a n − 1 ( L n − 1 − L n − 2 ) + D n − 1 a n − 1 cosh a n − 1 ( L n − 1 − L n − 2 ) (17) m i = D i + 1 a i + 1 l i + 1 sinh a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − L i ) + D i + 2 a i + 2 m i + 1 cosh a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − L i ) (18) l i = D i + 1 a i + 1 l i + 1 cosh a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − L i ) + D i + 2 a i + 2 m i + 1 sinh a i + 1 ( L i + 1 − L i ) ] (19) ∐ ( D i a i l i ) = ( D 1 a 1 l 1 ) × ( D 2 a 2 l 2 ) × ( ⋯ ) × D i a i l i (20) h 1 = D 1 a 1 l 1 cosh a 1 ( L 1 + z b ) + D 2 a 2 m 1 sinh a 1 ( L 1 + z b ) (21) h i = D i a i l i cosh a i ( L i − L i − 1 ) + D i + 1 a i + 1 m i ( sinh a i ( L i − L i − 1 ) (22) ∐ h i = h 1 × h 2 × ( ⋯ ) × h i Thus, the frequency domain diffusion equation of rectangular biological tissue with semi-infinite thickness is established and its exact solutions are given. 3 Time domain studies are compared with Monte Carlo simulation and related models The diffusion equation is converted into reflectance to verify the correctness of the equation. The method [1] of Haskell is adopted, that is, Formula (23) (23) R ( x , y ) = C 1 Φ ( x , y , z = 0 ) + C 2 D ∂ Φ ( x , y , z = 0 ) ∂ z Here, if refractive index of the biological tissue is 1.4, C1 =0.118,C2 =0.306 3.1 Comparison with Monte Carlo simulation Calculate the diffuse reflectance of various frequencies and carry out Fourier transform, that is, the method and the frequency of Kienle [5] are adopted. At the same time, Monte Carlo simulation [15] is used for verification. In order to verify correctness of the model, we verified the diffusion equations of two-layer, three-layer, four-layer and five-layer media separately, each location selected is y=0mm, x=10.5mm. Assume rectangular boundary of a=45mm and b=45mm. From Figs. 2–5 , the solid line is calculation result of the model, and the dotted line is the result of Monte Carlo simulation.

From Fig. 2–5, there are four graphs, we can see that our diffuse model is matched with Monte Carlo simulation completely, which proves that our diffuse model is correct. 3.2 Comparison with model of multilayer medium with semi-infinite thickness We have published a model of multilayer medium with semi-infinite thickness [4,5]. In the model of medium with semi-infinite thickness, assume the medium is infinitely long in X direction and Y direction, and cylindrical coordinates are used. We calculate rectangular medium model at y=0 and x=10.5mm, compare it with the model of medium with semi-infinite thickness when ρ=10.5, assume the rectangular medium boundary of a=60mm, b=60mm, when measuring time resolved diffuse reflectance at y=0, x=10.5mm, the boundary can be deemed infinite. We calculate time-resolved diffuse reflectance of the two models; the parameters of Fig. 5 are selected. At the same time, we calculate the relative error. In Fig. 6 , the solid line is the rectangular medium model, the dashed line is the model of medium with semi-infinite thickness, we can see the two graphs are coincident, hardly see the difference. Among relative errors in Fig. 7 , except for the first 3 points, other relative errors are less than 0.1%, indicating the model of multilayered medium with semi-infinite thickness can be replaced by our rectangular medium model. In addition, we calculate the effects of different boundaries on time domain diffusion equation, the parameters of Fig. 5 are utilized. We employ rectangular boundaries of a=b=30mm, a=b=20mm, a=b=15mm, and a=b=13mm respectively, calculate time resolved diffuse reflectance at y=0, x=10.5mm, the result is shown in Fig. 8 , which proves that different boundaries heavily affect time resolved diffuse reflectance in the same position. It also indicates that our equation can not only replace the equation of medium with semi-infinite thickness, but also solve the problems which the equation of medium with semi-infinite thickness can not solve. 4 Conclusions Under extrapolation boundary conditions, we establish a frequency domain model of multilayer medium diffusion equation of rectangular boundary conditions. With Fourier transform of various frequency domains, it is converted to time domain and verified by Monte Carlo simulation, the method is proved to be correct. A.Liemer et al. proposed a diffusion equation of cylindrical tissues, but the form of the solutions is more complex, while our equation is simpler in form than those of Liemer et al. and the application range will be more extensive. Compared with the model of medium with semi-infinite thickness, it shows that the model of medium with semi-infinite thickness can be replaced by the rectangular medium model, so the rectangular media model is more comprehensive. In some diffusion equation models, one layer medium models or multilayered medium models are infinite in both X and Y directions, up to now, no diffusion model of rectangular boundary conditions has been established. Our model can solve the problems which the equation of medium with semi-infinite thickness can not solve.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.055,Field intensity of a perfect electromagnetic conductor circular reflector coated with a plasma layer under oblique incidence,"Abstract A theoretical analysis to study the effects of plasma layer on the field intensity distribution of electromagnetic wave in the focal region of perfect electromagnetic conductor (PEMC) circular reflector under oblique incidence is carried out. The reflection and transmission coefficients at dielectric-plasma and plasma-PEMC boundaries are solved systematically using electromagnetic boundary conditions. Maslov’s method have been used to obtain in focal region of plasma coated PEMC circular reflector. The numerical computations has been applied using MATHEMATICA to solve the analytical integral. The effects of angle of incidence, effective collision frequency, the plasma frequency and the width of plasma coating layer on the fields in image space or focal region have been studied. The obtained computed results are compare with the already published literature under special conditions which confirm the correctness of presented data.",Feb-18," Keywords PEMC Image field Plasma layer Circular reflector 1 Introduction Research based on electromagnetic waves propagation in ionized gases such as plasma material has received much attention in the recent years. Many researchers studied the plasma materials for applications in optical devices such as absorbers, waveguides and mirrors [1,2]. Hereafter, use of plasma for advanced technologies in optical device applications, millimeter-wave, and microwave, is imperious [3–9]. Furthermore, abundant of research has been carried out in the previous five decades relevant to transmission and reflection of from plasma based antenna and their uses by many scientist [10,11]. This visible investigations explored many features of reflector or transmitter for example intensity, polarization, power, and apparent inaccuracies in demand to improve the efficiency of these devices for high frequencies spectrum and applications [12,13]. In last years the knowledge of focusing of electromagnetic waves in the focal region by plasma coated antenna as reflector or absorbers is vital in the current arena of advanced technologies for communication applications. The study of image space is useful for optical devices, medical investigations and treatment [14–16]. This field can be also useful to produce pictures of the internal body with the help of high frequency. When space vehicles with high speed along with metallic antennas enter from space into the Earth’s atmosphere encounter plasma influence. Thus, space vehicles’ antennas are covered with plasma layer that upsets the electromagnetic properties of such antennas [10,17]. In the same way, the presence of a plasma layer on targets can affects the transmitted and reflected power energies. The research is very important to obtain the factors of plasma, which mainly affect the reflected, absorbed, and transmitted power energy of the electromagnetic wave for contact with curvy metallic interfaces. It is theoretically proved that the perfect electromagnetic conductor PEMC material behaves as reflector of electromagnetic energy but it is different from the perfect electric conductor PEC and the perfect magnetic conductor PMC having additional reflected cross polarized components [18]. The perfect electromagnetic conductor (PEMC) is a general arrangement of both the perfect electric conductor (PEC) and the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC). Many researchers carried out research on PEMC materials [19–21]. The geometrical optics (GO) is a famous procedure used to obtain the high frequency field. However, in numerous cases, such as relating electromagnetic field in the region of the image space, the said technique does not provide suitable outcomes [22]. To remove this error of GO, Maslov’s method is used, which combine the asymptotic ray theory (ART) and Fourier transform method [23–26]. Maslov’s method, expresses the ray in terms of components of wave vectors and space coordinates with mixed six coordinates. The conventional ray expression may be considered as its projection in the space coordinates. At the singular point of the ray-expression in space coordinates, the six-component expression is employed. The expression in the hybrid coordinates may be transformed into that of space coordinates through Fourier transform. This technique has been used to study high frequency fields in the focal region successfully by many authors [27–33]. In this paper, we consider a long metallic circular reflector coated with a collision plasma layer on its surface under oblique incidence. The reflection and transmission coefficients at free space-plasma and plasma-perfect electromagnetic conductor interfaces have been derived analytically. The electromagnetic field intensity in the caustic or focal region of this circular reflector has been derived using Maslov’s method. The effects of angle of incidence, plasma’s parameters such as the, admittance parameter, plasma frequency and effective collision frequency and the thickness of plasma layer on the focal regions field transmitted and reflected from plasma layer have been studied. The results of the presented formulations have been compared with the published results of some special cases which confirm the accuracy of the presented analysis. 2 Methods and formulation Consider a circular reflector made of perfect metal in the presence of plasma layer as shown in Fig. 1 , equation of surface of metallic circular reflector is given as (1) ζ = a 2 − ξ 2 where a is the radius of the metallic circular reflector. Then, the equation of the circular plasma layer placed on the metallic circular reflector is defined as follows: (2) ζ = p 2 − ξ 2 where p = a 2 − d 2 is the radius of the circular plasma layer, a is the radius of the circular metallic circular reflector and d is the thickness of the plasma layer. According to the mathematical concept, coordinates of a point on the circular surface of the plasma layer P ( ξ 0 , ζ 0 ) in terms of a point on the metallic circular reflector Q(ξ, ζ) are defined as [7] (3) ξ 0 = ξ − d sin α (4) ζ 0 = ζ − d cos α Now, we consider a monochromatic electromagnetic wave polarized in y-axis obliquely incident with an angle θ0 on the circular plasma layer, parallel to its symmetry axis as [6,15] (5) E 0 i = E i e ˆ y exp [ − j k i ( x sin θ 0 + z cos θ 0 ) ] As a plane wave is made incident obliquely on the plasma circular reflector, the wave vector of the reflected wave and transmitted wave can be worked out by using Snell’s laws of whose mathematical expression is described in the following form (6) P r = P i − 2 ( P i . N ) N (7) Q r = P i + n 2 − 1 + ( P i . N ) 2 N − ( P i . N ) N where Pi is the wave vector of the incident wave, n is refractive index of plasma medium and N is unit normal to the surface of the circular reflector coated with plasma layer can be written as (8) N = e ˆ z cos α + e ˆ x sin α By applying Snell’s law of reflection and refraction the wave vector P1 of the reflected wave from plasma circular layer, the wave vector Q1 of the refracted wave into plasma circular layer, the wave vector P2 of the reflected wave from metallic circular reflector and the wave vector Q2 of the refracted wave from plasma circular layer in to free space are given by [11] (9) P 1 = − e ˆ x sin ( 2 α − θ 0 ) − e ˆ z cos ( 2 α − θ 0 ) (10) Q 1 = e ˆ x ( sin α ( − cos ( α − θ 0 ) + n 2 − sin 2 ( α − θ 0 ) ) + sin θ 0 ) − e ˆ z ( cos α ( − cos ( α − θ 0 ) + n 2 − sin 2 ( α − θ 0 ) ) + cos θ 0 ) (11) P 2 = − e ˆ x ( K 1 sin α + cos α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) − e ˆ z ( K 1 cos α − sin α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) (12) Q 2 = − e ˆ x ( K 2 sin α + ncos α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) − e ˆ z ( K 2 cos α − nsin α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) where K 1 = ( − 1 + 2 n 2 + cos ( 2 α − 2 θ 0 ) ) / 2 K 2 = ( 2 + n ( − 1 + 2 ( − 1 + n ) n ) + n cos ( 2 α − 2 θ 0 ) ) / 2 . The Jacobian associated with wave reflected by the circular plasma layer is obtained (13) J 1 ( τ 1 ) = D 1 ( τ 1 ) D 1 ( 0 ) = τ 1 − cos α 2 p The Jacobian associated with wave refracted by the plasma circular layer after reflection from metallic circular layer is obtained (14) J 2 ( τ 2 ) = D 2 ( τ 2 ) D 2 ( 0 ) = 1 2 a K 2 2 ( 2 a ( 2 + n ( − 1 + 2 ( − 1 + n ) n ) ) + K 2 ( − 2 + n + n 2 − 2 n 3 ) τ 2 − 2 2 n ( 1 + ( − 1 + n ) n 2 ) τ 2 cos ( α − θ 0 ) + n ( 2 a + K 2 ( − 1 + n ) τ 2 ) cos ( 2 α − 2 θ 0 ) ) The fields expressions for the reflected and transmitted rays out of the plasma layer in geometric optics are obtained as under [13–18] (15) E r ( x , z ) = E i [ J 1 ( τ ) ] − 1 2 e x p [ − j k ( Ψ 0 + τ 1 ) ] (16) E t ( x , z ) = E i [ J 2 ( τ ) ] − 1 2 e x p [ − j k ( Ψ 0 + τ 2 + t ) ] where Ψ 0 = p cos ( α − θ 0 ) , τ 1 and τ 2 are parameter along the ray reflected from circular plasma layer and transmitted ray out of circular plasma layer to focal point respectively and t is the distance between the P(ξ0,ζ0) and Q(ξ, ζ). It is observed that the GO field the reflected and the transmitted wave becomes infinity at the Caustic points as is expected when J(τ)=0. We can derive the expression which is valid at the focal point using the Maslov’s method. The exact location of focal or caustic point may also be obtained at J(τ)=0. According to Maslov’s method valid field expressions in focal region can be written as below [9–18]. (17) E r ( r ) = k j 2 π ∫ − ∞ ∞ [ D ( τ ) D ( 0 ) ∂ ( p z ) ∂ ( z ) ] − 1 2 exp { − jk [ S 0 + τ − z ( p x , z ) p z + p z z ] } d p z Integrand and phase function of integral for transmitted field from plasma layer is obtained as (18) Q = D ( τ ) D ( 0 ) ∂ ( p x ) ∂ ( x ) = 1 2 a K 2 ( 2 n 2 cos α ( K 2 + cos ( α − θ 0 ) sin 2 ( α − θ 0 ) + K 2 sin α ( 4 K 2 n sin ( α − θ 0 ) + n ( 1 + n ) sin ( 2 α − 2 θ 0 ) + 2 K 2 ( K 2 + n cos ( α − θ 0 ) ) Tan α ) ) S = S 0 + τ 2 + t − z ( x , p z ) p z + p x x = S 0 + τ 2 − ξ 0 p x − ζ 0 p z + p x x + p z z (19) S = p cos ( α − θ 0 ) + a K 2 − d K 2 − K 2 r cos ( α + θ ) + a cos ( α − θ 0 ) + n r sin ( α + θ ) sin ( α − θ 0 ) + ( ξ 0 − ξ ) 2 + ( ζ 0 − ζ ) 2 Similarly the integrand and phase function for the integral of field reflected from plasma coated circular reflector can be obtained easily. The final reflected field expression from plasma coated circular reflector valid at the focal point is obtained using Maslov’s method can be written as (20) E ( x , z ) E i = k a π ∫ − l / 2 l / 2 cos ( α − θ 0 ) × e x p [ − j k ( 2 acos ( α − θ 0 ) − rcos ( θ + 2 α − θ 0 ) − d sin ( 2 α 1 − α 2 − θ 0 ] ) ) ] d α To obtain initial value of reflected field E r 0 ( x , z ) on PEMC circular reflector we applied PEMC boundary conditions. The boundary conditions at the surface of the PEMC (21) n × ( H + M E ) = 0 n ⋅ ( D − M B ) = 0 } where n is the unit normal, and M is the admittance parameter characterizing the PEMC. The values M=0 and M →±∞, correspond to PMC and PEC respectively. The electromagnetic energy cannot enter into the PEMC region because that the pointing vector is complex and imaginary [19]. Using above boundary conditions we get (22) E r 0 ( x , z ) = [ 1 − ( Mη 0 ) 2 ( Mη 0 ) 2 + 1 e ˆ x − 2 Mη 0 ( Mη 0 ) 2 + 1 e ˆ y ] E i The reflected field from PEMC circular reflector incident to plasma curve. The initial value of the transmitted field is related with the incident field from PEMC circular reflector by the relation (23) E t ( x , z ) = T ˜ ⋅ E r o = [ T ∥ i ∥ t i ∥ i + T ⊥ i ⊥ t i ⊥ i ] ⋅ E r o The unit vector corresponding to these components are obtained using following relations i ⊥ i = P i × n | P i × n | = e ˆ y , i ∥ i = i ⊥ i × P i = cos θ 0 e ˆ x − sin θ 0 e ˆ z , i ⊥ t = q i × n | q i × n | = e ˆ y , i ∥ t = i ⊥ i × q i = − ( K 2 cos α + n sin α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) e ˆ x − ( K 2 sin α + n cos α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) e ˆ z T ∥ = 2 ncos α cos α + n 1 − n 2 sin 2 α T ⊥ = 2 ncos α ncos α + 1 − n 2 sin 2 α Using above equations the co polarized transmitted field from plasma coated circular reflector at the focal point are obtained (24) E x ( x , z ) E i = − k a π ∫ − l / 2 l / 2 E x ( x , z ) E i = − k a π ∫ − l / 2 l / 2 2 ncos α ( K 2 cos α + n sin α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) cos α + n 1 − n 2 sin 2 α 1 − ( Mη 0 ) 2 ( Mη 0 ) 2 + 1 cos θ 0 1 q 2 x d q 2 z d α cos ( α − θ 0 ) × e x p [ − j k ( p cos ( α − θ 0 ) + a K 2 − d K 2 − K 2 r cos ( α + θ ) + a cos ( α − θ 0 ) + n r sin ( α + θ ) sin ( α − θ 0 ) + t ) ] d α (25) E z ( x , z ) E i = k a π ∫ − l / 2 l / 2 2 ncos α ( K 2 sin α + n cos α sin ( α − θ 0 ) ) cos α + n 1 − n 2 sin 2 α 1 − ( Mη 0 ) 2 ( Mη 0 ) 2 + 1 sin θ 0 1 q 2 x d q 2 z d α cos ( α − θ 0 ) × e x p [ − j k ( p cos ( α − θ 0 ) + a K 2 − d K 2 − K 2 r cos ( α + θ ) + a cos ( α − θ 0 ) + n r sin ( α + θ ) sin ( α − θ 0 ) + t ) ] d α The cross polarized transmitted field from plasma coated circular reflector at the focal point is obtained as (26) E y ( x , z ) E i = − k a π ∫ − l / 2 l / 2 2 ncos α ncos α + 1 − n 2 sin 2 α 2 Mη 0 ( Mη 0 ) 2 + 1 1 q 2 x d q 2 z d α cos ( α − θ 0 ) × e x p [ − j k ( p cos ( α − θ 0 ) + a K 2 − d K 2 − K 2 r cos ( α + θ ) + a cos ( α − θ 0 ) + n r sin ( α + θ ) sin ( α − θ 0 ) + t ) ] d α l = s i n − 1 ( d / a ) is the angle which subtends the aperture. 3 Numerical result and discussion In this paper, optical focused electromagnetic field from a perfect electromagnetic conductor circular reflector coated by magnetized plasma is obtained under oblique angle of incident. Then the effects of admittance parameter, angle of incident, plasma frequency and effective collision frequency of plasma on the optical focused fields are discussed. The incident frequency of electromagnetic wave is taken as f=5×107 Hz and Mη0 =MZ throughout the manuscript. The numerical results are compared with the published literature to check the correctness of analytical calculations and also as well the working of software pack. By using MATHEMATICA software, the computations are made of Eqs. (20), (24) and (25). Fig. 2 shows the comparison at ka=4, MZ=∞, kd=0.5, θ0 =1°, ωp =1.7829×108 Hz and V=6.0×109 Hz for the focused fields from PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma layer, our study and previous study [24]. When plasma medium is replaced by the dielectric free space then the present work transforms into the published work as in [24] and good agreement is found between analytical and then numerical calculations. It is also noted that reflected field intensity decreases due to plasma coating. Fig. 3 a and b shows the comparison of the co polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material along x-axis and z-axis for the different values of admittance parameter respectively at ka=4, kd=0.5, θ0 =1°, ωp =1.7829×108 Hz and V=6.0×109 Hz. The solid, dotted, thick dashed, dashed and thick dotted lines show the result at MZ=∞, MZ=5.0, MZ=3 and MZ=0.5 for the co polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material along x-axis and z-axis respectively. Fig. 3a and b it is observed that at MZ=∞ co polarized focused the field intensity corresponds to reflect from PEC circular reflectors and at intermediate values of admittance parameter the focused the field intensity corresponds to PEMC elliptical reflectors. It is also observed that field intensity shifts to a smaller value as we decrease the admittance parameter. Fig. 4 a and b shows the comparison of the cross polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material along x-axis and z-axis for the different values of admittance parameter respectively at ka=4, kd=0.5, θ0 =1°, ωp =1.7829×108 Hz and V=6.0×109 Hz. The solid, dotted, thick dashed, dashed and thick dotted lines show the result at MZ=∞, MZ=5.0, MZ=3 and MZ=0.5 for the co polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material along x-axis and z-axis respectively. Fig. 4a and b it is observed that at MZ=∞ and MZ=0 cross polarized focused field intensity vanishes. It is also observed that field intensity shifts to a higher value as we increase the admittance parameter. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the co polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material along z-axis around the focal point for the different values of plasma frequencies at ωp =3.08808×108 Hz(solidline),ωp =1.7829×108 Hz(dashed line) ωp =1.38103×108 Hz (dotted line), and ωp =7.63803×107 Hz(thick dotted line) respectively. From Fig. 4 it is observed that the field intensity shifts to a slightly smaller value as we increase the values of plasma frequency. In Figure it is assumed that at ka=4, kd=0.5, θ0 =1°, MZ=0.1 and V=6.0×109 Hz. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the co polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material along z-axis at ka=4, kd=0.5, θ0 =1°, ωp =1.7829×108 Hz and MZ=0.1 around the focal point for the different values of collision frequencies V=6.0×109 Hz(solidline),V=2.0×109 Hz(dashed line) V=8.0×108 Hz (dotted line), and V=4.0×108 Hz(thick dotted line) respectively. From Fig. 5 it is observed that the field intensity shifts to a slightly smaller value as we decrease the values of plasma frequency. Fig. 6 a and b shows the comparison of the co polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material at ka=4, kd=0.5, ωp =1.7829×108 Hz and V=6.0×109 Hz. along x-axis and z-axis for the different values of angle of incidence respectively. The solid, dotted, thick dashed, dashed and thick dotted lines show the result atθ0 =1°, θ0 =5°, θ0 =10° and θ0 =15° for the co polarized field intensity distribution of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material along x-axis and z-axis respectively. Fig. 6a and b it is observed that if angle of incidence increases the value of transmitted field decrease for both axes whereas focal point shift away from curved surface for x-axis and focal point shift toward curved surface for z-axis. Similarly result for cross polarized filed intensity can be obtained by same procedure. 4 Conclusion In this paper, the focusing of electromagnetic field through a PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material for oblique incidence is analyzed numerically by using Maslov’s method. The field distribution is presented in the form of numerical results for different parameters to clarify the focusing behavior of PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material. It is observed that the cross polarized field component appeared for PEMC circular reflector. It is clear from analysis of co polarized field component that at infinite value of admittance parameter PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material approaches to PEC circular reflector coated with plasma material. It is also observed that at null value of admittance parameter PEMC circular reflector coated with plasma material approaches to PMC circular reflector coated with plasma material. In case of cross polarized field component at infinite value and null value of admittance field cross polarized field component disappear. It is also observed that field intensity increases with decrease in angle of incidence. The focal point shift away and toward curved surface oppositely with the increase in angle of incidence.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.058,Self-focusing of Hermite-cosh-Gaussian laser beam in semiconductor quantum plasma,Abstract Self-focusing of Hermite-cosh-Gaussian (HchG) laser beam in semiconductor quantum plasma (ScQP) has been presented by considering the decentred parameter and quantum effect. We drive the equation of beam width parameter by using parabolic wave equation and solved it numerically by using WKB approximation. Our simulation results show that HchG beam gives freedom to source parameters that influence the self-focusing significantly. Additional self-focusing has been observed in ScQP than that of classical case of reference. The quantum plasma also adds pinching effect to laser propagation in semiconductor like germanium which further enhances the self-focusing more and more in ScQP.,Feb-18," Keywords Hermite-cosh-Gaussian (HchG) laser beam Semiconductor Self-focusing Quantum plasma 1 Introduction High power lasers interactions with plasmas and semiconductors have been a fascinating area of research during last few decades [1–4] due to its potential applications such as particle accelerations, laser-driven fusion, radiation generations, generation of magnetic fields etc. [5–7]. The effectiveness of laser beam in such applications is determined by the extended propagation without loss of energy. The penetration of laser beams in plasma generates various nonlinear phenomena’s (self-focusing, harmonic generation, electron acceleration etc.). Among these phenomena self-focusing is an important nonlinear phenomenon. In semiconductors the nonlinearities that are important in self-focusing appear through the redistribution of carriers and energy dependence mass of carriers. However, at low lattice temperatures, the rise in random energy of carriers is much greater than the drift energy. Therefore, the nonlinearities are mainly due to the redistribution of carriers [3]. Further, the semiconductors provides a platform to model nonlinear phenomena like self-focusing effectively due to its compact size and as a less expensive medium which ensures their practical applicability and possibilities of optical limiting devices [4]. There are two main mechanisms for the occurrence of nonlinear self-focusing of laser in semiconductors, non-parabolicity of conduction band and nonlocal effects. Apart from these two mechanisms, there is another mechanism which is due to intervallic transfer of carriers. This mechanism is however unimportant in Ge and in InSb but, is significant in semiconductors like GaAs which has been studied by Guha and Tripathi [8]. However, the self-focusing of electromagnetic beams due to free carrier nonlinearities is possible in a sample lengths for easily obtainable powers (P ≥20Win n-InSb at ω =1014 rad/sec). But, for the focusing of high frequency beams, the power of the beam has to be enhanced considerably. The temperature change of the carriers is important effect influencing self-focusing of laser in semiconductors because of their sensitiveness towards the change in carriers effective mass [9]. The laser (beam spot size and Rayleigh length) and plasma parameters (mainly density) are crucial for enhanced self-focusing in plasma [10–15]. Kant and Wani [16] studied the density transition on laser’s self-focusing in plasma. The effect of linear absorption in plasma weakens the effect of self-focusing whereas a density transition induces an earlier and effective self-focusing of laser. At small values of intensity and decentered parameters the self-focusing of HcosG laser beam in collisionless plasma becomes more focused [17]. Self-focusing is also sensitive to decentered parameter [18] and with a magnetic field of a few MG the self-focusing capacity of laser beam increases in rippled density plasma. With a suitable wavelength of density ripple in plasma, stronger and earlier self-focusing is achieved [19]. Frequency chirp also influences the self-focusing. The variation in chirp parameter from optimized values decreases the effect of defocusing and hence, increases the ability of self-focusing in collisional plasma [20]. Habibi and Ghamari [21] presented the higher order paraxial theory for the focusing of a cosh-Gaussian (chG) laser beam in quantum plasma. By choosing the suitable value of decentered parameter, better self-focusing is observed for chG laser beams in comparison with Gaussian beams. Furthermore, the quantum effect plays a pivotal role during laser interaction in plasma and effectively adds self-focusing in comparison to a classical relativistic case [22,23]. A plasma profile with upward density ramp causes a much higher oscillation and enhanced focusing in cold quantum plasma which includes the quantum effects [24]. In this investigation, we have analyzed the self-focusing of HchG laser beam propagating in semiconductor quantum plasma (ScQP). We consider a wave equation in paraxial approximation using HchG beam. Such beams can be generated experimentally by the interaction of two decentred HG beams as chG ones. Effects of decentred parameter, laser intensity and plasma density parameters are seen on the self-focusing of HchG laser beam in ScQP. We have found that a HchG laser beam when incident on ScQP, earlier self-focusing appears which becomes much stronger as quantum effect gives stronger beam localization to add the self-focusing. The paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents the equations governing the nonlinear dielectric constant and the characteristics of beam width parameter functioning the distance of propagation. Section 3 includes the results and discussions on the basis of considered parameters. Final conclusion is presented in Section 4. 2 Self-focusing Laser beam propagating through a dielectric medium is written in terms of a wave equation as: (1) ▽ 2 E ¯ + ( ω 2 c 2 ) ε E ¯ + ▽ ( E ¯ ▽ ε ε ) = 0. assuming k −2 ∇ 2(lnε)˂˂ 1, where, k is the wave number of the laser beam. Therefore, neglecting the last term on in Eq. (1). The wave equation becomes: (2) ▽ 2 E ¯ + ω 2 c 2 ( ε E ¯ ) = 0. The effective dielectric constant in ScQP can be defined as: (3) ε = ε 0 + Φ ( E E * ) , where, ε 0 = ε L − ω p 2 / ω 2 is the linear and Φ ( E E * ) ≈ ( 1 / 2 ) ε 2 A 0 2 is the nonlinear term of respectively, ε L is the lattice dielectric constant, ω p = ( 4 π N e e 2 / m * ) 1 / 2 is the plasma frequency, N e represents the concentration of electrons, m* is the effective electron mass, ω is the incident angular frequency of laser beam and e is the charge on electron. In semiconductors, the nonlinearities are due to the relative dependence of electron’s effective mass and temperature. The dielectric constant for quantum plasma is expressed as [25]: (4) ε = 1 − ω p 2 γ ω 2 ( 1 − δ q γ ) − 1 , With δq =4π 4 h 2/m 2 ω 2 λ 4, h is the Plank’s constant and γ = ( 1 + α E E * ) 1 / 2 is the relativistic factor. Further, α= e 2/m 2 ω 2 c 2, where, c is the speed of light in vacuum. Following [2], Φ(EE *) can be expressed as: (5) Φ ( E E * ) = ω p 2 ω 2 [ 1 − 1 γ ( 1 − δ q γ ) ] , Now, introducing, E = A(r, z)exp[i(ωt − kz)], where, A(r, z) representing the complex amplitude of electric field vector and its behaviour is described by the parabolic equation derived from Eq. (2). Employing the WKB approximation and considering the slow variations along longitudinal axis than that in radially, one obtains (6) − 2 i k ∂ A ∂ z + ∂ 2 A ∂ r 2 + 1 r ∂ A ∂ r + ω 2 c 2 Φ ( E E * ) A = 0 , In order to solve Eq. (6), we express A as (7) A ( r , z ) = A 0 ( r , z ) exp [ − i k S ( r , z ) ] , where, k = ( ω / c ) ε 0 1 / 2 , A 0 and S are real functions r and z (S represents the eikonal of the laser beam). Substituting Eqs. (5) and (7) in Eq. (6). Then the real and imaginary parts are separated as follow: (8) 2 ∂ S ∂ z + ( ∂ S ∂ r ) 2 = 1 k 2 A 0 2 [ 1 2 ∂ 2 A 0 2 ∂ r 2 − 1 4 A 0 2 ( ∂ A 0 2 ∂ r ) 2 + 1 2 r ∂ A 0 2 ∂ r ] + 1 ε 0 ( ω p 2 ω 2 ) [ 1 − 1 γ ( 1 − δ q γ ) ] , and (9) ∂ A 0 2 ∂ z + ( ∂ S ∂ r ) ( ∂ A 0 2 ∂ r ) + A 0 2 ( ∂ 2 S ∂ r 2 + 1 r ∂ S ∂ r ) = 0 , where, S =(r 2/2)β(z)+ ϕ(z),β(z)=(1/f)(∂f/∂z), β −1 is the radius of curvature of the laser beam and f(z) is the normalized beam width parameter. Further, for an HchG beam at z =0, (10) A 0 2 = E 0 2 4 f 2 exp ( b 2 2 ) [ exp { − 2 ( r r 0 f + b 2 ) 2 } + exp { − 2 ( r r 0 f − b 2 ) 2 } + 2 exp { − ( 2 r 2 r 0 2 f 2 + b 2 2 ) } ] , Substituting for S and A 0 2 in Eq. (8). Solving and equating the coefficients of r 2 in resulting equation. The second order differential equation functioning the nonlinear dependence of beam width parameter is obtained as follows: ∂ 2 f ∂ ξ 2 = 16 − b 2 ( 76 − 17 b 2 + 94 b 4 ) 4 f 3 − α E 0 2 ρ 0 2 4 f 3 ( ω p ω ) 2 exp ( b 2 2 ) × (11) × [ 4 − 8 δ q + 2 δ q ( 2 − b 2 ) ( α E 0 2 ) f 2 exp ( b 2 2 ) ] , where, ξ = z/R d is the normalized distance representing propagation, R d = k r 0 2 represents the diffraction length, ρ 0 = r 0 ω 0/c is the equilibrium beam radius. Hence, Eq. (11) represents the laser’s spot size variation with the propagation distance. 3 Results and discussion Eq. (11) is the second order differential equation regulating the nonlinear function of beam width parameter f with the propagation distance ξ for HchG laser beam in ScQP. Eq. (11) has been numerically solved by considering the initial condition at ξ =0, f =1, ( ∂ f / ∂ ξ ) = 0 and ( ∂ 2 f / ∂ ξ 2 ) = 0 for Nd: glass laser; angular frequency of laser ω =2×1015 rad/sec, laser wavelength λ =1.06μm. In semiconductor the energy transfer mechanism is dependent on the optical mode of scattering, thus we choose a case of non-parabolic semiconductor like n-InSb (n-type Indium Antimonide). By optimizing the plasma and laser parameters, the self-focusing has been investigated for HchG laser beam in ScQP. Fig. 1 shows the variation plots of beam width parameter f functioning normalized propagation distance ξ for distinct values of decentred parameter b. The other parameters are δq =0.52, α E 0 2 = 0.7 and ω p /ω =0.9. The self-focusing effect for beam is shown forb =0, 0.5 and 1. We depict that on increasing the values of decentred parameter in gradual steps a sharp self-focusing occurs for b =1 at shorter propagation distance of about ξ =0.01. This is due to the fact that in case of semiconductors, the decentred parameter when increased results in the reduction of self-focusing length. Consequently, the phenomenon of self-focusing gets enhanced more in ScQP. Fig. 2 shows the variation plot of beam width parameter f as a function of the normalized distance of propagation ξ for distinct values of relative plasma density ω p /ω. The decentred parameter is fixed at b =1 and the other parameters are same as taken in Fig. 1. It is observed that the laser beam converges in the region where plasma density is high. On increasing ω p /ω, the value of f decreases strongly with ξ and touches its minimum at ω p /ω =0.9, corresponding to ξ =0.01, thereby decreasing the amplitude of laser beam gradually closer to the axis of propagation. Hence, stronger self-focusing is observed at smaller ξ values. This is due to the fact that quantum effects are highly prominent in the region of higher plasma density. These results can be compared with the results presented by Kaur et al. [26]. Wherein, they considered that the two scale length makes the periodic oscillations of laser beam with a constant amplitude for a long distance of propagation. Thus, quantum effects offer stronger self-focusing than classical ones. Fig. 3 shows the variation plot of beam width parameter f vs normalized propagation distance ξ with various values of α E 0 2 for ScQP. The decentred parameter is fixed at b =1 and the rest of the parameters are same as taken in Fig. 1. The Fig. 3 demonstrates that the convergence of laser beam starts earlier with increase in α E 0 2 of the beam. Further, it is observed that the length for self-focusing decreases with the increase in intensity of the laser beam. This is on account of relativistic intensity that the beam having more and more electrons travelling with the laser pulse. This generates a higher current and resulting a high quasi-stationary magnetic field which in turn enhances the self-focusing and thus favours the results of Hauser et al. [27] who investigated the self-focusing of laser under classical relativistic nonlinearity. Fig. 4 shows the variation plot of beam width parameter f vs normalized propagation distance ξ with various values of δq for ScQP. The other parameters are α E 0 2 = 7 ω p /ω =0.9 and b =1. On setting δqto zero, we regain the classical case i.e. we are ignoring the quantum effects. But, Fig. 4 reveals that on increasing the values of δq (taking in to account the quantum effect), the self-focusing appears earlier and much stronger. This is because of the fact that quantum effect gives stronger beam localization which adds the self-focusing. Comparing the results with those of Patil et al. [4], wherein by considering the classical case, the parameter expressing the beam width attains its minima at ξ =0.18 and small focusing takes place. But, in our case the beam width parameter attains minima at ξ =0.0009 and hence gives rise to stronger self-focusing of laser beam. Thus, quantum effect gives a relative stronger self-focusing effect in ScQP than that in classical relativistic case. Fig. 5 shows the plot for variation of f with ξ for the intensities, I =1.3×1016 W/cm 2,I =3.9×1016 W/cm 2, I =6.5×1016 W/cm 2 and I =9.1×1016 W/cm 2. The rest of the parameters are same as taken in Fig. 3. From Fig. 5, we observe that the beam width parameter f decreases with increase in laser intensity and is minimum (corresponding to ξ =0.0009) at optimized laser intensity I =9.1×1016 W/cm 2. In other words, at higher intensities, earlier and stronger self-focusing is achieved in ScQP. Thus, we have found that the study of HchG beams is very relevant for analysis of various parameters in ScQP. It is interesting to find that the parameters like decentered parameter, intensity of the laser beam and plasma density are found to influence the self-focusing of the laser beam in a significant manner. 4 Conclusion The self-focusing of Hermite–cosh-Gaussian (HchG) laser beam in semiconductor quantum plasma (ScQP) has been studied. The differential equation governing the evolution of the laser spot size in semiconductor quantum plasma is derived. Our formulation is based on the approximation of parabolic equation under paraxial approach and incorporates the strong desirability of self-focusing effect by exploiting the beams decentred parameter. The decentred parameter plays a crucial role in deciding the nature of self-focusing of HchG beam. It is seen that additional self-focusing is observed in ScQP than classical case of reference. Further, the quantum plasma adds pinching effect to laser propagation in semiconductors as a result the self-focusing is enhanced more and more in ScQP. Again, we have found that HchG beams give freedom to source parameters like decentred parameter that changes the nature of self-focusing significantly. Thus, quantum effect plays a vital role in laser-plasma interaction and significantly adds to self-focusing in semiconductor quantum plasma. The results of present investigation may be useful in high power laser − driven fusion and laser plasma based accelerators. ", [1] S.A. Akhmanov A.P. Sukhorukov R.V. Khokhlov Sov. Phys.

Recently the improvement of communication network in the world mostly depends on fiber optic communication with appropriate signals. The intrinsic characteristics of transmitted signal through fiber relies on the concept of fiber optic code division multiple access (FOCDMA), which is based on widely used code division multiple access (CDMA)[1] technology in microwave wireless communications. It is just a code assigned to each user with less cross correlation which is simply known as spreading codes or signature sequences. Fiber optic code division multiple access (FOCDMA) is a common optical communication channel which shared among multiple users [2–5]. The bit error rate (BER) is the majority important presentation factor of any digital communications system. It is a gauge of the probability that any given bit will have been arriving in error. For example a standard greatest bit error rate (BER) for several systems is 10−9 [6–10]. This indicates that the recipient is approved to produce an utmost of 1 error in every 109 bits of information transmitted or putting it in a different way, the chance that any inward bit is in error of 10−9. The bit error rate (BER) depends chiefly on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the arriving signal which in turn is evaluated by the transmitted signal power, the decrease of the link, the link dispersion and the recipient noise [11–15]. Bit error rate (BER) measurement is not an easy process and it requires expensive and sophisticated apparatus to attain accuracy, particularly at high bit rates. However, the effects of noise and other signal degradation processes can be found qualitatively and perhaps even in a pseudo quantitative and bit error rate (BER) degradation trends which can be enthusiastically calculated due to the effects of signal dispersion and attenuation [16,17]. Though above references dealt with fiber optic code division process, this paper shows a comparative study of performance analysis for different sets of parameters. The different parameters considered are cardinality, spreading factor, number of wavelengths, temporal length and weight. The performance criterion of these code families is bit error rate (BER) due to multiple access interference (MAI) as a function of number of active users. The effect of one parameter to other is analysed by entertaining four type of codes such as generalized multi-wavelength Reed-Solomon code (GMWRSC), row-wise orthogonal pairs (RWOP), complete row-wise orthogonal pairs (CRWOP) and Multiwavelength Orthogonal Optical Code (MWOOC)[18]. The comparisons are designed in the form of tables and figures. In the tables rows are labelled with cardinality (Nmax), bit error rate (BER) due to multiple access interference (MAI), spreading factor (Sf), weight (K’), number of time chips (T) and number of wavelengths (Wl), where as each column is assigned one parameters corresponding to each of the four code families. The objective is to find optimum code family with which maximum number of users should use the spectrum with less bit error rate (BER) due to multiple access interference (MAI)[19]. As number of users increases bit error rate (BER) also increases. The code families which show less increase in bit error rate (BER) are better. For the sake of same comparison, we use generalized bit error rate (BER) form, which given by [20–23] (1) BER ' = 1 2 ∑ i = K ′ N N C i ( K' 2 2 WT ) i ( 1 − K' 2 2 WT ) N − i (2) BER ' = 1 2 ∑ i = 0 K' ( − 1 ) i K' C i ( 1 − qi K' ) N − 1 Where W is the integer number of wavelengths, T is the number of time chips, K’ is number of weights, N is number of active users q = 1 p K ′ 2 ( Nmax ) p − 1 2 ToocNmaxp 2 − 1 + p − 1 ( p K ′ 2 ( Nmax ) p − 1 ) + ( K ′ − 1 ) 2 2 ToocNmaxp 2 − 1 Nmax is the cardinality, Tooc is the temporal length. Eqs (1) and (2) are representing the bit error rate (BER) for GMWRCs and Multiwavelength Optical Orthogonal Code (MWOOC). The bit error rate (BER) due to multiple access interference (MAI) is quite similar to wavelengths of wi and wj. Since the two 1D OOCs along with wavelengths wi and wj are observed concurrently for any user, Hence the overall response for BER can be evaluated by equation 3 which as follows. an error is occurred due to interference wavelengths wi and wj are bit coinciding (T), so the bit error rate (BER) due to multiple access interference (MAI) for the two dimensional (2D) code families is (3) B E R ′ = B E R ( N w i ) × B E R ( N w j ) T Eq. (3) represents the bit error rate (BER) for row-wise orthogonal pairs (RWOP) and complete row-wise orthogonal pairs (CRWOP). Section 2 illustrates performance analysis of different code families(RWOP, CRWOP, MWOOC, GMWRC) with respect to (cardinality (Nmax), bit error rate (BER) due to multiple access interference (MAI), spreading factor (Sf), weight (K’), number of time chips (T) and number of wavelengths (Wl). In addition figures and tables have been suitably placed for proper explanation. Finally conclusions are drawn in section 3. 2 Result and discussion To get the optimized result, we have focussed to vary two crucial parameter as BER and weights (number of bits) pertaining to all code families. The efficiency each variations were studied deeply, to maximize the number of user with less BER. The detail analysis was available in 2.1 and 2.2, which explains the nobility of this work. 2.1 Analysis of code family based on equivalent bit error rate The simulation result is available in Fig. 1 , where x axis takes independent variable as number of active users, where as bit error rate are plotted in y-axis. To have better comparison we set a fixed bit error rate of 10−4. From the graph we have inferred other parameter like (Nmax), Spreading Factor (Sf), Weight (K’), Number of Wavelengths (WI) and number of time chips (T). Keeping BER range of 10−4, the inferred result suitable placed in Table 1 . We reach to a conclusion that RWOP is showing better performance as compared other code families. If we take GMWRSC alone, it is supporting very large number of active users, which is good prospective for us. By on other hand interference level is quite high, which is not welcome factor. Here K and wi posses high values, which are responsible for causing interference. If we consider RWOP, the cardinality may be less but we are achieving very low interference rate which is our goal. MWOOC is not considering for up to the mark because it has high time chip, which ultimately enhance the interference level. As CRWOP is fetching average result, we are simple reject. In the next iteration/attempt, we have started with a bit error rate of 10−7 and proceeded to examine the difference between current and previous output. Though we have chosen similar kind of approach for both the cases, but the latter case result in terms of number of users is enhanced significantly. Decrement of bit error rate may increase the no of users but in reality interference level has been given more priority and showing better performance. Here also all the results in terms of (Nmax), Spreading Factor (Sf), Weight (K’), Number of Wavelengths (WI) and number of time chips (T) with code families are reflected in Table 2 and Fig. 2 . The tabular data confirms that RWOP code again going to be powerful one compared other. 2.2 Analysis of code family based on equivalent weights In last section the importance of bit error rate was thoroughly investigated. Alike the bit error rate, another crucial parameter in terms of weight can potentially influence the result. Hence it is customary to set a fixed weight for all the families to check out the difference. By fixing K=4 other parameter are extracted and recorded in the Table 3 . According to Table 3 the value of Nmax are 55, 56, 60 and 54 for the code families (GMWRSC), (CRWOP), (RWOP) and (MWOOC) respectively. Using data from Table 3, a graph is plotted between bit error rates (BER) and active users. From the graph it is seen that the complete row-wise orthogonal pairs (CRWOP) and row-wise orthogonal pairs (RWOP) code families are of similar kind of nature with less deviation and also have least bit error rate (BER). BER of CRWOP and RWOP are almost with increase the number of active users in Fig. 3 . BER of MWOOC is more as compared to RWOP and CRWOP which exponentially increases with respect to the number of active users. But other hand highest BER is observed in GMWRC which also follow similar kind of increment with respect to the number of active users. But performance wise RWOP is efficient one in comparison to other family due to lower BER. As in all cases RWOP give better result we intentionally took another value of K=6 and proceeded and corresponding Table 4 and Fig. 4 . Finally we reach to the conclusion that RWOP is efficient one in comparison to other code families with respect to above said parameters. 3 Conclusion Different types of code family are analysed for investigating the performance of FOCDMA. It is found that parameters such as cardinality (Nmax),Bit error rate(BER),Spreading Factor(Sf),Weight(K’), number of time chips(T) and Number of Wavelengths(WI) play vital role for the above analysis. In conclusion, simulation result revealed that row-wise orthogonal pairs (RWOP) code family gives high performance than others. For the bit error rate of 10−4 and 10−7, GMWRSC families present better performance up to 170 numbers of users. But when we include weights along with bit error rate RWOP turned out to be the best one. "," [1] A. Stok E.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.101,Improve atmospheric visibility accuracy with the divergence angle correction of the probe beam,"Abstract The probe beam is the important part of the visibility meter. And the divergence angle size of the probe beam affects the accuracy of visibility. In the paper, the relation between the divergence angle and the visibility relative error was established by the experiment model. The aerosol generator produced different concentration atmosphere, which was measured as atmospheric sample under the different visibility. The relationship between the divergence angle of the probe beam and the different atmospheric samples was established. The detection values and correction function were obtained at different divergence angles under various atmospheric samples. The experimental result shows that the divergence angle of the probe beam affects the visibility measurement. And the larger the divergence angle is, the greater the measurement error is. The measurement of the divergence angle must be corrected. Using the measurement method with the divergence angle correction, under the low visibility conditions, the relative error of the visibility is reduced from 25% to 10% at least, in the divergence angle range of 25mrad. When the allowable error is 5%, the allowable value of the divergence angle is increased by one time.",Feb-18," Keywords Divergence angle Atmosphere visibility Correction Optical power 1 Introduction According to the definition, visibility could be presented by the meteorological optical visual range. Meteorological optical visual range refers to the distance that the luminous flux weakens to 5% of initial value through the atmosphere, and the flux comes from the parallel beam of incandescent light which color temperature is 2700K [1]. In the definition, there is explicit requirement that the probe beam should be parallel. For transmissive visibility meter, when the probe beam is parallel, the transmittance T could be calculated that T = I I 0 , in the detection channel [2]. And the visibility R ∝ 1 I n T . The actual beam is not strict parallel in the measurement channel due to scattering, especially multiple scattering effects [3–5]. The visibility basic equation [6], Lambert-Beer law I = I 0 e −βL , has ignored multiple scattering effects. β is extinction coefficient, and Lis distance of measurement channel. When βL gets to a certain degree, multiple scattering effects cannot be ignored[7], which reduces the accuracy of Lambert-Beer law. Deepak and Zardecki had studied the relationship between the multiple scattering correction and the field of view in detail[8]. For scattering visibility meter, the receiving value is also affected by the emission angle of probe beam and the receiving field angle of detector. Xiao S et al. [9] used the combination of lens and fiber to constrain the viewing angle. The measurement value was near double compared to the unconstrained. However, due to the presence of the probe beam divergence angle [10–16], the detector’s sampling volume changes, which will cause the detection value to change. At the same time, during the installation and movement of the visibility meter, the divergence angle of the light source is likely to change. It will affect the detection value [17,18]. In order to study the influence of divergence angle on visibility, we took the different concentration aerosol as the atmospheric sample, and measured them. The visibility measurement model with different divergence angle was established. The accuracy of visibility measurement was improved by correcting the divergence angle. 2 Principle In the transmission visibility measuring device [19,20], the change of the position and the size of the divergence angle will cause the collimation error of the receiver [21,22]. When the divergence angle is too large, the spot cannot fall in the receiving plane completely. It will make the measurement error. When the collimation system corrects the collimation error in real time and the receiver has the lens, the spot can be ensured to fall in the center of the detector, and the collimation error is the smallest. From the aspect of the detector receiving light intensity and particle scattering, the scattering particles increases with a certain divergence angle. The secondary scattering and multiple scattering of the particles cause the widening of the brightness direction. Especially in the case of low visibility, multiple scattering cannot be ignored and its effect is significant. The impact on the detector receiving value also tends to be significant [2,3]. In the transmission visibility measurement device as shown in Fig. 1 , the probe beam divergence angle affects the receiver to determine the volume of the sample directly. At the same time, the detection value is also affected by wavelength, medium particle size, density, optical thickness and other factors. For a random medium volume V, in the direction of e S , a certain point r, its radiation brightness can be divided into two parts. One part is the brightness of the incident radiation in the direction, known as the reduction brightness. The other part is the contribution of other scatters in the direction of e S , known as the diffuse brightness. For the transmission visibility measurement device, the radiance received by the detector is the sum of the average reduced brightness and the average diffuse brightness in the whole range of the solid angle. They are (1) U r i ( r ) = 1 4 π ∫ 4 π L i ( r 0 , e S ) e − τ ( r ) d ω (2) U d ( r ) = 1 4 π ∫ V [ γ ∫ 4 π p ( e S , e S ′ ) L i ( r 1 , e S ′ ) d ω ′ + ε ( r 1 , e S ′ ) ] exp [ − τ ( r ) + τ ( r 1 ) ] | r − r 1 | 2 d V 1 The size of the probe beam divergence angle changes the volume of the medium V, which affects the average diffuse brightness directly, and also affects the detector's receiving value. However, when using Lambert-Beer law to calculate the visibility (3) R = L ln ε ln T = L ln ε ln I I 0 Where Llnε is the constant, I 0 is emitting light intensity, Iis receiving light intensity. I reflects the reduced brightness of the light source only. This needs to be measured at a very narrow angle in the direction of light advance [4,5]. When the probe beam has a certain divergence angle, the larger the angle, or the larger the size of particles in the detection channel, the greater the proportion of the diffuse brightness received by the receiver. Thus, it is necessary to correct the detector receiving value by the relationship between the divergence angle and the radiation brightness when calculate the visibility with Lambert-Beer's law. For transmissive measurement, the optical power can be analyzed by the relationship between the divergence angle of probe beam and the receiving value of the optical power. It is expressed as, (4) I t ′ = I t f ( θ ) where I t ′ is the theoretical value，I t is the measured value. The visibility is (5) R = L ln ε ln T = L ln ε ln I t ′ I 0 = L ln ε ln I t f ( θ ) I 0 = L ln ε ln U t f ( θ ) U 0 For the scattering visibility measurement, in the scattering direction, the integral volume is also affected by the divergence angle. The detector receiving value is also expressed as I t ′= I t f(θ). The visibility is (6) R = L ln ε K ⋅ ln I t f ( θ ) I 0 = L ln ε K ⋅ ln U t f ( θ ) U 0 where K is the constant. The Eq. (5) and (6) show that the visibility could be affected by the divergence angle of the probe beam directly. The equation (3) should be corrected with θ. 3 Experimental setup The experimental structure is designed. It is shown in Fig. 2 . The aerosol generator model is TDA-4B. There are the PAO oil, six nozzles and three control valves in the TDA −4B. The aerosol output flow can been controlled by adjusting the three control valves. The gas with the single particle is generated. The gas would be taken as the sample under the different visibility after the gas moves stably in the container. High pressure pure argon’s pressure was 13Mpa. It was pressed into the aerosol generator, adjusted by the control valve, and then went into the cylindrical closed container. The light source was adjusted to the parallel beam by the collimator lens. The parallel beam was divided into two groups by the beam splitter. One went through the aerosol directly. The other became the detection beam with a certain divergence angle under the convex lens adjustment. The size of the divergence angle was measured by the divergence angle measurement device. The two beams were received by the detectors and measured the optical power. A standard sample with an extinction coefficient of 0.003 m-1(μ =0.003m−1) was produced by the aerosol generator. The sample concentration can be increased by adjusting the control valves. The extinction coefficient also increased to 2μ, 3μ……9μ. Then, the standard aerosol samples were formed with the concentration from 1 time to 109 times. Took the laser diode as the detection beam light source, the divergence angle changed within 40 mrad. The adjusting effect of the convex lens in Fig. 2 is tested by the divergence angle measurement device [13]. 15 probe beams with a certain divergence angle were obtained, as shown in Table 1 . Adjusted the aerosol concentration at different beam divergence angles, or adjusted the beam divergence angle at each aerosol concentration in a state where the detector was always able to receive a complete spot. Multiple sets of optical power detection signals can be obtained 4 Experiment analysis 4.1 Divergence angle correction The probe beam was transmitted into the standard extinction coefficient sample. The control valves of the aerosol generator were adjusted to increase the sample concentration. In each concentration sample, the divergence angle of the probe beam was adjusted. And as the divergence angle changed step by step, the received optical power also changed, as shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3, the sample concentration is from 1 to 9 times. When the sample concentration is low, the optical power is strong, the sample concentration is high, the optical power is weakened. When the concentration is above 5 times, the optical power is weak and the optical power values are close. As the divergence angle increases, the optical power decreases. The decrease in the low concentration is lower than the high concentration slightly. When the divergence angle is small, at each concentration, the optical power decrease is 5mw. With the divergence angle increasing, the optical power decrease expands to 7mw slightly. Each optical power value is normalized in Fig. 4 . By comparison, the polynomial g(θ)= p 1 θ 2 + p 2 θ + p 3is chosen as the fitting function. C1∼C9 are used to express the 1∼9 times concentration. After the polynomial fitting, the relation between the divergence angle and the optical power is shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5, when the aerosol concentration is 1∼5 times, with the divergence angle increasing, the optical power decreases. The greater the divergence angle, the greater the optical power decreases. When the concentration is above 6 times, with the divergence angle increasing, the optical power decreases significantly. When the divergence angle is within 10mrad, the change of optical power is not significant at each concentration. At the same time, the parameters of the fitting curve are very close, and the average fitting function is obtained (7) g ( θ ) = p ¯ 1 θ 2 + p ¯ 2 θ + p ¯ 3 The coefficients p ¯ 1 、 p ¯ 2 、 p ¯ 3 are the divergence angle correction parameters. The parallel beam transmittance is expressed asT //, then (8) T / / = U t / / U 0 = U t g ( θ ) ⋅ U 0 By the Lambert-Beer's law I = I 0 e −βL , the extinction coefficient is (9) β = - ln T / / L = − ln U t g ( θ ) ⋅ U 0 L The visibility is (10) R = − ln ε β = L ln ε ln U t g ( θ ) ⋅ U 0 Contrast Eq. (5), there is g ( θ ) = 1 f ( θ ) . 4.2 Uncorrected result If the divergence angle do not be corrected, then (11) R = L ln ε ln T = L ln ε ln U t U 0 The visibility relative error is (12) Δ R R = ln T / / ( 1 ln T / / − 1 ln ( T / / ⋅ g ( θ ) ) The fitting result is shown in Fig. 6 . The greater the aerosol concentration, the greater the relative error of the visibility. When the relative error is 5%, the maximum allowable is 7∼12mrad at different aerosol concentrations. In order to ensure the effective visibility in different environments, the maximum value is 7mrad. When the relative error is 10%, the maximum allowable is 8∼15mrad at different aerosol concentrations. In order to ensure the effective visibility, the maximum value is 8mrad. And the divergence angle of the emission beam of the visibility instrument is often greater than the maximum allowable value, which will make the relative error of the visibility measurement greater. 4.3 Corrected result Using the aerosol as the measured atmospheric sample, when the real-time visibility was measured, the Eq.10 was used and the divergence angle was used to correct the result. After the calculation, the visibility relative error is (13) Δ R R = ln T / / ( 1 ln T / / − 1 ln ( U t U 0 ⋅ g ( θ ) ) ) It compared with the result that didn’t consider the divergence angle. The result was shown in Fig. 7 . There are two sets of curves in Fig. 7. The upper group is the relative error of the visibility at different divergence angles calculated from the measured values directly. The lower group is the relative error of the visibility obtained by adding the divergence angle correction. The relative error of the lower set of curves is smaller than the upper set of curves significantly. The upper set of curves don’t join the divergence angle correction, and the curve flat interval is 0–10mrad. When the divergence angle is more than 10mrad, the relative error is increased significantly. At 25mrad divergence angle, 9 times the concentration of aerosol, the relative error is the highest, reaching 60%, that is, the measurement error of low visibility value is very big. When the aerosol concentration decreases gradually, that is, the visibility increases gradually, the measurement error is reduced slightly. But the value is still high. At 7–8 times the concentration, the relative error is 48%. At 6 times concentration, the relative error is about 35%. At 1–5 times the concentration, the relative error is about 30%. In the lower set of curves, which were corrected with the divergence angle, the overall value of the relative error of the visibility is small relatively, and the curves overlap each other. It indicates that the relative error is close numerically. In the range of the divergence angle, the correction effect is consistent. When divergence angle is within 25mrad, the visibility of the relative error are relatively flat. At 25mrad, the error of the concentration of 1 times and 5 times is about 10%, and the error of other concentration is not more than 5%. However, it is 25%∼60% without divergence angle correction. At least, under the low visibility conditions, the relative error can be reduced to 40%. When the divergence angle is greater than 25mrad, the relative error increases. For the lower set of curves in Fig. 7, when the relative error is taken as 5%, under different aerosol concentration that is different atmospheric visibility, the transmitter divergence angle of the maximum allowable is 12mrad. For the upper set of curves, the maximum allowable angle is 7mrad. The lower value is nearly doubled from the upper value. When the relative error is taken as 10%, under different aerosol concentration, the transmitter divergence angle of the maximum allowable is 28mrad for the lower set of curves. For the upper set of curves, the maximum allowable angle is 8∼9mrad. The lower value increases by 2 times than the upper value. 5 Conclusion In this paper, the influence of atmospheric scattering on the detection beam and the influence of the divergence angle of the beam on the visibility measurement are discussed. Atmospheric samples with different concentrations are generated by the aerosol generator. The relationship between the probe beam divergence angle and the different atmospheric samples is established. Under various samples, the correction function of the detection value is obtained. The function takes the divergence angle as the parameter. The experimental results show that the divergence angle of the probe beam has the influence on the visibility measurement. The larger the divergence angle is, the greater the uncertainty of the visibility measurement. The divergence angle must be corrected. Using the measurement method with the divergence angle correction, the relative error of the visibility measurement can be reduced from 25% to 10% at least, under the low visibility conditions and the 25mrad divergence angle.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.092,Theoretical analysis and experiments of pulsed laser circular-viewing system,"Abstract To realize detection of moving vehicles, the pulsed laser circular-viewing system is proposed. The principle of system is described. The scanning detection model of laser circular-viewing system is established based on best matching principle. The maximum range and minimum motor speed are deduced. Laser ranging system and azimuth detection system are designed. The system is fabricated to test.

The system possesses overload capacity at a certain degree.",Feb-18," Keywords Pulse laser Circular-viewing detection Two-dimensional scan Laser ranging 1 Introduction Pulse laser circumferential detection system is a kind of 2D laser radar, which has been widely used in civil and military applications, such as outdoor unmanned navigation, indoor laser navigation, UAV barrier and laser imaging [1–6]. In autonomous navigation, it is critical for mobile robot to realize SLAM technology. Compared with other distance sensor, the laser radar can both consider the precision and speed requirements. Therefore, it can effectively improve the state estimation and moving target recognition, which becomes gradually a significant component to realize the robot's autonomous navigation. Laser pulse circumferential detection system is the single emission and received system for synchronous scanning detection. Laser divergence angle is small, short pulse duration, energy concentration with large instantaneous power. It can ensure the effective detection range [7]. However, in laser navigation, the laser pulse frequency and the scanning speed of the motor will directly affect the correct acquisition of the moving target. Gan [8–10] established target acquisition model and analyze target capture situation. The matching relation between the pulse frequency and scanning speed of motor and the capture rate were obtained. However, the model will appear in the case of leak scanning, which could not guarantee the effective detection of moving targets. Therefore, the best matching model should be established according to the moving target in the actual laser navigation. In laser navigation, not only the pulse frequency and the scanning speed of the motor affect the detection performance, but also the distance measurement accuracy will affect the whole map. Aiming at the problem of pulse laser ranging, KOU studied the influence of atmospheric turbulence on ranging accuracy [7]. ZHAO derived the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the ranging accuracy [11,12]. M.S. Oh reduced the walk error to improve the ranging accuracy [13]. In this paper, the principle of pulsed laser circular-viewing system is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, the scanning detection model is established based on best matching principle, the maximum range and minimum motor speed are deduced. In Section 4, laser ranging system and azimuth detection system are designed according to deduced parameters. Finally, the experiments of laser emission system, laser ranging and anti overloads are verified the system performance. 2 Principle of laser circular-viewing detection system Laser circular-viewing system working principle: The control system produce periodic pulse signal to trigger driving power. The driving power generates narrow pulse current to drive LD. The laser beam is converted into parallel light through the collimating lens. The drive control system controls the motor, and the motor speed and azimuth information are acquired in real time through the encoder. The laser beam is incident on a flat mirror fixed on the motor. With the rotation of the motor, the measured object is irradiated by laser beam. Some scattered light from the reflection mirror incident on laser focusing lens. The light generates photon once into photoelectric detector. Then, the echo signal is obtained by photoelectric amplifier module. After time discrimination system, laser ranging is realized. The working principle of the pulse laser circumferential detection system is shown in Fig. 1 . 3 Scanning detection model The laser circumferential scanning detection model is drawn in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2(b), if the divergence of laser through a collimating lens output angle is bigger, repetition point more likely appears. The dense scanning model will affect the imaging quality. As shown in Fig. 2(c), if the laser divergence through the collimating lens output angle is smaller, the leakage point phenomenon more likely occurs. Therefore, it is easy to leak the point with sparse scanning model in the actual detection target. The best scan detection model is shown in Fig. 2(a). We have the optimum matching model when the laser divergence angle after the collimated lens is the same as the encoder resolution. Therefore, the matching of motor speed, encoder resolution, and laser emission frequency and laser divergence angle is vital. According to the scanning matching model, the equation is available. (1) 2 π φ / 1000 = δ (2) 1 n / 60 = 2 π φ / 1000 1 f Where, n(r/min) is the motor speed, f(kHz) is pulse laser emission frequency，φ(mrad) is laser divergence angle, and δ is the encoder resolution. The laser system detects vehicle after acquiring the matched scanning model. vr is relative velocity. Based the principle of scanning vehicle at least twice, the relationship between motor speed and the relative velocity could be calculated after motion estimation. (3) d 1 = x 1 sin ( π - α ) The distance of moving target is: (4) Δ x = R max 2 − d 1 2 + l Where R max is maximum detection range, l is target length. The motor speed is: (5) 1 n / 60 ≤ Δ x v r The motor speed can be calculated by substituting Eqs. (3) and (4) into Eq. (5): (6) n ≥ 60 v r R max 2 − x 1 2 sin 2 α + l Based on the properties of inequality, the minimum motor speed is (7) n min = 60 v r l The laser ranging equation can be used to estimate the maximum detection range and its influence factors, and the lateral area of target is much larger than laser facula area. Therefore, we can obtain the received power by changing equation form: (8) P R = ρ P k T e T r T f D 2 cos β 4 R 2 × e − 2 σ R Where ρ is the reflectivity of target, Pk is the peak power, Te is optical transmittance for emission optical system, Tr is transmittance for focusing lens, Tf is transmittance of narrowband filter, β is the angle between the target reflection surface normal to the optical axis, D is the optical system aperture diameter of the receiver, R is the detection range, σ is atmospheric extinction coefficient. According to the Eq. (7), we can obtain the maximum detection range is: (9) R max = ρ P k T e T r T f D 2 cos β 4 P R × e − 2 σ R The basic parameters of simulation are as follows: ρ=0.1, PR=100nW, Te =0.8, Tr =0.8, Tf =0.8, β=0, D =15mm, Pk=20W, vr=60km/h, l =2m.We can obtain the Required parameters: Rmax = 24m, nmin = 500 r/min. 4 The system design 4.1 The design of laser system The SPLPL90-3 is used in the system, whose wavelength is 905nm. The pulse width is adjustable, and the supply voltage is 20V. The maximum peak power reaches 70W. Photoelectric detector uses APD avalanche photodiode, which type is AD500-9 TO52S1. Its rise time is 0.55ns. When the amplify gain is 100, 905nm wavelength response of APD is 60A/W. APD comes with filter. The external amplification circuit uses OPA657 transimpedance amplifier to carry out two stage amplification, and the gain bandwidth product of the OPA657 is 1.6GHz, and the amplification capability can be effectively improved under the condition that the received bandwidth is guaranteed. In optical system design respect, the optical collimation system and the optical received system don’t adopt the multistage optical system in general. The single stage single optical lens is used. Compared with the spherical optical system, aspheric optical system has great advantages of improving the relative aperture ratio of the system, expanding the viewing angle, improving the beam quality, miniaturizing lens shape, and reducing system weight. Based on transmitting and receiving optical isolation in physical structure, the laser collimation lens and laser focusing lens were designed employing aspheric technology in the laser circular-viewing system. Two lenses are coated to improve the transmittance of laser beam. The system circuit is mainly composed of laser ranging circuit, azimuth calculation circuit and power circuit. The threshold method in laser ranging circuit is utilized to realize the time discrimination of the APD received laser echo signal. Combining C8051F310 and TDC-GP21, the laser flight time is calculated to estimate range. C8051F310 is LQFP package, small size, and low power consumption. TDC-GP21 possesses small size and high accuracy with time resolution of 22ps. Both of them meet the requirements of the circuit system miniaturization design. Azimuth angle is achieved by azimuth calculation circuit combining with motor encoder, which is mainly realized by single chip microcomputer. The power circuit is composed of low voltage boost circuit and high voltage boost circuit. The low voltage boost circuit is designed with the boost chip as the core. However, the high voltage boost circuit is constructed by discrete components, which is realized by PFM modulation using discontinuous inductor mode. 4.2 The design of azimuth detection system The system adopts stepping motor with closed-loop control. The high precision optical incremental encoder is installed in the traditional two-phase stepper motor on rear axle. The encoder has real-time characteristics of rotor position, driver can real-time monitor the motor shaft position to compensate the displacement error, which ensures accurate positioning. When the load changes suddenly, the traditional open-loop stepper motor without encoder feedback will appear lost step. The principle of encoder is shown in Fig. 3 . The DSP control circuit acquires the encoder signal. As signal of Z phase is measured, the output signal is recorded as 0°. When signal of B phase is measured, DSP control circuit counts 1. Then we can convert the count value to angular position information. The minimum speed of the motor is 500r/min. In order to guarantee the stable encoder information, the stability control of the motor must be guaranteed, Then, PI regulation control, the speed and current double closed loop control, is adopted. The mathematical model of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 4 : 5 Experiments 5.1 Experiments of laser emission system In the design processing of laser driving circuit, the IXDD409 MOSFET driver is used with 1nF charging capacitor. The power supply voltage is 200V, and test resistances were 0Ω, 1Ω, 2.5Ω and 5Ω. SPLPL90-3 voltage waves are in Fig. 5 . With the increase of resistance of laser driving circuit, the current value is reduced, the peak current are 30A, 25A, 10A and 8A. The pulse width of test current waveform is also reduced, pulse width are 6.4ns, 8.6ns, 14.82ns, 16ns. Due to the adoption of IXDD409 MOSFET driver, the current of MOSFET tube is large, and the rising edge time is short. The rising edges are 4ns, 5ns, 10ns and 12ns respectively. The designed circuit can realize the control function of pulse width, power and waveform. 5.2 Laser ranging experiments Measurement experiment of 10m at different angles was done. The experimental results statistics is shown in Fig. 6 . After removing the outliers, the ranging results are lower than 10m. With the increase of tilt angle, the average distance measurement increases. In order to quantify the distance measurement results, the mean and standard deviations of different tilt angles are calculated, and the results are shown in Table 1 . It can be seen from the table that the standard deviation of ranging is lower than 0.04m. The error of single range measurement is not only affected by time interval, but also affected by many factors, such as comparator time jitter and noise. Meanwhile, the system error is corrected. The distance measurement results from different angles show that the ranging result is between 9.200m and 9.510m. 5.3 Anti overloads experiments In the running process of the system, system usually need to bear huge overload, due to the and structure precision and material particularity of laser optical system and rotary scanning system, the focal distance and coaxiality may change after bearing high overload. The accuracy and reliability of the laser circumferential detection are seriously affected. In order to improve high overload capacity of optical module, integrated design method of mechanical structure is applied. The polycarbonate is adapted to fabrication of optical lens. The commonly used cushion gasket materials are tetrafluoroethylene, rubber, industrial felt and aluminum, and their wave impedance values are small. The tetrafluoroethylene cushion gasket is used to reduce the overload of the impact on the laser transmitting and receiving optical system and the whole anti plane mirror. The anti overloads ability of the motor in the rotating scanning module is reduced by the encapsulation technology. The rotating scanning module is integrally arranged in the motor seat, and the motor seat is encapsulated from the outside. The fixture structure is shown in Fig. 7 . The acceleration sensor is connected by thread on the fixture. The fixture is assembled on the principle prototype of laser circular-viewing detection system. The acceleration value of the acceleration sensor is recorded with hammer tests and air cannon experiments. The measured acceleration curves are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 . From Fig. 8, the acceleration peak reaches about 5000g and the pulse width is about 500us. As can be seen from Fig. 9, the acceleration peak reaches 34000g, and the pulse width is about 300us. After the anti high overload test of the optical system, the mechanical structure of the prototype has not been damaged, the motor can still operate normally, and the principle prototype can still carry out the target detection experiment. 6 Conclusions To realize detection of moving vehicles, the pulsed laser circular-viewing system is described. The scanning detection model of laser circular-viewing system is established based on best matching principle. Laser ranging system and azimuth detection system are designed and fabricated to test. The emission system is adjustable. It provides a favorable guarantee for laser navigation. "," [1] W.D. Chen Y.L. Liu Q.G. Zhu Y.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.035,Optical solitons in monomode fibers with higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation,"Abstract The article studies the dynamics of optical single and combined solitons in monomode optical fibers which are described by higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation. As a result, the bright, dark and singular optical 1-solitons and dark-singular, combo singular optical solitons have been extracted. The beauty of this research work is, one can obtain single and combined optical solitons using five parameters in a single integration technique. Moreover, the graphical representations are also depicted.",Feb-18," Keywords Higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation Optical solitons Monomode fibers Integrability 1 Introduction In dispersive medium, the propagation of nonlinear waves is of great interest in the recent era of contemporary science and technology. The nonlinear transformation of dielectric of the fiber termed as the Kerr effect, is applied to neutralize the dispersion effect, in this state the optical pulse form a steady nonlinear pulse termed as optical soliton. The bit rate of transmission is limited by the dispersion of the fiber material. The fiber loss is the only factor that contributes to the drop of the pulse quality by expansion in the pulse width which are caused by microdeformations such as microbends of the fiber axis and random fluctuations of the fiber core diameter, for details see [1–6]. In last some decades, both mathematician and physicist have made much efforts in finding the analytic solutions to a number of nonlinear models. As a result, many powerful techniques are introduced to deal with problems involving nonlinear complex phenomena of nature, which play a vital role in physical sciences, such as inverse scattering scheme [7], B a ¨ cklund transform method [8], homogeneous balance scheme [9], Painlev e ´ expansion [10], sine-cosine method, Darboux transformation, Lie group analysis, mapping method and extended mapping method [11,12], Exp-function method [13], rational expansion method [14], Adomian decomposition method [15,16], homotopy perturbation method [17], homotopy analysis method [18], differential transform method, reduced differential method, tanh-coth method [20–22], simplified Hirota's method, extended homoclinic test approach [19], transformed rational function method [21], Hirota's bilinear method [23], Bernoulli's equation approach [26], semi-inverse variational principle [27], ansatz scheme [28], complex envelope function ansatz method [29], generalized Kudryashov method [30] and many more. In the literature, a variety of suitable methods are adopted to investigate the behavior of the nonlinear equations. The study about solutions, structures, interaction and further properties of soliton abstracts is given much more attention in the recent past. A strong relation is found among the general elliptic equation and most of the existing sub-equations like the Riccati equation, auxiliary equation [31], first kind elliptic equation, and generalized Riccati equation [32], but also helps us to find more and new exact solutions to NPDEs. As a result, some new and more general exact traveling wave solutions are obtained, see also [33–38]. The extended Fan Sub-equation method is successfully applied to construct travelling wave solutions of higher order nonlinear Schrödinger (HNLS) equation illustrating the linear and the nonlinear dispersion as well as dissipation effects in monomode fibers [4]. The HNLS model reduces to the integrable nonlinear Schrödinger equation by eliminating the last three expressions. Mathematica 10.4 is used to carried out simulations and contour plot have been applied to visualize the behavior of optical waves. The governing systems are read as: (1) ∂ Φ ∂ z = i ς 1 ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + ς 2 | Φ | 2 Φ + ς 3 ∂ 3 Φ ∂ t 3 + ς 4 ∂ ∂ t | Φ | 2 Φ + ς 5 Φ ∂ ∂ t | Φ | 2 where the coefficients ς j for j =1, 2, 3, 4, 5; are real constants. This article has been devised as follows: in Section 2, the solutions to the HNLS equation is presented while in Section 3, the physical behaviour of the solutions is discussed. In last Section 4, the conclusions have been drawn. 2 Solitons for HNLS equation In order to extract optical solitons, one may have the following starting hypothesis, the wave profile is split into amplitude and phase components, respectively, as (2) Φ ( z , t ) = e i ψ Ω ( ξ ) , where ξ = β ( ν t + z ) , The Ω(ξ) is the amplitude components of the wave profiles, while the phase factor is given by (3) ψ = k z + ω t + θ , where k, ω and θ represent the frequency of the solitons, the wave number and the phase constant respectively.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.057,Synthesis and luminescence properties of Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+—A novel blue-emitting bromapatite phosphor for near-ultraviolet-pumped white light-emitting diodes,"Abstract A series of novel Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ (x =0.01–0.10) blue phosphors were synthesized via the conventional solid state reaction and their luminescence properties were reported. The Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors could be excited efficiently in the wavelength range of 320–440nm and displayed an intense asymmetric blue emission band around 458nm under 365nm excitation. The concentration quenching of Eu2+ in the Ca5(PO4)3Br host was investigated in detail. The optimum doping concentration of Eu2+ was determined to be 0.07 and the energy transfer mechanism was certified to be the dipole–dipole interaction. Moreover, the CIE chromaticity coordinates for the composition-optimized Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ were located in the blue region at (x =0.1450, y =0.0840), whose color purity was close to that of the commercial blue phosphor BaMgAl10O17: Eu2+. All these results gave an indication that Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors could serve as a promising blue-emitting candidate for near-UV-pumped white light-emitting diodes.",Feb-18," Keywords Phosphors Luminescence Ca5-x(PO4)3Br: xEu2+ White LEDs 1 Introduction Compared with the conventional fluorescent and incandescent lamps, solid state lighting based on white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) shows superior properties such as the low energy consumption, high efficiency, and environmental friendliness [1–3]. White LEDs can be successfully fabricated by combining a yellow-emitting phosphor (Y1-a Gd a )3(Al1-b Ga b )5O12: Ce3+ (YAG: Ce3+) with a blue light gallium nitride (GaN) LED chip. However, due to the limitation of red spectral power distribution, the resulting cool and glare white light restricts the application of general illumination [4–6]. Alternatively, the white light can be generated to couple tricolor phosphors [BaMgAl10O17: Eu2+ (BAM: Eu2+) for blue, ZnS: (Cu+, Al3+) for green, and Sr2Si5N8: Eu2+ for red] with near-ultraviolet (near-UV, 360–400nm) light chips in order to obtain warm-white LEDs with adequate correlated color temperature (CCT <4000K) and sufficient color rendering indexes (CRI >80) [7]. Unfortunately, the commercial blue phosphor BAM: Eu2+ is known to be unsatisfactory for the rigorous synthesis condition (its synthetic temperature is 1623K) as well as the loss of radiation efficiency and color during thermal treatment, which inspirits us to explore desirable blue-emitting phosphors to meet the requirement for near-UV-pumped white LEDs [8]. Attributing to the 4f-5d electric-dipole allowed transitions, the luminescence of the bivalent europium (Eu2+) ion usually covers wide electro-magnetic range from the ultraviolet to the red region, depending on the different host matrices. Thus, the emission color can be tailored by the choice of the host matrix [9]. Thereinto, apatites with alkline-earth metal ions whose radii are comparable to that of Eu2+ ions are considered as potential matrices owing to their low synthesis temperature, high luminous efficiency and good stability [10]. For instance, Eu2+-doped Sr5(PO4)3Cl [11], Ba5(PO4)3Cl [12], and Ba2Y3(SiO4)3F [13] phosphors have been reported to be efficient luminescence materials for LEDs. In 1974, the calcium bromapatite Ca5(PO4)3Br was successfully prepared by Dykes [14]. Afterwards, Elliott et al. further pointed out it is a typical hexagonal apatite structure with lattice constants a =9.761(1)Å, c =6.739(1)Å, V =556.06 Å3, Z =2 [15]. In 2016, the luminescence properties of M5(PO4)3X: Eu2+ (M=Ca, Sr, Ba; X=F, Cl, Br) are discussed systematically by Donghyeon Kim et al. [16]. However, in that paper, no detailed research, such as the relationship between Eu2+ emission peaks and its occupied sites, and the concentration quenching as well as the energy transfer process, has been done to the Eu2+-doped Ca5(PO4)3Br phosphors. Therefore, in this study, the luminescence characteristics of Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors have been investigated detailedly. Moreover, the crystallographic site-occupations of Eu2+ ions were inferred to further understand the luminescence mechanism and energy transfer process from Eu(1)2+ to Eu(2)2+. As shown in this paper, Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors are expected to be the possible blue-emitting luminescent materials for near-UV white LEDs. 2 Experimental A series of Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ (x =0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10) samples were prepared by the solid state reaction method using CaO (analytical reagent, A.R.), NH4H2PO4 (A.R.), CaBr2·2H2O (A.R.), Eu2O3 (99.99%) as the raw materials. The required stoichiometric amounts of these reagents were weighed and thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar. Then the homogeneous mixtures were sintered at 500°C for 2h and subsequently sintered at 800°C for 6h in CO reducing atmosphere. After cooling to ambient temperature, the samples were ground again to give the final phosphors. The crystallization process of the complex precursor was examined by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA, SDT-600), using a sample weight of about 5.52mg and a heating rate of 10°C/min in air atmosphere. The scanning electron morphology (SEM) of the phosphor particles was examined using a field-emission electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM450). The phase structure of the prepared powder samples was characterized using a X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy (XRD, D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15405nm) at 40kV, 30mA, and a scan speed of 12.0° (2θ)/min from 10° to 70°. Diffuse reflection spectra of as-synthesized phosphors were measured on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (U-3900H, Hitachi) attached to an integral sphere. BaSO4 was used as a reference standard. The photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi) with a 150W xenon lamp under a working voltage of 400V. The fluorescence lifetime were determined on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon fluorolog (FL3-22) by monitoring the given emission from the samples under the 370nm pulsed laser excitation. 3 Results and discussion To understand the pyrolysis behavior and crystallization process, the TG-DTA profile of Ca5(PO4)3Br precursor is displayed in Fig. 1 a. When the temperature is raised at a rate of 10°C/min from 20°C to 830°C, a total weight loss of nearly 36% and four endothermic peaks (at 113°C, 200°C, 386°C and 515°C) are given in TG-DTA curve. Accordingly, the pyrolysis and crystallization process of the precursor can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage, corresponding to a mass loss of 13.92% starting from 20°C to 200°C shown in the TG curve which is evidenced by two strong endothermic peaks around 113°C and 200°C in the DTA curve, originates the beginning of dehydration of CaBr2·2H2O and decomposition of NH4H2PO4. The second stage shows a mass loss of 21.23% from 200°C to 675°C, which is corresponding to two relatively weak endothermic peaks around 386°C and 515°C. In this stage, the mass loss is attributed to the process of continuous dehydration of CaBr2·2H2O and decomposition of NH4H2PO4. The endothermic peak around 386°C is assigned to the phase formation such as calcium pyrohosphate Ca2P2O7 and calcium phosphate-tribasic Ca3(PO4)2, which has been proved by our testified XRD pattern in Fig. 1b. Another endothermic peak around 515°C should correspond to the beginning of the new Ca5(PO4)3Br phase formation, which has also been confirmed by XRD characterization in Fig. 1c. In the third stage, the weight remains invariable as the temperature over 675°C in the TG curve, indicating that the processes of precursor decomposition and reaction have been finished. Therefore, the cystallization of the Ca5(PO4)3Br precursor entirely completes at 675°C. The XRD patterns of the representative Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ (x =0.01, 0.10) samples, together with the JCPDS card for Ca5(PO4)3Br (no. 74-0672), are presented in Fig. 2 . It is observed that all the diffraction peaks of the samples are in good agreement with those of the Ca5(PO4)3Br host. Besides, the same results are also found in Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ (x =0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09) samples, indicating that the doping of Eu2+ ions between 0.01 and 0.10 does not induce any remarkable structure changes of the pure Ca5(PO4)3Br. As Fig. 3 shows, the bromapatite Ca5(PO4)3Br belongs to the hexagonal crystal structure with space group P 63/m. The structure is composed of six PO4 groups surrounded by ten Ca atoms with two Br ions. The ten Ca atoms are arranged on two non-equivalent sites Ca1 and Ca2. Each Ca1 cation with six coordination numbers is surrounded by PO4 groups only, while each Ca2 cation with seven coordination numbers is located at the periphery of c-axis-oriented tunnels that also accommodate Br anions in a central position. On the basis of the effective ionic radii of cations with different coordination numbers, the Eu2+ ions are expected to substitute Ca2+ ions in the Ca5(PO4)3Br host since the radii of Eu2+ (r =1.17Å for CN=6 and r =1.20Å for CN=7) are similar to those of Ca2+ (r =1.00Å for CN=6 and r =1.06Å for CN=7) [17]. Furthermore, the morphology of the Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ phosphor was studied using imaging techniques such as SEM. As shown in Fig. 4 , the SEM image of the phosphor reflects the inherent nature of the adopted solid state method. The particles are aggregated and show the irregular shapes with less than 7μm size. It is inferred that the phosphor is polycrystalline that consists of many single crystallite units. The diffuse reflection spectra of the Ca5(PO4)3Br host and Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ phosphor are illustrated in Fig. 5 . For the undoped sample, the onset of the diffuse reflection curve is around 310nm and it rapidly increases until up to 450nm, which results from the valence-to-conduction band transitions of the Ca5(PO4)3Br host lattice [18]. For the Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ sample, however, a strong and broad absorption band can be seen from the reflection spectrum. Due to the absence of such a band in undoped Ca5(PO4)3Br, the very broad absorption band from 310 to 450nm is assigned to the 4f7(8S7/2)–4f65d transitions of the Eu2+ ions [9]. Furthermore, a high and similar reflectance platform appears in the wavelength range of 450–800nm for both samples. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that doping Eu2+ in the Ca5(PO4)3Br host can enhance optical absorption in near-UV region. In addition, the fundamental absorption edge of the Ca5(PO4)3Br host can be determined by the following equation [19,20] (1) Αhʋ=A(hʋ−Eg)n where h is Planck’s constant, A is the absorption constant, Eg is the optical bandgap energy, n is a constant exponent which determines the type of optical transitions. In this paper, for this Ca5(PO4)3Br host, n=0.5. α is absorption coefficient and is proportional to F(R), which can be expressed by the following equation [21] (2) F(R)= ( 1 − R ) 2 2R where R can be considered as the experimental reflectance in our sample. F(R) is the Kubelka-Munk function. The inset of Fig. 5 shows the plot of {[F(R)]hʋ}2 versus hʋ. A tangent line is drawn in the near edge region of the curve which is converted from Fig. 5. Hence, the bandgap energy Eg is determined to be 3.795eV by the crossing point of the tangent line and the horizontal axis. Fig. 6 depicts the PLE (λem =458nm) and PL (λex =365nm) spectra of the representative Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ phosphor. The PLE spectrum contains two broad absorption bands from 320 to 440nm originating from the 4f7(8S7/2)–4f65d transitions of Eu2+ ions, indicating that the excitation wavelength of Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors matches well with the output wavelength of near-UV light chips [9]. The PL spectrum exhibits a 38.2nm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) asymmetric broad emission band located at 458nm, which can be ascribed to the 4f65d-4f7(8S7/2) transitions of Eu2+ ions [9]. It is well known that the emission of the Eu2+ activator is quite related to its lattice site occupation, and thus often gives the different emission wavelengths. Therefore, the asymmetric emission band of Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ phosphor indicates that there may exist different types of Eu2+ luminescent centers. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the asymmetric emission hump can be deconvoluted into two Gaussian bands (short-dot lines in Fig. 6) with peaks at 456 and 467nm, respectively. As given in the former crystallographic coordination information of the Ca5(PO4)3Br lattice, we can infer that the Eu2+ ions substitute two Ca2+ crystallographic sites with different coordination numbers 6 and 7, which results in two luminescence centers corresponding to two fitted emission bands in Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors. Van Uitert provides us the relationship between the crystallographic site and the emission position of Eu2+ as follows [22] (3) E = Q [ 1 − ( V / 4 ) 1 V × 10 − ( n ⋅ E a ⋅ r ) / 80 ] where E stands for the position for the Eu2+ ion emission peak (cm−1), Q represents the position in energy for the lower d-band edge for the Eu2+ ion (cm−1), V denotes the valence of the “active” Eu2+ ion, n is the number of anions in the immediate shell around the Eu2+ ion, Ea is the electron affinity of the atoms that form anions (eV), and r is the radius of the host cation occupied by the Eu2+ ion (Å). In the same host, Q, V and Ea have the same value for two substituted sites. Hence the value of E has a positive relationship with the product of n and r from Eq. (3). Here, the radius of Ca2+ is 1.00Å when the coordination number is 6, whereas that is 1.06Å when the coordination number is 7. Therefore, we can conclude that the deconvoluted Gaussian curve centering at 456nm (21930cm−1) is attributed to the substitution of 7-coordinated Eu2+ ions (denoted as Eu(1)2+) while another deconvoluted Gaussian curve centering at 467nm (21413cm−1) is due to the substitution of 6-coordinated Eu2+ ions (denoted as Eu(2)2+). The above luminescence properties of Eu2+ ions in different sites are also elucidated according to the schematic configuration coordination model. As represented in Fig. 7 , the schematic configuration coordination model involves two following key factors: the electron-vibrational coupling and the interaction between the neighboring Eu(1)2+ ions and Eu(2)2+ ions in the Ca5(PO4)3Br lattice. In the process of absorption, the electrons are vertically excited from the equilibrium ground state to the non-equilibrium excited state by absorbing energy. Subsequently, the electrons arrive at the equilibrium excited state by means of releasing relaxation energy (Er) to the Ca5(PO4)3Br lattice. The radiation process is the opposite of the absorption process. The electrons located at equilibrium excited state can plummet to the non-equilibrium ground state, and then revert to the equilibrium ground state location by relaxation. Due to the different crystal field strengths of Eu(1)2+ ions and Eu(2)2+ ions, their electrons in the 4f65d1 excited states are located at different energy levels, which in turn leads to the transition to the ground state with different energy values and different optical properties between Eu(1)2+ ions and Eu(2)2+ ions [23]. Meanwhile, some excited electrons are easily transferred from Eu(1)2+ ions to Eu(2)2+ ions through the intersection of the S point by overcoming the energy barrier (Es) and finally revert to the ground state to give the longer wavelength emission. Notably, as seen in Fig. 6, there is a significant spectral overlap between its excitation and emission spectra, which can be regarded as the evidence of the energy transfer from Eu(1)2+ to Eu(2)2+ ions in the Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ phosphor. According to Dexter’s report, the principle of energy transfer can be expressed as follows [24,25] (4) P SA = 2 π h | 〈 S,A ∗ | H SA | S ∗ ,A 〉 | 2 ∫ g S ( E ) g A ( E ) dE where PSA represents energy transfer rate and HSA is the interaction Hamiltonian. The matrix elements demonstrate the interaction between the initial state | S ∗ ,A 〉 and the final state 〈 S,A ∗ | . The integral indicates the overlap between the PL spectra of a sensitizer and the PLE spectra of an activator. Based on the above consideration, there consequently exists the resonance-type energy transfer in Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+. Meanwhile, Fig. 8 gives the luminescence decay curves of the Ca4.91(PO4)3Br: 0.09Eu2+ phosphor for Eu(1)2+ (456nm) and Eu(2)2+ (467nm) emission under 365nm excitation, respectively. The decay curves can be well fitted with the second-order exponential decay model as [26] (5) I = I 0 + A 1 exp ( − t / τ 1 ) + A 2 exp ( − t / τ 2 ) where I and I0 are the luminescence intensities at time t and 0 respectively, A1 and A2 are the constants, τ 1 and τ 2 are two exponential components for decay time. Thus, the average decay times (τ ∗) can be calculated as follows [27] (6) τ ∗ = A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 Hence, the average decay times of Eu(1)2+ and Eu(2)2+ are calculated to be 442 and 476ns for Ca4.91(PO4)3Br: 0.09Eu2+ phosphor, respectively. It is clear that the average decay times of Eu(1)2+ and Eu(2)2+ are distinct, which further certifies there are two luminescence centers in the Eu2+-doped Ca5(PO4)3Br phosphors. Fig. 9 illustrates the PL spectra of Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ (x =0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10) phosphors upon 365nm excitation. With increasing the Eu2+ ion concentration, the emission intensity of Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors initially increases and reaches a maximum at x =0.07, then decreases due to the concentration quenching. The occurrence of concentration quenching is mainly caused by the energy transfer from an activator to another. It is known that two kinds of mechanisms can be explanatory for the energy transfer: exchange interaction or electric multipolar interaction [28]. To further understand the concentration quenching process, the critical distance (Rc) for energy transfer among Eu2+ ions can be given by the Blasse equation [29] (7) R c = 2 [ 3 V 4 π x c N ] 1 / 3 where x c is the critical concentration, N means the number of available sites for the dopant in the unit cell, and V is the volume of the unit cell (Å3). In this case, x c is determined to be 0.07, N =2, and V =556.05Å3. Thus, the critical distance is calculated to be 19.65Å. Considering that the typical critical distance of the exchange interaction is normally around 5Å [30], the mechanism of exchange interaction may play little role in the energy transfer between Eu2+ ions in Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors. Therefore, the electric multipolar interactions should dominate the energy transfer process in these samples. To further understand the type of electric multipolar interaction, Dexter has pointed out the relationship between the emission intensity per activator ion (I/x) and the concentration of the activator (x) which is not less than the critical concentration [31]. (8) I / x = K [ 1 + β ( x ) Q / 3 ] − 1 where K and β are constants under the same excitation conditions for a given host lattice, and Q is a function of multipole–multipole interaction, while Q equals 6, 8 or 10 corresponding to dipole-dipole, dipole-quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole interactions, respectively. Assuming that β ( x ) Q / 3 » 1, Eq. (8) can be simplified as follows (9) lg ( I / x ) = K ′ − Q 3 lg ( x ) The inset of Fig. 9 shows the linear dependence of lg I/x on lg x. The slope of the straight line is −1.688. Thus, the calculated value of Q is roughly approximate to 6, meaning that the energy transfer among Eu2+ ions takes place mainly via the dipole–dipole mechanism. On the basis of the dipole–dipole interaction, an alternative critical distance Rc 6 for energy transfer can be estimated by using the Dexter formula [30] (10) R c 6 = 0 .63 × 1 0 28 Q a E 4 ∫ f s ( E ) F a ( E ) dE (11) Q a = 4 .8 × 1 0 − 16 fd where Qa is absorption coefficient of Eu2+ ion, fd is electric dipole transition oscillator strength, E is energy of maximum spectral overlap, fs(E) and Fa(E) are normalized excitation and emission spectrum functions, respectively. fd is taken as 0.02 for Eu2+, and the values of E and ∫fs(E)Fa(E)dE are determined from the normalized excitation and emission spectrum to be 5.96eV and 0.72eV−1 for Ca4.97(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+. Therefore, the critical distance Rc 6 of 18.04Å for energy transfer from Eu(1)2+ to Eu(2)2+ can be obtained, which is consistent with the result by Blasse equation. Additionally, Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ and commercial BAM: Eu2+ (NICHIA, NP-107) phosphors under 365nm excitation are shown in Fig. 10 . Their color coordinates are calculated to be (x =0.1450, y =0.0840) and (x =0.1449, y =0.0590), respectively. The color purity of a dominant color is the weight average of the emission color coordinates relative to the coordinates of the dominant wavelength and the CIE white illumination coordinates, which can be calculated by the following equation [32] (12) Color purity = ( x − x i ) 2 + ( y − y i ) 2 ( x d − x i ) 2 + ( y d − y i ) 2 × 100 % where (x, y) are the color coordinates of the as-prepared phosphors, (xi =0.3333, yi =0.3333) represent the CIE white light source coordinates, and (xd , yd ) are the coordinates of the dominant wavelength point. Finally, the color purities of Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ and commercial BAM: Eu2+ (NP-107) phosphors can be calculated to be 89.77% and 94.49%, respectively, meaning that the color purity of Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ phosphor is close to that of the commercial BAM: Eu2+ phosphor. Meanwhile, the inset of Fig. 10 provides the digital photograph of the Ca4.93(PO4)3Br: 0.07Eu2+ phosphor under 365nm UV lamp. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have presented the synthesis, structure, morphology and luminescence properties of Ca5-x (PO4)3Br: xEu2+ phosphors. The phosphors offered a broad excitation band extending from 320 to 440nm and a broad blue emission band peaking at 458nm upon 365nm excitation. It was indicated that Eu2+ randomly substituted two Ca2+ crystallographic sites with different coordination environments. The optimized concentration of Eu2+ was determined to be 0.07 in the Ca5(PO4)3Br host and the energy transfer mechanism among Eu2+ ions in our phosphors was certified to be dipole–dipole interaction by theoretical calculation. Due to the strong absorption in the near-UV region as well as the intense blue emission, our phosphor is expected to be the potential candidate as blue component for near-UV-pumped white LEDs.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.120,Optical and photocatalytic properties of lysozyme mediated titanium dioxide nanoparticles,"Abstract Titanium dioxide nanoparticles using lysozyme (L:TiO2) were prepared through a facile synthesis. Structural, morphological and optical properties of L: TiO2 were compared with synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles prepared without lysozyme. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns showed dominance of anatase phase in L:TiO2 whereas rutile phase in TiO2. Their grain size was reduced from 38 to 17nm on using lysozyme. Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) study revealed the existence of chemical bonding of Titanium and Oxygen in both phases. The band gap energy was decreased from 3.3 to 3.1eV on employing lysozyme. L:TiO2 nanoparticles showed better performance than TiO2 in photocatalytic degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) and Methyl Orange (MO) under ultraviolet irradiation.",Feb-18," Keywords TiO2 Lysozyme Band gap Languir-Hinshelwood kinetics Photocatalytic degradation 1 Introduction Dyes are widely used in the industry. Now a days, industrial dye pollutants are one of the main reasons of water contamination. Most dyes are very hard to degrade because of their chemical structures and stability. These dyestuffs are colored and their presence block the sunlight and oxygen, which in turn affecting the aquatic life [1]. For the sake of the environment, there is a high demand of treating these colored effluents before discharging them. Therefore, new cheap and more efficient methods are being searched. For this purpose, photocatalytic effect of TiO2 has drawn much attention because it is one of the promising materials for the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. TiO2 is applied for treating wastewater containing organic contaminants due to its ability to achieve complete mineralization of the organic contaminants under mild conditions such as ambient temperature and pressure [2]. Furthermore, TiO2 is stable, relatively low cost and non-toxic material [3] that exists in three main crystalline forms: anatase, rutile and brookite [4]. Rutile is the most thermodynamically stable phase [5] whereas anatase and brookite are metastable phases [6]. However, due to large surface area per unit mass and volume, anatase TiO2 has greater photo-catalytic activity compared to rutile [7]. Many papers concerning different methods of synthesizing TiO2 nanostructured materials have been published such as reverse micelle method [8], hydrothermal method [9], solvothermal method [10], microwave method [11], anodizing method [12], chemical vapor deposition [13], electrophoretic deposition [14], sonochemical method [15], and sol-gel method [16]. To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles using lysozyme has not been reported so far. Therefore, we have reported simple and low cost sol-gel method for the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles with lysozyme for the first time. The sol–gel method has many advantages with respect to the other methods in terms of purity, homogeneity, low processing temperature and stoichiometry control. Lysozyme, which occurs naturally in human tears, saliva, egg white, and other body fluids, is capable of destroying the cell walls of certain bacteria and thereby acting as a mild antiseptic [17]. In this work, lysozyme is used as a representative of enzyme. The purpose of employing lysozyme is getting free from agglomeration during nanoparticles formation and particle size reduction in order to enhance the efficiency of the photocatalytic effect. Here, we found particle size reduction on using lysozyme in the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles. And we investigated photocatalytic degradation of the product TiO2 nanoparticles with and without lysozyme in decomposing MB and MO under ultraviolet light. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of L:TiO2 nanoparticles Chemicals used in this research work were of analytical reagent grade and used without any further refinement. All aqueous solutions were made using deionized water. For TiO2 nanoparticles preparation, Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) of Sigma-Aldrich was used as a starting material. 20mL of TTIP was mixed with 60mL of ethanol and 200mL of deionized water along with few drops of concentrated HNO3 under constant magnetic stirring for 4h at 80°C. The mixture solution was kept in a standstill position for 120h for decantation. The decanted particles were filtered and washed with ethanol and then dried at 100°C for 4h. The dried mass was grinded and calcined in a muffle furnace at 500°C for 2h. And the dried crystals were transferred to a mortar and finally grinded to a fine powder of TiO2 nanoparticles. In the same fashion as mentioned above, L:TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by dissolving 0.02g of lysozyme from chicken egg white (Sigma-Aldrich) with 200mL of de-ionized water, 20mL of TTIP, 60mL of ethanol and few drops of concentrated HNO3. All the other processes of stirring, drying, calcining and grinding were same as described in the former case. Stable L:TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized without any noticeable precipitation. The schematic diagram in Fig. 1 represents the experimental process. 2.2 Photocatalytic activity investigation The photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples were investigated in the degradation of MB and MO dyes in aqueous solution. In each case, 0.1g of photocatalyst was suspended in 50mL of dye solution (10ppm concentration). The solution was continuously stirred for 10min in dark to ensure the establishment of an adsorption-desorption equilibrium among the photocatalyst, dye and water. Then the solution was exposed to UV- irradiation (λ =365nm) from 250W high pressure Hg lamp. Aliquots were taken at 30min time interval and centrifuged to remove the residual photocatalyst and then the concentration of dye solution was measured by recording the optical absorbance using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. 3 Characterization X-ray diffraction analysis of the synthesized nanoparticles were carried out using CuKα radiation of D2 phaser Bruker at room temperature, ranging 2θ value from 20° to 80° with a scanning rate of 0.01° per second. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were captured using Carl Zeiss AG – SUPRA 55VP, Germany. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies were performed from 400 to 4000cm−1 with SHIMADZU IR Tracer-100 FTIR spectrometer. Similarly, the optical absorption spectra were measured between 300 and 800nm by Cary 60 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Morphological and structural properties Fig. 2 shows the typical FESEM images results of all samples. The morphologies and the particle sizes of L:TiO2 and TiO2 are shown respectively in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Fig. 2(a) shows a well-defined L:TiO2 nanoparticles with an average size of 20nm. The particles of TiO2 particles are nearly spherical shaped with size of 40nm (Fig. 2b). Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of the synthesized samples. It can be seen that all the XRD peaks are clear and sharp. This evidence suggests that as prepared samples are well crystallized. Since the photocatalytic activity depends considerably on the crystallinity and crystalline phases of TiO2, it is ensured from this result. The XRD pattern of L:TiO2 nanoparticles indicates the dominance of anatase phase as shown in Fig. 3(a). The peak position at 25.56° is in accordance with anatase phase of (101) diffraction plane. This peak does not overlap with any other peaks of rutile. Similarly the peaks of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 3(b) depict the dominance of rutile phase with intense peak at 27.67° corresponding to (110) plane. These experimental XRD patterns agree with JCPDS card number 21-1272 (anatase) and 21-1276 (rutile). From the XRD analysis, it can be clearly stated that the synthesized samples are a mixture of anatase and rutile in both cases. The crystallite size was calculated by the Debye Scherer’s formula given below [18], (1) D =(0.9λ)/βcosθ Where, λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation, β is the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), θ is the diffracting angle. The average crystalline size of TiO2 and L:TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized are 38nm and 17nm respectively. This fact is in good agreement with FESEM results. The size of L:TiO2 nanoparticles is reduced to more than half. It could be because of role of lysozyme in squeezing the colloidal suspensions and thereby limiting agglomeration. 4.2 Optical properties 4.2.1 FT-IR spectra analysis To confirm the presence of Ti-O stretching bond, FTIR spectra were measured at room temperature. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show the FT-IR spectra of L:TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles respectively. Both spectra show the peak over the range of 400–700cm−1 which are attributed to the Ti-O-Ti bending and stretching vibration and characteristic of well-ordered TiO6 octahedra [19]. Peak at 2362cm−1 corresponds to CH stretching vibration. Peaks around 1625 and 3450 corresponds to the stretching mode of the OH group and bending mode of molecular water respectively [20]. 4.2.2 Band gap measurement The band gap of TiO2 and L:TiO2 nanoparticles were measured by studying the optical absorption spectra from the UV–vis spectrophotometer. Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectra of (a) L:TiO2 and (b) TiO2 in the wavelength range from 300 to 800nm. Fig. 6 shows the absorption edge of the spectra is shifted to a lower energy (red shift) on using lysozyme, where a reduction of particle size is observed. This red shift of band edge of TiO2 could be due to the overlapping of conduction band Ti(3d) with d levels of the transition metals [21]. The optical band gap of synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles was estimated by the extrapolation of the linear portion of (αhν)2 versus photon energy (hν) plots. For the allowed direct transition, the variation in α with the photon energy obey Tauc’s plot method [22] (2) ( α h υ ) 2 = A ( h υ − E g ) Where A is a constant, Eg is the optical band gap, h is the plank constant and α is the absorption coefficient. The plot of (αhν)2 versus photon energy for TiO2 nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 6. The extrapolation at (α)2 =0 yields the optical band gap energy. Their band gap energy calculated by UV–vis spectroscopy were 3.3 and 3.1eV for TiO2 and L:TiO2 respectively. The practicable photocatalysts should have a band gap energy comparable to the energy of photons of visible or ultraviolet light (less than 3.5eV). The rutile has a band gap of 3.00eV and that of anatase has 3.21eV [23]. Moreover, there are many papers mentioning the band gap energy of anatase in the range of 2.86 and 3.34eV. The differences are due to variations in the stoichiometric of synthesis, impurities present, crystalline size and type of electronic transition [24,25]. As the particle size gets smaller and reaches nano scale, the number of overlapping orbitals or energy levels decrease and the width of the band starts to narrow. As a result, the gap between the valence and the conduction bands increases with the decrease in particle size. Here it seems the reverse case. The particle size has reduced using lysozyme and the band gap energy has also decreased. The reason could be nanoparticles were in the mixed states of anatase and rutile. Another reason could be attributed by mild delocalization of molecular orbitals on the surface, which in turn creates deep and shallow traps near the band edge of its electronic state and hence brings reduction in the band gap [26]. Photocatalytic performances of the prepared samples under UV-light irradiation towards the photocatalytic degradation of MB and MO dye solution are shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). The degradation is represented as the variation of (C/Co) with irradiation time, where Co and C are the concentrations of dye solutions at the initial time and at time t, respectively. From these results, it is clear that more than 90% degradation of MB dye solution and more than 80% degradation of MO solution was occurred in 180min in case of utilizing L:TiO2 nanoparticles. Contrastingly, TiO2 nanoparticles showed less performances within this time. Here, we believe that the higher photocatalytic activity of L:TiO2 nanoparticles is due the smaller particle size with large surface area, which are preferable for photocatalysis under UV-light irradiation. In this case the solid L-TiO2 is more active not only because of the small particle size and high specific surface area, but also because of its crystallographic composition. The absorbance variations of MB and MO dye solution utilizing L:TiO2 nanoparticles under UV-light irradiation at different time are shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). The absorption peaks corresponding to MB at 665nm and MO at 464nm are diminished gradually with increase in irradiation time. Moreover, in this work the maximum absorption peaks were not shifted, which indicated that benzene/heterocyclic rings were decomposed rather than simple decolorization process [27]. The kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of MB and MO solutions utilizing L:TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were evaluated by using Languir-Hinshelwood model. (3) r = − d c d t = k r K C 1 + K C Because the initial concentration of reactant was very low (C0 =10mg/L for MB and MO), Eq. (3) could be reduced to the pseudo first-order kinetics equation [28] as, (4) l n C 0 / C = k a p p t Where, C0 and C are the initial concentration and concentration at time (t), respectively and kapp is the apparent rate constant (min−1) determined by plotting ln (C0/C) versus reaction time. Using Eq. (4), the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of MB and MO solutions were investigated and results are depicted in Fig. 8 . As shown in the figure the relationship of ln (C0/C) versus reaction time was almost linear, suggesting the photocatalytic degradation reaction could follow pseudo-first order kinetics. According to the results the apparent rate constant of MB and MO degradation over L:TiO2 nanoparticles were determined to be 0.014min−1 and 0.011min−1. At the same time the rate constant over TiO2 nanoparticles were determined to be 0.009min−1 and 0.008min−1. This indicated that the photocatalytic degradation rate of L:TiO2 nanoparticles was distinctly higher than that of TiO2 nanoparticles. From this fact it can be concluded that lysozyme had a vital role to enhance the photocatalytic activity of L:TiO2 nanoparticles under UV-light irradiation. In addition, it is supposed that the formation of phase junction between TiO2 nanoparticles is responsible for the higher photocatalytic activity as the synthesized samples were in the mixed phases of anatase and rutile, which might have contributed their synergistic effect for dye degradation [29]. Based on these results, the mechanism for photocatalytic degradation of dye solution utilizing phase-junction TiO2 nanoparticles under UV-light irradiation is proposed in Fig. 9 . As shown in the figure, photo excited electrons (e−) flow from rutile to anatase, where as the holes (h+) move from anatase to rutile. Thus the recombination of hole and electron is prevented [30]. During photo degradation process, the photo excited and transferred electrons on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles get trapped by dissolved oxygen to form O2 −, HO2 and H2O2, where O2 or electrons can further react with H2O2 to generate OH. At the same time, photo generated holes react with water or OH− to produce HO radicals. Hence, in both cases OH radicals are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of dye solutions [31]. 5 Conclusions A facile method has been developed to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles using lysozyme. From X-ray diffraction measurement, the synthesized samples were found in the mixed phases of anatase and rutile both in L:TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles, where L:TiO2 showed dominance of anatase phase. In contrast, TiO2 nanoparticles depicted the dominance of rutile phase. Their grain size estimated from Scherrer equation was found to be decreased from 38 to 17nm on using lysozyme. FTIR study revealed the existence of chemical bonding of Ti and O. The band gap energy calculated by UV–vis spectroscopy was decreased from 3.3 to 3.1eV on employing lysozyme. L:TiO2 nanoparticles showed better performance in photocatalytic degradation of MB and MO under ultraviolet irradiation than TiO2 particles prepared without lysozyme. The photocatalytic degradation reaction of both MB and MO followed the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The kinetic data showed the synthesized L:TiO2 are more effective for photocatalytic applications than the conventional TiO2 nanoparticles.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.021,The color tunability and mechanism of upconversion emissions in Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped Y2Ce2O7 phosphors,"Abstract Y2Ce2O7 powders doped with different Yb3+ and Er3+ concentrations were synthesized via the sol-gel method. The structure and upconversion properties were investigated. The results indicated that a single phase was obtained and that the structure was cubic. The green and red upconversion emissions were detected with excitation at 980nm, and the emission intensities could be tuned by the Yb3+ and Er3+ concentrations. The mechanism of the upconversion process was evaluated on the basis of the emission intensities and lifetimes of the 4S3/2, 4F9/2 and 4I13/2 levels. The results demonstrated that cross-relaxation was responsible for the dependence of green and red upconversion emissions on the dopant concentration.",Feb-18," Keywords Upconversion Color tunability Mechanism Y2Ce2O7:Yb3+,Er3+ 1 Introduction Upconversion is an anti-Stokes process in which a substance absorbs two or more low-energy photons and emits a higher-energy photon [1]. The upconversion of luminescent materials can be used in many fields, including optical temperature sensing, laser cooling and cell imaging [2–4]. Recently, explorations of the application of upconversion in solar cells and white-light emission have attracted much attention [5–7]. Lanthanide rare-earth (RE) ions are suitable candidates for the upconversion process because of their abundant energy levels and narrow emission spectral lines [8]; The Er3+ ion is the most efficient and popular RE ion for this application. To enhance the efficiency of upconversion emission of Er3+ ions, the Yb3+ ions are often co-doped into materials doped with Er3+ as a sensitizer. Furthermore, the fluorescent color of upconversion can be tuned by the concentration of the Yb3+ ion [9,10], which is useful for fluorescent labels or biological images. Host materials with low phonon energy are necessary to achieve efficient upconversion emissions. Such materials enable the multi-phonon relaxation rate to be reduced and the lifetime of excited levels to be increased [11]. Fortunately, Re2Ce2O7 with a pyrochlore structure or a defect fluorite-type structure has a low phonon energy (approximately 464cm−1 [12]) and excellent chemical stability [13] and is therefore a potential upconversion material. However, the literature contains few reports of the photoluminescence properties of RE-doped Re2Ce2O7 compounds. In this paper, we focus on the upconversion properties of Y2Ce2O7 phosphors co-doped with Yb3+ and Er3+. The mechanism of upconversion emission and the effects of the dopant concentrations on the color tunability are studied. 2 Experiment Y2Ce2O7 samples co-doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ were prepared by the sol-gel method. Y2O3 (99.99%), Yb2O3 (99.99%), Er2O3 (99.99%) and CeO2 (99.99%) were used as starting materials. According to the formula, (YbxEryY1-x-y)2Ce2O7 (y=0.02, x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1 and x=0.04, y=0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1), stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials were dissolved in nitric acid, and citric acid was then added into the solution as the chelating agent. The molar ratio of metal ions and citric acid was 1:2.5. H2O2 was added when CeO2 is dissolved using nitric acid. The mixture was stirred at approximately 90°C for 4h until a sol was formed. The sol was transformed into a sticky gel by evaporating the sol over several hours. The gel was dried at approximately 100°C in air. After being fully ground, the dried powders were sintered at 1200°C in a muffle furnace in air atmosphere for approximately 4h, and white powder samples were obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples in the range of 10°≤2θ≤90° were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with high-intensity CuK α radiation (λ=1.54178Å). The upconversion emission spectra were detected using a spectrophotometer (FL980, Edinburgh) with a laser diode (LD) as the pump source; the excitement wavelength was 980nm. The fluorescence decay curves, at a wavelength of 547, 677 and 1535nm, were also excited at 980nm by an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) in the same instrument. The signal was detected using an NIR PMT (R5509, Hamamatsu). All measurements were carried out at room temperature, and the spectra were corrected. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a)–(d) shows the XRD patterns of samples doped with different concentrations of Yb3+ and Er3+. From the figure, the diffraction peaks of Y2Ce2O7 agree with those of the standard card (JCPDS 09-0286), which indicates that the crystal structure belongs to the cubic system with space group Fm3m. No diffraction peaks from impurities were observed in the XRD patterns, indicating that pure, single-phase Y2Ce2O7 was obtained and that Yb3+ and Er3+ ions were incorporated into the Y2Ce2O7 lattice. Fig. 1(b) and (d) shows the 2θ range from 28.5° to 29.1° in the XRD patterns. With increasing concentrations of Yb3+ and Er3+, the (111) diffraction peaks at approximately 28.696° shift slightly toward higher angles, indicating that the lattice parameters of Y2Ce2O7:Yb,Er decrease. The unit-cell parameters were calculated on the basis of the XRD patterns; the results are summarized in Table 1 . The decrease in lattice parameters is attributed to the radii of the Er3+ (8.81nm) and Yb3+ (8.58nm) ions being smaller than the radius of the Y3+ ions (8.93nm) they replace [14]. These results further demonstrate that Yb3+ and Er3+ ions had entered the host lattice. Furthermore, in the case of the Y2Ce2O7 sample doped with 4 at% Yb3+ and 4 at% Er3+, the (111) diffraction peak shifts to a higher angle than the corresponding peak in the XRD patterns of the other samples, which may be due to the random distribution of Yb3+ and Er3+ ions in the host. Fig. 2 (a) demonstrates the dependence of upconversion emissions on the Yb3+ concentration when excited by 980nm light. Two upconversion emission bands are observed in the range 500–750nm: a green one at approximately 547nm and a red one at approximately 677nm, corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ion, respectively. The upconversion emission intensities (green and red) in samples doped only with Er3+ can be neglected in comparison to those in samples doped with both Yb3+ and Er3+. The green emission intensities decrease with increasing Yb3+ concentration, whereas the red emission intensities increase with increasing Yb3+ concentration. Fig. 2(b) demonstrates the CIE chromaticity coordinates of samples doped with different Yb3+ concentrations; the values are listed in Table 1. The upconversion emissions range from yellowish-green to red, depending on the Yb3+ concentration, when excited with 980-nm light, which indicates that the color of emissions can be tuned by the Yb3+ concentration. However, the color cannot be efficiently tuned via the Er3+ concentration. Fig. 2(c) demonstrates the dependence of upconversion emissions on the Er3+ concentration under excitation at 980nm. The green and red emission intensities decrease with increasing Er3+ concentrations. The color coordinates are located at the yellow region for samples doped with different concentrations of Er3+, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and Table 1. Our previous work demonstrates that the mechanism for green and red upconversion emissions is a two-photon process [15]. Because of the large absorption cross-section of the Yb3+ ion at 980nm and the resonance between the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ ion and the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 transition of Er3+ ion, the energy-transfer (ET) process dominates samples co-doped with Yb3+ and Er3+. The Er3+ ion can be excited to the 4I11/2 level from the 4I15/2 level via the ET process from Yb3+ to Er3+ (ET process in Fig. 3 ) or via direct excitation. The proportion of Er3+ ions at the 4I11/2 level will be excited to the 4F7/2 level after absorbing another pump photon. The Er3+ ion at the 4F7/2 level will nonradiatively decay to the 4S3/2 and then the 4F9/2 level; the green and red emissions can be derived when the Er3+ ions on these two levels relax to the ground 4I15/2 level, respectively. Another portion of Er3+ ions on the 4I11/2 level will nonradiatively relax to the 4I13/2 level and then be populated to the 4F9/2 level by the cross-relaxation (CR) process, 2F5/2 (Yb)+ 4I13/2 (Er)→ 2F7/2(Yb)+4F9/2 (Er); thus, the red emission can be derived from the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. Therefore, the 4F9/2 level can be populated via two channels: nonradiative transition process (4S3/2 → 4F9/2) and CR process (4I13/2 → 4F9/2). The CR process is dominant for the upconversion red emission. Because the radiative and nonradiative transitions are intrinsic transitions, they are independent of the dopant concentration. If the nonradiative transition process is dominant, the ratio of upconversion of red-to-green emission (R) cannot be changed by varying the Yb3+ concentration. Actually, the ratio R increases from 0.38 to 46.67 with increasing Yb3+ concentration, as shown in Fig. 4 . Therefore, upconversion green emission competes with the red emission. When the Yb3+ concentration is increased, the distance between the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions is shortened, and the CR process becomes more efficient, resulting in a decrease in the upconversion green emissions and enhancement of the upconversion red emissions. This process can be confirmed by the various lifetimes of the 4I13/2 level of the Er3+ ion, as shown in Fig. 5 . The lifetime decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration in samples doped with both Yb3+ and Er3+, which indicates that an additional decay channel is introduced by Yb3+. The distance between the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration, and the probability of the CR process increases. Thus, the lifetime of the 4I13/2 level decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration. In contrast to the declining tendency of lifetimes of the 4I13/2 level with increasing Yb3+ concentration, the emission intensity of the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition increases and then decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration, as shown in Fig. 6 . This behavior may be due to the following effects: (1) The distance between the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration, and the ET becomes more efficient; thus, the population of the 4I13/2 level increases. Although the CR process can depopulate the 4I13/2 level, the net population still increases and the emission intensity increases. (2) Another CR occurs, 4S3/2 (Er)+ 2F7/2 (Yb)→ 4I13/2 (Er)+ 2F5/2 (Yb) (marked as CR1 in Fig. 3) [16]. This CR1 process can be confirmed by the variety of lifetimes of the4S3/2 level of the Er3+ ion shown in Fig. 7 . In samples doped with higher Yb3+ concentrations, the CR process is dominant, and the emission intensity of the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition decreases. In addition, the lifetimes of the 4F9/2 level of Er3+ in samples doped with different Yb3+ concentrations are also shown in Fig. 7. These lifetimes increase with increasing Yb3+ concentration when the Yb3+ concentration is not higher than 4 at%, which is caused by the greater probability of the CR process because of the shorter distance between Yb3+ and Er3+ as Yb3+ concentration increases. If the Yb3+ concentration is higher than 4 at%, the lifetime will decrease. Some authors have speculated that the Er3+ ion will be excited to the 2H9/2 level with phonon assistance in samples doped with high Yb3+ concentrations [17,18]. However, in our work, the upconversion emissions in the range from 400 to 500nm were not observed. Therefore, the pairing or aggregation of Yb3+ ions may turn some of those ions into quenchers [19]. However, the reverse CR process, 2F7/2(Yb)+ 4F9/2 (Er)→ 2F5/2 (Yb)+ 4I13/2 (Er), may be responsible for this result. Higher Er3+ concentrations adversely affect the upconversion emission. Fig. 2(b) demonstrates that the green and red upconversion emissions, along with the lifetimes of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels, decrease with increasing Er3+ concentration (shown in Fig. 8 ). The results demonstrate that interactions between Er3+ ions become stronger with decreasing distance between Er3+ ions due to increasing Er3+ concentrations. Therefore, the CR process among Er3+ ions cannot be neglected. The CR2 process, 4S3/2 (Er)+ 4I15/2 (Er)→ 4I9/2(Er)+ 4I13/2 (Er), which depends on the Er3+ concentration, reduces the population at the 4S3/2 level and the lifetime of this level in samples doped with high Er3+ concentrations [20]. Furthermore, the back energy transfer (BET) from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions will induce reduced intensities of upconversion emission [21]. The reduced lifetimes of the 4F9/2 level are due to the formation of clusters of Er3+ ions [22]. 4 Conclusions Single phases of Y2Ce2O7 phosphors doped with different Yb3+ and Er3+ concentrations were obtained in this work. Green and red upconversion emissions were observed under excitation by 980nm light. The intensities of the green emissions decrease with increasing Yb3+ concentration, whereas the red emission intensities increase with increasing Yb3+ concentration. However, the green and red upconversion emissions decrease with increasing Er3+ concentration. The color of emissions can be tuned from yellowish to red by changing the Yb3+ concentration, whereas the color is in the yellow region for samples doped with different Er3+ concentrations. The green upconversion emission competed with that of the red. The mechanisms for the green and red upconversion were investigated and confirmed by the emission intensities and lifetimes. In samples doped with different concentrations of Yb3+ or Er3+, the CR processes (CR, CR1, and CR2) between dopants were dominant. In brief, the upconversion process in Y2Ce2O7 phosphors doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ is very complicated and should be investigated further.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.009,Relativistic self-focusing of finite Airy-Gaussian beams in collisionless plasma using the Wentzel‐Kramers‐Brillouin approximation,"Abstract In this paper, we present a preliminary study of relativistic self-focusing of finite Airy-Gaussian beams in collisionless plasma taking into consideration the relativistic nonlinearity in the dielectric constant. The differential equation for the beam width parameter of the finite Airy-Gaussian beam is derived by using Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) and paraxial approximations through parabolic wave equation approach. The behavior of beam width parameter with distance of propagation is investigated at different parameters of plasma and those of the considered beams family. Our results detect that the beam is more focused at higher values aperture coefficient and higher intensity parameter. Furthermore, a strong oscillatory behavior of the beam width parameter and better focusing during laser propagation in plasma is apparent.",Feb-18," Keywords Relativistic self-focusing Finite Airy-Gaussian beam Collisionless plasma 1 Introduction Over the past several decades the interaction of high power laser beams with plasma has paved the way in various directions due to its large applications like, laser-electron acceleration [1], laser driven fusion [2], X-rays lasers [3], optical harmonic generation [4], etc. These applications required that the beam is very powerful intense and propagates for prolonged distances with convergence, resulting in different nonlinear phenomena such as relativistic and pondermotive self-focusing, etc. It’s known that self-focusing effect is principally due to the change of dielectric constant when intense laser beam propagates through plasma. The high intensity of laser supply sufficient energy to the electron of plasma and produces an increase of the relativistic mass of electron. This gives rise to non-linearity caused the relativistic self-focusing effect. In the plasma, the self-focusing of laser beams has been theoretically studied by Akhmanov et al. [5], Hora [6], Litvak [7], Max et al. [8], Sodha et al. [9], and Brandi et al. [10], etc. Lately, the relativistic self-focusing has been discussed by several authors. Sharma [11], Nanda and Kant [12], and Wani and Kant [13] have theoretically investigated the relativistic self-focusing of Hermite-Gaussian beam, Hermite-cosh-Gaussian beam, Hermite-cosine-Gaussian beam, respectively. Patil et al. have examined many works of the relativistic self-focusing for Gaussian laser beam in plasma [14–16], and other theoretical and experimental works concern the relativistic self-focusing have been treated [17–24]. On the other hand, curved laser beams have attracted the attention of several researchers in the lasers physics from the introduction of the Airy wave packets for the first time by Berry and Balazs [25] in 1979 within the context of quantum mechanics. But, these beams require truncation because they take infinite energy. Concerning the last type of beams, the finite energy Airy beam [26,27] has known a great of interest because of their unique properties among them self-acceleration [26], self-healing [28], and even large applications in many domains such as in optically clearing particles [29], plasma guidance [30,31], vacuum electron acceleration [32,33], trapping and guiding microparticles [34,35]. Many authors have been interested to the finite Airy-Gaussian beams. Ez-zariy et al. [36] have studied propagation characteristics of Airy-Gaussian beams passing through a misaligned optical system with finite aperture. Deng et al. have discussed the propagation of the Airy-Gaussian beams in Kerr media [37], strongly nonlocal nonlinear media [38], and uniaxial crystals [39]. The properties of Airy-Gaussian beams in the fractional Fourier system have been treated by Zhou et al. [40]. Recently, Shi et al. have investigated the interaction of Airy-Gaussian beams in defected photonic lattices [41]. For all these reasons, we are interesting to the study of the relativistic self-focusing for finite Airy-Gaussian laser beam in collisionless plasma. By using WKB and paraxial approximations through the parabolic equation, a mathematical expression for the beam width parameter in plasma will be derived from the wave equation and its variation with the distance of propagation will be presented. The results of this study will be illustrated in the form of graphs where each parameter of the plasma and the considered beam family has a great importance for change the nature of self-focusing. The planning of the paper is as follows: After a brief introduction, we present the essential equations and we derive the nonlinear differential equations governing the beam width parameters in Section 2. In Section 3, the analytical expression for dimensionless initial beam with her graph is given. We discuss numerically results of finite Airy-Gaussian laser beam in collisionless plasma in details in Section 4. Finally, a simple conclusion is provided in Section.5. 2 Theory phenomenological The field distribution of finite Airy-Gaussian laser beam propagating in collisionless plasma along z direction is of the following form (1) E ( x , y , z ) = E 0 f 1 ( z ) f 2 ( z ) A i ( x r 0 f 1 ( z ) ) exp ( a 0 x r 0 f 1 ( z ) ) exp ( − x 2 r 0 2 f 1 2 ( z ) ) A i ( y r 0 f 2 ( z ) ) exp ( a 0 y r 0 f 2 ( z ) ) exp ( − y 2 r 0 2 f 2 2 ( z ) ) , where E 0 is the constant amplitude of the electric field, A i ( . ) is the Airy function of the first kind, r 0 is the waist width, a 0 is the modulation parameter (aperture coefficient), f 1 ( z ) and f 2 ( z ) are the dimensionless beam width parameters in the x and y directions, respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates the intensity distributions of finite Airy-Gaussian beam for different values of the modulation parameters a 0, with the transverse scale is ω 0 =0.8 mm. Depicted plots show that the Airy-Gaussian beam (with a 0 =0) carry an infinite energy. Intensity oscillations vanish gradually with the increase of a 0 and totally disappear when this modulation parameter approaches to 1. The propagation of finite Airy-Gaussian laser beam in plasma is characterized by the dielectric function which can, in general, be expressed as [42] (2) ε = ε 0 + φ ( E E ∗ ) , where ε 0 and φ are the linear and nonlinear parts of the dielectric function respectively and (3) ε 0 = 1 − ω p 2 / ω 2 , with ω is the angular frequency of laser beam, ω p is plasma frequency, given by ω p =4π n 0 e 2/m, n 0is the equilibrium electron density, e is the charge of the electron, m = m 0 γ, with m 0 is the rest mass, and γ is the relativistic factor which expressed by γ = 1 / 1 − υ 2 / c 2 . υ is the oscillatory velocity of electron and c is the speed of light in vacuum. The nonlinear dielectric constant for collisionless plasma is derived by Sodha [6], and represents by (4) φ ( E E ∗ ) = ω p 2 γ ω 2 [ 1 − exp ( − 3 4 m 0 γ M α E E ∗ ) ] , where α = e 2 M / 6 m 0 2 γ 2 ω 2 k B T , M is the mass of scatter in the plasma, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the equilibrium plasma temperature. The wave equation governing the electric field E of the beam in plasma can be written as (5) ∇ 2 E + ( ω 2 c 2 ) ε E + ∇ ( E ∇ ε ε ) = 0 . The last term of Eq. (5) on the left hand side can be neglected provided that k − 2 ∇ 2 ( ln ε ) < < 1 , where k is the wave number of the laser beam. Thus (6) ∇ 2 E + ( ω 2 c 2 ) ε E = 0 . Now, E = A ( x , y , z ) exp ( − i k z ) is introduced, where A ( x , y , z ) is the complex function of its argument. The behavior of A ( x , y , z ) is described by the parabolic equation in the WKB approximation, as (7) 2 i k ∂ A ∂ z = ∂ 2 A ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 A ∂ y 2 + k 2 ε 0 φ ( A A ∗ ) A = 0 . To solve Eq. (7) we write A ( x , y , z ) as (8) A ( x , y , z ) = A ( x , y , z ) 0 exp [ − i k S ( x , y , z ) ] , where k = ( ω / c ) ε 0 A 0 and S are real function of x, y and z (S being the eikonal of the beam). By substituting A ( x , y , z ) given by Eq. (8) into Eq. (7), one obtains (9) 2 ( ∂ S ∂ z ) + ( ∂ S ∂ x ) 2 + ( ∂ S ∂ y ) 2 = 1 k 2 A 0 ( ∂ 2 A 0 ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 A 0 ∂ y 2 ) + φ ( A 0 2 ) ε 0 , (10) ∂ A 0 2 ∂ z + ∂ S ∂ x ∂ A 0 2 ∂ x + ∂ S ∂ y ∂ A 0 2 ∂ y + A 0 2 ( ∂ 2 S ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 S ∂ y 2 ) = 0 . Following the approach given by Sodha et al. [6,42], the solutions of Eqs. (9) and (10) can be expressed as (11) S = x 2 2 f 1 ( z ) d f 1 ( z ) d z + y 2 2 f 2 ( z ) d f 2 ( z ) d z + φ ( z ) , and (12) A 0 2 = E 0 2 f 1 ( z ) f 2 ( z ) A i ( x r 0 f 1 ( z ) ) exp ( a 0 x r 0 f 1 ( z ) ) exp ( − x 2 r 0 2 f 1 2 ( z ) ) A i ( y r 0 f 2 ( z ) ) exp ( a 0 y r 0 f 2 ( z ) ) exp ( − y 2 r 0 2 f 2 2 ( z ) ) , where φ ( z ) is the axial phase. Finally, after some calculations, the dimensionless beam width parameters f 1 and f 2 are expressed by the following differential equations (13-a) d 2 f 1 ( z ) d ξ 2 = 1 f 1 3 − 3 4 ( ω 2 r 0 2 c 2 ) ω p 0 2 γ ω 2 m 0 γ M ( α E 0 2 ) c 1 5 f 1 2 f 2 ( a 0 g 1 + g 2 ) exp [ − 3 4 m 0 γ M α E 0 2 f 1 f 2 g 2 4 ] , and (13-b) d 2 f 2 ( z ) d ξ 2 = 1 f 2 3 − 3 4 ( r 0 2 ω 2 c 2 ) ω p 0 2 γ ω 2 m 0 γ M ( α E 0 2 ) c 1 5 f 1 f 2 2 ( a 0 g 1 + g 2 ) exp [ − 3 4 m 0 γ M α E 0 2 f 1 f 2 g 2 4 ] , with (14-a) g 1 = 1 / ( 3 3 Γ ( 1 / 3 ) ) , and (14-b) g 2 = 1 / ( 3 3 Γ ( 2 / 3 ) ) . In Eqs. (13), ξ = z/R d is the normalized propagation distance and R d = kr 0 is the Rayleigh length. The first term on the right hand side of Eqs. (13-a) and (13-b) is due to the diffraction effect and the second term is the nonlinear term that is responsible for relativistic self-focusing in collisionless plasma. Eqs. (13-a) and (13-b) can be solved numerically with appropriate boundary conditions. On the other hand, if the value of a 0 is equal to zero, Eqs. (13-a) and (13-b) reduce to the case of Airy-Gaussian beam, and thus the dimensionless beam width parameters f 1 and f 2 are expressed by the following differential equations (15-a) d 2 f 1 ( z ) d ξ 2 = 1 f 1 3 − 3 α E 0 2 4 ( ω 2 r 0 2 c 2 ) ω p 0 2 γ ω 2 m 0 γ M c 1 5 g 2 f 1 2 f 2 exp [ − 3 4 m 0 γ M α E 0 2 f 1 f 2 g 2 4 ] , and (15-b) d 2 f 2 ( z ) d ξ 2 = 1 f 2 3 − 3 α E 0 2 4 ( r 0 2 ω 2 c 2 ) ω p 0 2 γ ω 2 m 0 γ M c 1 5 g 2 f 1 f 2 2 exp [ − 3 4 m 0 γ M α E 0 2 f 1 f 2 g 2 4 ] , 3 Self-trapped mode For an initial plane wavefront at ξ =0, ( f 1 ) ξ = 0 = 1 , ( ∂ f 1 / ∂ ξ ) = 0 and ( f 2 ) ξ = 0 = 1 , ( ∂ f 2 / ∂ ξ ) = 0 , when ( ∂ 2 f 1 / ∂ ξ 2 ) = 0 and ( ∂ 2 f 2 / ∂ ξ 2 ) = 0 the initial beam width does not change along the propagation in the plasma and so-called self-trapped mode. These conditions and its corresponding graph are known as critical condition and the critical curve, by putting ( ∂ 2 f 1 / ∂ ξ 2 ) = 0 and ( ∂ 2 f 2 / ∂ ξ 2 ) = 0 in both Eqs. (13-a) and (13-b) respectively, the expression of dimensionless initial beam width ρ 0 ( = r 0 ω / c ) is given by (16) ρ 0 = 1 3 4 m 0 M ( α E 0 2 ) c 1 5 ( a 0 g 1 + g 2 ) exp [ 3 8 m 0 γ M α E 0 2 c 1 4 ] . The propagation of finite Airy-Gaussian beam in relativistic plasma can be explain by analyzing the dependence of dimensionless initial beam width ρ 0 as a function of intensity parameter α E 0 2 for the plasma under self-trapped condition. The results are given in Fig. 2 which illustrates the dependence of dimensionless beam width as a function of intensity parameter for four values of the aperture coefficient: a 0 =0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9. It can clearly see that the decrease of ρ 0 is observed with the increase of α E 0 2 for relativistic plasma and tends to be larger when the aperture coefficient is greater. Finally, the dimensionless initial beam width becomes independent of α E 0 2 . We indicate that when the value of a 0 is equal to zero, Eq. (16) reduces to the case of Airy-Gaussian beam. 4 Results and discussion In this section, Eqs. (13-a) and (13-b) are solved simultaneously by using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta technique, with a set laser-plasma parameters: r 0 =4×10−3 cm, n 0 =1.1×1019 cm −3, ω =3.75×1014 rad/s, ω p =1.87×1014 rad/s, γ =1.25, m 0/M =0.02, and maximum laser intensity is I 0 =5×1018 W/cm 2. We note that when we use the high power laser beam, the relativistic nonlinear effect arises from the relativistic mass adjustment and depends on the both parameters the intensity factor α E 0 2 and the relativistic plasma density ω p /ω. The relativistic effect leads to the self-focusing of the laser beam on account of nonlinear term while the diffraction term is responsible of the diffractional divergence of the beam. The variation of the beam width parameters f 1 and f 2 as a function of the normalized propagation distance ξ for different values of modulation parameter (a 0 =0.0,0.1, 0.5 and 0.9) with ω p /ω =0.6, and α E 0 2 = 42 is illustrated in Fig. 3 . It can be seen from this figure that strong self-focusing happens at ξ =2.98, ξ =2.26, ξ =1.41, and ξ =1.10 for a 0 =0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. Consequently, by increasing the modulation parameter a 0, self-focusing of finite Airy-Gaussian beam becomes better and shifted towards lower values of propagation distance ξ. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the beam width parameters f 1 and f 2 as a function of the normalized propagation distance ξ with various relative plasma density (ω p /ω =0.5, 0.6 and 0.7) where α E 0 2 = 60 . From Fig. (4-a), it is obvious that the strong self-focusing of Airy-Gaussian beam occurs at ξ =3.22, ξ =1.31, and ξ =0.94 for ω p /ω =0.5, 0.6 and 0.7, respectively. In the case of finite Airy-Gaussian beam Fig. (4-b), the self-focusing is stronger at ξ =1.42, ξ =0.94, and ξ =0.72 for ω p /ω =0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 respectively. It is also noted that the stronger and previous self-focusing of laser beam products with increase of plasma density. We can explain this result that when the plasma density becomes larger at relativistic intensities, the beam possess very large number of relativistic electrons will be carried by the laser pulse and hence a higher magnetic field is generated which increases the self-focusing. In Fig. 5 , the behavior of the beam width parameters f 1 and f 2 with the normalized propagation distance ξ is presented for three values of intensity parameter ( α E 0 2 = 40 ,60 and 100) at ω p /ω =0.6. It is observed that by increasing the value of intensity parameter the laser self-focusing tends to converge strongly and moved towards smaller value of normalized propagation distance, and becomes stronger for Airy-Gaussian beam (Fig. 5-a) at ξ =3.98, ξ =1.31, and ξ =0.80 for α E 0 2 = 40 , 60 and 100, respectively, and at ξ =1.49, ξ =0.93, and ξ =0.63 for α E 0 2 = 40 , 60 and 100, respectively for finite Airy-Gaussian beam (Fig. 5-b). This result is due to the dominance of self-focusing beam term over the diffraction term which caused by the relativistic nonlinearity. We can mentioned, for all presentations of beam width parameters as function normalized propagation distance, that the frequency of the oscillations and the amplitude increase with the aperture coefficient, the relative plasma density and the intensity parameter. Fig. 6 shows the dependence of beam intensity distributions with x / r 0 and the normalized propagation distance for different values of modulation parameter: a 0 =0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9. From this figure, it’s shown that the intensity laser beam presents oscillations dues to the oscillatory behavior of beam width along the propagation distance. The number of oscillations increases with the modulation parameter, which explains that the modulation parameter favors self-focusing of the laser beam. Therefore the oscillatory self-focusing mode for finite Airy-Gaussian beam is enhanced than that of the Airy-Gaussian beams. This result confirms the previous discussion. 5 Conclusion In the present investigation, the analytical equation of beam-width parameter for finite Airy-Gaussian beam is derived by using Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin and paraxial approximations. From our numerical results, one can conclude that various parameters affect the behavior of the considered beams family which plays essential role in the self-focusing process, indeed the finite Airy-Gaussian beam becomes focuses stronger and earlier with larger plasma and beam parameters. In additionally, we are deduced the result of Airy-Gaussian beam from our analytical and numerical results as a special case. The comparison between both finite Airy-Gaussian beam and Airy-Gaussian beam are discussed and shows the better oscillatory self-focusing mode for finite Airy-Gaussian beam than Airy-Gaussian beam. It is predicted that the results of the present study are useful in understanding the physics of high power laser driven fusion and clarifying the mechanisms engaged in beam propagation in technological applications and in the laboratory.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.016,Estimating the height of wetland vegetation using airborne discrete-return LiDAR data,"Abstract Several studies have been conducted to estimate wetland vegetation height using airborne LiDAR data. However, no studies have been conducted to explore the influence of vegetation cover on vegetation height estimation models. The objective of this research is to estimate vegetation height in wetlands with varying vegetation cover for further analyzing the effects of vegetation cover. First, we performed both linear and logarithmic regression analyses between field-measured heights and each LiDAR-derived metric in wetlands with different vegetation cover. Then LiDAR-derived metrics were combined through multiple regression analysis to estimate wetland vegetation height. The height estimates were finally validated by leave-one-out cross-validation method. The results showed that the logarithmic regression analysis performed better than the linear regression analysis in estimating wetland vegetation height for almost all LiDAR-derived metrics regardless of vegetation cover. The max height of LiDAR returns (Hmax) provided the best agreement with field-measured heights in wetlands with high vegetation cover. In contrast, the strongest correlation was observed using the standard deviation of LiDAR heights (H SD ) for low vegetation cover. Results of multiple regression analysis indicated that the best model was based on Hmax and 90 percentile height of LiDAR returns (H90) in wetlands with high vegetation cover, while the best model can be expressed as a function of H SD and H90 for low vegetation cover. Therefore, our study concluded that vegetation cover is an important factor of vegetation height models. Additionally, our study will provide valuable guidance for field-measured data collection and vegetation height estimation using LiDAR data.",Feb-18," Keywords Airborne LiDAR Wetland vegetation Vegetation height 1 Introduction Wetland vegetation is a core component of wetland ecosystems and plays an important role in the ecological functions of wetlands. The quantitative description of wetland vegetation structure characteristics is critical for sustainable ecosystem management and preserving biological diversity [1–4]. Vegetation height, one of the most important structural variables, is a key input required by wetland ecosystem models [3,5,6]. Therefore, it is essential to accurately estimate the height of wetland vegetation. Advances in airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have made it a good data source for accurately estimating vegetation canopy height over large areas [7–10]. Over the past decade, many studies have demonstrated the capability of airborne discrete-return LiDAR data for forest height estimation [11–13]. LiDAR-derived metrics, such as the mean and max height of LiDAR normalized returns, have usually been used to estimate forest canopy height [9,14,15]. However, the estimation accuracy of these metrics derived from airborne discrete-return LiDAR data is usually limited in environments with short, dense vegetation for two reasons [16,17]. First, the laser penetration to the ground is greatly affected by dense vegetation, making terrain estimates and thus vegetation height estimates less accurate [18–20]. Second, airborne discrete-return LiDAR data provide limited information about vegetation vertical structure because they only record one return for each emitted pulse in areas with short vegetation [21]. Regardless of these limitations, a list of previous studies has proven that airborne LiDAR is a valuable tool for estimating short vegetation height across a range of vegetation species [14,22–24]. Simultaneously, these studies indicated that vegetation species has a substantial effect on vegetation height estimation models [14,20]. Both LiDAR-derived metrics and types of models varied greatly under environments with different vegetation species. For example, Davenport et al. (2000) indicated that the standard deviation of detrended LiDAR heights is the best predictor of vegetation height for agricultural crops [23], while Hladik, Schalles, and Alber (2013) showed that height metrics are more suitable for estimating vegetation height in salt marsh [25]. Kulawardhana, Popescu, and Feagin (2014) predicted vegetation height using a linear regression analysis in salt marsh environments [17], while Luo et al. (2015) reported that a logarithmic regression analysis performs better than a linear regression analysis in estimating the height of wetland vegetation [26]. Additionally, these studies also showed that vegetation height prediction models may be different even for the same vegetation species [22,25]. This situation may be caused by the different vegetation cover. However, no studies have been conducted to explore the effects of vegetation cover on the estimation models of vegetation height. Therefore, in this paper, we aimed at estimating the vegetation height in wetlands of varying vegetation cover using airborne discrete-return LiDAR data to investigate the influence of vegetation cover on vegetation estimation models. To fulfill this goal, the following three objectives were used: (1) to conduct linear and logarithmic regression analyses of field-measured heights against each LiDAR-derived metric in wetlands with different vegetation cover, (2) to evaluate the combined use of LiDAR-derived metrics for height estimation through multiple regression analysis, (3) to assess the accuracies of wetland vegetation height estimates using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The study area is located in Zhangye City, Gansu Province of northwest China (Fig. 1 ). The terrain of the experiment site is relatively flat, with a mean elevation of 1410m above sea level. The dominant vegetation is reed (Phragmites australis), representing approximately 95% of all wetland vegetation, and there are a few other plant species such as Amorpha fruticosa L., Salix saposhnikovii A. Skv. and Lycium chinese Mill. The vegetation across the study area is short, and the maximum vegetation height is generally less than 2.0m. 2.2 Airborne LiDAR data The airborne discrete-return LiDAR data used in this study were from the “Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER)” project [27] and were collected in July 2012 using a Leica ALS70 system. The nominal flying height was 1300m above the ground level, and the average point density was approximately 6.7points/m2. Raw point clouds were processed to extract LiDAR-derived metrics in this study. Outliers were first eliminated using an elevation frequency histogram method [28].Then, the LiDAR point clouds were classified as canopy and ground returns using the adaptive triangulated irregular network (TIN) filtering algorithm embedded in the TerraScan software [29]. A digital elevation model (DEM) was finally created using ground returns with a grid cell size of 0.5m. Additionally, the accuracy of the DEM was assessed using differential Real-time kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK GPS) points, and the mean error (ME) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the DEM are 0.05m and 0.12m, respectively. Using this DEM, we can remove the influence of topography and obtain DEM-normalized LiDAR point clouds. The LiDAR-derived metrics were calculated based on the DEM normalized LiDAR point clouds. 2.3 Field measurements The field measurements were conducted on July 11–13, 2012. There were a total of 208 sample plots, with a radius of 1m, across the whole study area. Nine representative measurements of vegetation height were randomly collected within each plot, and the mean value of these nine vegetation heights was calculated and referred to as the reference height value of each plot. Table 1 shows the statistics of the measured vegetation height in the field plots. The geographic coordinate of each plot center was measured with high accuracy using a differential RTK GPS. Additionally, only the field plots in areas with homogeneous vegetation were selected to reduce the effect of positioning accuracy on the height estimation. The coordinate system of these plot center coordinates is 47N/WGS-84, corresponding to that of airborne discrete-return LiDAR data. 2.4 Wetland vegetation height estimation and accuracy assessment In this study, a wide range of LiDAR-derived metrics, which have been successfully used for characterizing vegetation height in previous studies, were used to estimate wetland vegetation height [17,30–33]. These metrics included 1) selected height measures, i.e., the percentile height (H75, H80, H90), max height (Hmax) and mean height (H mean ) of the LiDAR returns, and 2) variability of height measures, i.e., the standard deviation (H SD ) and coefficient of variation (H CV ) of the detrended LiDAR heights. These LiDAR-derived metrics were calculated based on DEM-normalized LIDAR point clouds. However, only the results for the best metrics are discussed further in this paper. These metrics for each plot were estimated using the following formulae: (1) H max = max ( h i ) , 1 ≤ i ≤ N (2) H m e a n = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N h i (3) H S D = ∑ i = 1 N ( h i − H m e a n ) 2 N − 1 (4) H C V = H S D H m e a n (5) CC = N c a n o p y N c a n o p y + N g r o u n d where h i is the height of the ith point in the plot, and N, N canopy , and N ground are the total number of LiDAR points, number of canopy points and number of ground points in each plot, respectively. To analyze the influence of the vegetation cover on vegetation height predication models, this study compared different LiDAR-derived metrics and types of models for quantifying vegetation height in wetlands of varying vegetation cover. In detail, both the linear and logarithmic regression analyses between the field-measured heights and each LiDAR-derived metric were conducted. These models were examined in wetlands with high vegetation cover and low vegetation cover, respectively. In this study, low vegetation cover was differentiated from high vegetation cover according to the vegetation cover (CC) calculated from the airborne discrete-return LiDAR data. The CC was calculated as the ratio between the number of vegetation returns and the number of all returns within each plot. Therefore, a height threshold was set as 0.1m to separate vegetation returns from all returns for calculating the CC according to the study of Luo et al. (2015) [26]. In addition, a threshold of the vegetation cover was set as 0.8 to separate low from high vegetation cover in this study. However, this study did not divide all field plots into a high vegetation cover class and a low vegetation cover class. The high vegetation cover class contains all the field plots (CC=0–1.0), and the low vegetation cover class only includes the field plots for which the value of the vegetation cover is less than 0.8 (CC=0–0.8) in this study. Thus, the numbers of plots that belong to high and low vegetation cover classes are 208 and 138, respectively. Furthermore, to evaluate the combined use of LiDAR-derived metrics for the height estimation of wetland vegetation under various vegetation cover, multiple regression analysis was performed using all LiDAR-derived metrics as explanatory variables [34,35]. The procedure of the multiple regression analysis includes three main steps. First, the initial model is fitted using all the LiDAR-derived metrics as selected predictors. Second, the selected predictors with a p-value of greater than 0.05 (p>0.05) were regarded as being not significant and were removed; then, the model was refitted. Finally, the two steps were iterated until all the selected predictors were statistically significant. In this study, the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) were calculated to evaluate the fitness degree of the height estimation models. Additionally, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed to assess the reliability of these models. The LOOCV method is an effective method for evaluating the generalization capability of regression models, being particularly useful for models with a small number of samples [36,37].The root mean square error (RMSECV) from the cross-validation analysis was calculated and adopted as an indicator of the model predictive power [37]. 3 Results The results of both the linear and logarithmic regression analyses between the field-measured heights and each LiDAR-derived metric are listed in Table 2 . From Table 2, due to the higher R2 and lower RMSE values of the logarithmic regression analyses, we can conclude that logarithmic regression analyses perform better in estimating vegetation height than linear regression analyses for almost all LiDAR-derived metrics in wetlands regardless of vegetation cover. Among all the LiDAR-derived metrics, the max height of the LiDAR returns Hmax provided the best agreement with the field-measured heights, as indicated by the highest R2, lowest RMSE and RMSECV (R2 =0.600, RMSE=0.219m, RMSECV =0.221m) in environments with high vegetation cover. The best-constructed model was H=0.580*ln(Hmax)+1.467 (Fig. 2 a). However, the strongest relationship was observed between the standard deviation of the detrended LiDAR height H SD and the field-measured heights in wetlands with low vegetation cover, and the best-constructed model in this environment was H=0.513*ln(H SD )+2.205 (Fig. 2b). This model had the highest R2 and the lowest RMSE and RMSECV (R2 =0.692, RMSE=0.209m, RMSECV =0.212m). Additionally, multiple regression analysis was employed to estimate the height of the wetland vegetation using the LiDAR-derived metrics as explanatory variables. In this study, multiple regression analysis was only conducted for the case of logarithmic transformations because the logarithmic regression analyses perform better in estimating the wetland vegetation height compared to the linear regression analyses. The p-values of all the LiDAR-derived metrics were simultaneously calculated during the multiple regression analysis process (as shown in Fig. 3 ). Only the LiDAR-derived metrics with p-values of less than 0.05 were considered in this study. In this case, the best-constructed model of the multiple regression analysis was built based on Hmax and H80 in wetlands with high vegetation cover; the equation is H=0.336*ln(Hmax)+0.140*ln(H80)+1.522 (Fig. 4 a). However, multiple regression analysis returned H90, H SD , and H CV as the significant variables in the model for low vegetation cover, and the best model is H=0.661*ln(H SD )−0.271*ln(H CV )−0.222*ln(H90)+2.242 (Fig. 4b). To summarize, the results of both the simple regression analysis and multiple regression analysis indicated that the height estimation models are quite different in wetlands with different vegetation cover. Thus, we can conclude that vegetation cover is an important factor of height estimation models. 4 Discussion The results of our study indicated that the logarithmic regression analyses performed better than the linear regression analyses in estimating the height of wetland vegetation for almost all LiDAR metrics regardless of vegetation cover. This is in agreement with many previous studies. Cobby, Mason, and Davenport (2001) showed that a logarithmic regression analysis can better explain the relationship between field crop height with LiDAR-derived metrics [22]. In addition, Luo et al. (2015) indicated that logarithmic regression analysis (R2 value of 0.85 with an RMSE of 0.14m) achieves a higher estimation accuracy than does linear regression analysis (R2 =0.74 and RMSE=0.19m) in estimating wetland vegetation height [26]. This can be mainly explained as the result of the varying degrees of laser pulse penetration into the foliage under different vegetation cover. Although we assume that the laser pulses were returned from the top of the canopy surfaces, the laser pulses were usually returned from inside the canopy. The degree of laser pulse penetration is closely related to the vegetation cover of each plot. For example, in dense vegetation areas, most laser pulses are returned from the top of the canopy surfaces, whereas the laser pulses are returned from inside the canopy in sparse vegetation areas. Given that the vegetation cover varied greatly in our study area, the degree of laser pulse penetration may be different in different plots. For example, the LiDAR-derived metrics present a large difference in two plots with the same vegetation heights but different vegetation cover. In this case, linear regression analysis cannot ideally represent the relationship between the vegetation height and the LiDAR-derived metrics for our experiment site. In this analysis, a range of LiDAR-derived metrics were used for the height estimation of wetland vegetation. The standard deviation of the detrended LiDAR height showed the strongest correlation with the vegetation height in wetland environments with low vegetation cover. H SD represents the variation in the vertical laser point height distribution, which has been proven to be a good predictor for estimating the height of short vegetation in previous studies [17,22,23,26]. More importantly, this metric does not rely on a certain fraction of return pulses hitting the ground, short vegetation usually presents a small standard deviation, and tall vegetation results in larger values. Therefore, H SD was a good choice to estimate short vegetation in wetlands of low vegetation cover in our study. However, our findings revealed Hmax, which is the max height of the LiDAR returns, as the best predictor of the vegetation height in wetland environments with high vegetation cover. This corresponds with the study of Hopkinson et al. (2006) [14]. Their study reported that Hmax is a better indicator of vegetation canopy height over homogeneous vegetation. In addition, Hmax provided the best agreement with field-measured heights in salt marshes, as indicated by Kulawardhana, Popescu, and Feagin (2014) [17]. The high accuracy of the LiDAR-derived DEM in our study may have contributed to the smaller errors in the vegetation height estimates using Hmax. Moreover, almost all laser pulses will reflect from the top of the canopy in dense vegetation areas, thereby limiting the variation in the vertical distribution and thus greatly affecting the height estimation using H SD . Therefore, Hmax is the best LiDAR-derived metric to estimate the wetland vegetation height in environments with dense vegetation cover. Additionally, we found that multiple regression analysis can improve the height estimation accuracy of wetland vegetation regardless of vegetation cover. Additionally, the height estimation models of the multiple regression analysis are different in wetlands with different vegetation cover. To summarize, our study concluded that the vegetation cover is a key factor that greatly affected the height prediction models of wetland vegetation. This conclusion can help to explain the phenomenon whereby height estimation models may be different even for the same vegetation species. More importantly, this study contributes to field-measured data collection and vegetation height estimation using LiDAR data. In future studies, field measurements must be collected at experiment sites with both high and low vegetation cover to build a good height estimation model, which would have wider applicability for predicting vegetation height. 5 Conclusions Airborne discrete-return LiDAR data were used to estimate the short vegetation height in wetlands of varying vegetation cover in this study. The results indicated that logarithmic regression analyses perform better than linear regression analyses in estimating the short vegetation height in wetlands regardless of vegetation cover. The best-constructed model is the logarithmic regression analysis using the max height of the LiDAR returns (Hmax) in environments with high vegetation cover. However, the standard deviation (H SD ) of the detrended LiDAR heights is the best predictor of the short vegetation height in wetland environments with low vegetation cover. Additionally, the combined use of LiDAR-derived metrics in multiple regression analysis can improve the estimation accuracy for wetland vegetation regardless of vegetation cover, and the results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the height estimation models are quite different in wetlands with different vegetation cover. Our study concluded that vegetation cover strongly affects vegetation height estimation models for wetlands. Although the types of models remain unchanged, the LiDAR-derived metrics were different under an environment with different vegetation cover. To summarize, this work contributes to collecting field-measured data and finding a good model for estimating the height of short vegetation, although it has a limitation. The vegetation height estimation in this research was only conducted in wetland of varying vegetation cover. Future works should focus on vegetation height estimation under specific environments with varying vegetation species and vegetation cover.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.011,Influence of Cd on optical and photoluminescence behavior of Zn0.98-xCdxMn0.02S quantum dots under Ar atmosphere,"Abstract In the present study, Zn0.98-xMn0.02CdxS (x=0, 0.02 and 0.04) quantum dots have been successfully synthesized using co-precipitation method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study confirmed substitution of Cd, Mn well in ZnS host with existing cubic structure. The average size of the particles was measured from XRD pattern and it was ∼2nm. The SEM study was taken to reveal the surface morphology of the samples. EDX spectra evidenced the existence of Cd, Mn, Zn and S in the samples as per the targeted stoichiometry. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of peaks which corresponding to molecules present in the samples. UV–visible absorption and transmission spectra were studied and high intensity of absorption was received for the higher composition of Cd. A huge suppression was noticed in transmission peaks during Cd addition. When 2% of Cd added with Mn: ZnS, A small blue shift was identified and got redshift for higher concentration of Cd. Band gap values were tuned from 3.79eV to 3.98eV and discussed based on the quantum confinement effect. From this tailoring of band gap and optical property, these materials shall be selected for optoelectronic device applications. A room temperature photoluminescence study was carried out and sharp as well as strong UV band emissions were observed. Blue and green emission bands were also exhibited by Cd doping. The variations in luminescence intensities were discussed in terms of the crystallite size and defect state formation.",Feb-18," Keywords Cd Mn doped ZnS Co-precipitation method Energy gap Photoluminescence 1 Introduction Fabrication of compound semiconductors from II–VI group is most fascinating one because of its diverse applications. In this trend, people give high priority to the ZnS since it possesses many imperative aspects in structural, luminescence, visible optical properties than the same expressed by ZnO [1]. ZnS is the first semiconductor material and it possesses two structures. ZnS is a wide band gap semiconductor and it can be doped by either by p-type semiconductor or n-type semiconductor. Cubic structure has the band gap of 3.72eV and wurtzite structure has a band gap of 3.77eV [2]. The ZnS material is a suitable material for electronic applications since it offers many optimum roles in Field effect transistors, solar, display and opto-electronic applications. The process of doping with transition metals will yield desired structural, optical and magnetic properties for various industrial applications [3,4]. Better luminescence was observed by Bhargava et al. in Mn doped ZnS [5]. Mn is having attractive optical and photoluminescence properties, Mn doped ZnS find solar cell applications [6]. The Mn composition ratio was confined as 2% because of its excellent optical properties especially better transmittance was observed from the earlier studies [7,8]. The process of Co-doping will help to fine tune the properties of nano particles for the specific selected applications in engineering sector. Doping of Cd divalent impurity (II column element) with ZnS was carried out by several researchers for harvesting the structural, optical, photo catalysis and photoluminescence properties towards solar, imaging and opto-electronic devices applications [9–13]. We can able to find some of the applications of Cd doped ZnS QDs as drug carrier and in bio-labelling process [14]. A unique role of Cd doped ZnS QDs selected for tuning of color emission in LEDs [15]. Some of the work was carried out on the separate preparation of Mn and Cd doped ZnS QDs and analyzed their optical and photoluminescence properties for opto-electronic device applications [16–19]. As the dual doping of Mn and Cd with ZnS was limited Cd was taken as the second doping material. Even though the Mn and Cd were having different ionic sizes, they attract more attention in characterizing better optical and electronic properties of the materials. Synthesis was successfully carried out by the simple co-precipitation method because of its ability for mass production in low cost. In the present work, an investigation was made for the preparation of dual doped ZnS QDs by Cd, Mn. The structural, morphological, optical and photoluminescence properties of Zn 0.98-xMn0.02CdxS QDs (x=0, 2 and 4) were discussed and results were reported. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of Zn0.98-xMn0.02CdxS (x=0, 2 and 4) QDs Co-precipitation method was used to synthesize Zn0.98-x Mn0.02 Cdx S (x=0, 2 and 4) quantum dots in room temperature. Zinc acetate (Zn(CH3 COO)2), Manganese acetate (Mn(CH3COO2·2H2O)), cadmium acetate (Cd (CH3COOH)2·2H2O) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) were used as precursors for the preparation of Cd doped Mn:ZnS QDs. All the chemicals were in analytical grade (Merck, >99%) and hence further purification process was evaded. Ultra- pure de-ionized water was utilized throughout the preparation process. Quantity of (Zn(CH3 COO)2)·2H2O was taken as per the stoichiometry expected ratio and Mn doping percentage was fixed as 2% and Cd doping was varied from 0% to 4%. All the chemicals were weighed using electronic balance and dissolved in distilled water to prepare separate solutions. 0.5M of (Zn (CH3 COO)2)·2H2O dissolved in 50ml de-ionized water and 2% of Manganese acetate, different solutions of (0–4%) Cadmium acetate dissolved in 25ml de-ionized ultra-pure distilled water. Na2S was taken in equal molar amount of (Zn (CH3 COO)2). Each solution was added drop-wise in a common beaker under the continuous magnetic string for 6h. The rotating speed of magnetic stirrer was fixed as 1000rpm. The pH value was standardized at 9.5 using liquid ammonium. Due to the formation of Cd doped Mn:ZnS structure brownish precipitations were received at the end of the process. To get end product, precipitate was taken and washed by distilled water in order to ensure the purity. Finally it was kept in micro-oven for 6h at 65°C. After that the samples were kept in oven for 3h at 100°C under Ar atmosphere to enhance the quality of structural parameters and the nature of adherence. Final compound was powdered properly to get homogeneity in size. This process was repeated for getting Cd=0%, 2% and 4% with Mn (2%): ZnS QDs. 2.2 Experimental characterization techniques The crystal structure of the prepared samples was taken by using powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD). The diffracted patterns were registered by RigaKuC/max-2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.506Å) at 40kV. XRD peaks recorded from 2θ=20° to 70° with scan rate 0.2° per min. Surface morphological studies were taken using SEM, (JEOLJSM 6390). The topology and element’s composition were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) using K and L lines. UV–visible optical absorption spectra were observed to express the optical properties using UV–visible spectrometer (Model: Lambda 5, Make: Perkin Elmer). The spectra due to chemical composition were studied by FTIR spectrometer (Model: Perkin Elmer, Make: spectrum RX I) ranged from 400 to 4000cm−1. The KBr at 1wt% mixed with samples to make pellets for the FTIR measurement. The photoluminescence studies were analyzed using PL measurement (Hitachi, F-2500) at excitation energy of 325nm wavelength to study the radiative recombination properties. All the experimental studies were taken at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural study (XRD) X-Ray Diffraction patterns are used to study the structure of the crystalline material, size, phase and inter planar distance. This is also used to provide information of the unit cell parameters. From Fig. 1 , It was clearly observed that all the three samples had well defined major peaks corresponding to (111) (220) (311) without formation of secondary peaks. These results confirmed the cubic structure of Mn+Cd+ZnS QDs with different composition of Cd (0%, 2% and 4%). Joint committee of powder diffraction standards value (JCPDS card No. 80-0020) supported the peaks received for cubic structure. Owing to the incorporation of Cd2+ ion in the Mn doped ZnS QDs, the original structure of ZnS was not disturbed and 2θ value pertaining to primary peak shifted towards higher angle side for 4% doping of Cd and it was returned to lower angle side slowly for 2% addition of Cd. This movement of 2θ values was ascribed to the change in particle size. Peak intensity was gradually increased for the every increase of Cd composition rate. When Cd2+ (0.78Å) ion was compared with Mn2+ (0.80Å) and Zn2+ (0.78Å) ions Cd2+ ion possess larger ionic radius. Due to this parameter the obtained crystallite size was increased lightly [19]. This evidenced the substitution of Cd2+ ion into Mn:ZnS host lattice. Devadoss et al. reported similar increase of crystallite size due to the addition of Cd composition into ZnS QDs [9]. Average crystallite size of all the three samples was determined by using Debye – Scherrer’s formula [20]. (1) A v e r a g e c r y s t a l l i n e s i z e ( D ) = 0.9 λ β cos θ Where, λ is the wavelength of X-ray used (1.5406Å), β denotes the full width at half maximum along primary axes (111) and θ indicates the Bragg’s diffraction angle. Micro-strain of the crystal structure was determined by using the formula given below [21]. (2) M i c r o - s t r a i n ( ε ) = β cos θ 4 Where, β is the full width at half maximum value of XRD primary peak and θ is Bragg’s diffraction angle. Micro strain value was slightly increased for 2% addition of Cd and got reduced for further rise of Cd doping. Lattice parameters were slightly varied for every incorporation of Cd with Mn:ZnS. The crystal parameters like lattice constant, FWHM value, crystallite size, inter-planar distance and micro-strain were listed in Table 1 . 3.2 Morphological analysis (SEM) SEM plays an effective role on the study of surface morphology by fetching actual information concerning the process behind in the growth of the structure, size and shape of crystalline material. Fig. 2 a–c revealed the SEM picture of Mn:ZnS and Cd doped M:ZnS QDs. The small size spherical shaped particles were identified in Fig. 2a. It confirmed the Mn doping into ZnS host. When Cd was introduced in the composition, a large aggregation of small particles was received and agglomeration was started slowly. Cd2+ ion replaced Zn2+ ion from the ZnS layout and small particles are mainly migrated from the inner portion to surface, and hence agglomeration was received at higher degree after doping with Cd. For the higher composition of Cd produced a highly agglomerated particles and which was shown in Fig. 2c. undoped Mn:ZnS, the compositional analysis is given below. 3.3 Elemental analysis (EDX) The EDS spectrum is an essential tool to explore the chemical composition present in the sample. The EDS spectra of Zn0.98-x Mn0.02 Cdx S (x=0, 0.02 and 0.04) quantum dots were shown in Fig. 3 a–c. The results obtained from the EDX analysis, confirmed the presence of Zn, Mn, Cr and S in samples as per the target ratio. The well-defined peaks related to the elements identified at equivalent energy values. The Cd atomic percentage was increased as 0%, 1.21% and 2.28% corresponding to 0%, 2% and 4% addition of Cd into Mn:ZnS QDs. The composition rate of Zn decreased gradually as the function of Cd incorporation and this proven that the replacement of Zn was done by Cd during doping. No other elements were traced and purity was evidenced. The derived elemental compositions are nearly equal to their stoichiometric ratios. Small fractional deviation may be occurred due to the experimental error. 3.4 UV–visible optical studies The tailoring of optical bandgap and absorption behavior of material will play a vital role for the utilization of opto-electronic device applications. Optical absorption and transmittance phenomena usually expressed the optical nature of the samples. Fig. 4 illustrates the UV–visible absorption behavior of Cd doped Mn:ZnS QDs within the range of 300nm to 600nm at room temperature. The intensity of absorption was increased around double time for 4% composition of Cd. The absorption intensity was enhanced as the function of Cd incorporation. The reason may be due to agglomeration of the particles and size growing effect. The inset picture depicts the variation in wavelength (red shift) and peak intensities clearly. The role of Cd was the high absorption of energy in UV region and their atoms got transition from lower energy state to higher energy state. From the room temperature transmittance study, it was observed that the transmittance got highly suppressed as the function of Cd doping. Mn doping into ZnS caused better transmittance and Cd incorporation diminished the transmittance intensity gradually. All the transmittance peaks have sharp increase in UV band due to their inter-band transitions from valence band to conduction band transitions. Fig. 5 shows the variation of transmittance of three samples within the range of 300nm to 600nm. The optical bandgap is the energy difference between the top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band. By varying the size of the QDs the tailoring of band gap is possible and it leads optimum outcome for band gap engineering. The band gap of cd doped Mn:ZnS was calculated by using the Tauc’s relation which relates absorption coefficient (α) and the incident photon energy (hν) of semiconductors as given below [22]. (3) α h ν = A ( h ν − E g ) n Where, A is a constant, Eg is an optical band gap of the semiconductor and the exponent value n denotes the type of transition. n=½ for direct allowed, n=2 for indirect allowed and n=3/2 for direct forbidden transition. The band gap of the prepared samples obtained by making a plot between energy (hν) and (αhν)2, extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption edge as shown in Fig. 6 . Through doping, we can tune the bandgap of semiconductor for wide range based on the material composition and the size of the particles which appropriate for application orient. By increasing the Cd from 0% to 2% the bandgap was slightly blue shifted (from 3.92eV to 3.97eV). The reason for the blue shift was ascribed to quantum confinement effect since the size of the particle was reduced for this (2%) addition of Cd into Mn:ZnS. The similar blue shift in band gap was observed by Virpal et al. [23]. Band gap value was received a red shift (3.79eV) for further addition of Cd (4%). The valence and conduction bands of CdS are existed in the energy level of ZnS itself. Hence electron – hole pairs tried to appear with CdS which leads decrement in the energy levels [12,24]. This may also be due to direct energy transfer between semiconductor- excited states and 3d levels of Mn2+ and 4d shells of Cd2+. It supported the size increment concept of samples. All the samples exhibited the band gap larger than the bulk form (3.6eV) of ZnS is due to quantum confinement effect. 3.5 FTIR studies The room temperature FTIR spectra of Zn0.98-x Mn0.02 Cdx S (x=0, 0.02 and 0.04) quantum dots were taken from 400cm−1 to 4000cm−1 as shown in Fig. 5a. The strong absorption peaks observed from 3300cm−1 to 3500cm−1 were attributed to OH stretching vibrations of water molecule since chemicals were dissolved in distilled water earlier [25]. Vibrations due to CO2 stretching were identified near 2300cm−1 [26]. The relaxed peaks with higher transmittance intensity were received after CO2 vibrations. The bands noticed around 1500cm−1 were ascribed to HOH molecule bending vibrations in the samples [27]. The peaks appeared near 1400cm−1 were endorsed to CO stretching vibrations [28]. The extended FTIR spectra of Zn0.98-x Mn0.02 Cdx S (x=0, 2 and 4) quantum dots from 400cm−1 to 1000cm−1 were shown in Fig. 5b for the sake of clear visibility of microstructure formation. The sharp peaks located near 832cm−1 and 932cm−1 were due to Cd addition with Mn: ZnS QDs. Strong absorption bands at 618cm−1 and 671cm−1 were appeared because of the Mn and Cd incorporation into ZnS lattice [29]. Weak bands around 705cm−1 and 740cm−1 were appeared only in the IR spectra corresponding to Cd doping. Small and distinct shifts in intensity as well as wave number were owing to the addition of Cd and they were ranged from 400cm−1 to 1000cm−1. 3.6 Photoluminescence studies Photoluminescence study is an important tool to examine the light emitting property of the materials. We have taken room temperature PL study for Cd doped Mn:ZnS QDs. The PL spectra of the three samples were shown in Fig. 6a. Here the intensity of Mn doped ZnS was gradually decreased and a sharp increase was observed around 392nm. This UV emission peak evidenced a strong PL emission of the Mn doped ZnS in UV region. An incorporation of Cd produced a sudden and distinct peak in the UV region. All the peaks corresponding to Cd doped samples were blue shifted and their values were 389nm and 390nm. This shift in wavelength and peak intensity confirmed the presence of Cd2+ ions in the Mn:ZnS QDs. This UV band emission near 390nm in ZnS can be ascribed to recombination process between the Sulphur vacancy related donor and Zinc vacancy related acceptor levels [30]. The PL spectra of Cd doped Mn:ZnS QDS were shown in Fig. 6b. Here the wavelength was ranged from 450nm to 600nm (visible range). In this section two strong peaks were observed corresponding to blue emission (≈480nm) and green emission (≈520nm). For higher percentage of Cd doping, the green emission got red shift. This green and blue emission clearly evidenced the formation of Zn0.98-x Mn0.02 Cdx S (x=0, 2 and 4) QDs. The transition from extended Cdi band to valence band is responsible or the blue emission [31]. The strong green emission peaks were due to the recombination of surface states. This involved the recombination phenomena of electrons trapped inside a Sulphur vacancy with a hole existing in valence band of CdS [32]. The Fig. 6c shows the band diagram for PL emission. A transition from Vs to De provides blue emission near 480nm, Due to radiative transition between E and De was ascribed to green emission near 520nm and transition from 4T1 to 6A1 was attributed to increase in PL intensity near yellow emission. These results were evidenced by Mall et al. [19]. 4 Conclusions Zn0.98-xMn0.02CdxS (x=0, 2 and 4) QDs were successfully synthesized by coprecipitation method. All the samples were exhibited cubic structure without formation of secondary phase which was evidenced from XRD results. Crystallite size was increased for higher doping concentration of Cd. SEM results confirmed the presence of Cd on the surface of Mn doped ZnS QDs. EDX analysis report confirmed the presence of Zn, Mn, Cd and S elements in samples as per the expected ratio. A strong absorption was observed for the higher composition of Cd doping and lower transmittance was noticed for higher percentage of Cd addition. This material shall be selected for solar and opto-electronic device applications. Band gaps were tuned with wide range from 3.79eV to 3.98eV. FTIR spectra evidenced the presence of doped chemicals as per stoichiometry ratio. A strong UV emission was exhibited and firm blue and green emissions were traced from the PL study and it was discussed based on transition of electrons between states. These materials shall be selected for imaging applications also. ", [1] G. Wang B. Huang Z. Li Z. Lou Z. Wang Y. Dai M.-H. Whangbo Sci. Rep. 5 2015 8544 [2] X. Feng T. Zhai U.K. Gautam L. Li L. Wu Y.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.036,An alternate method to extract performance characteristics in dye sensitized solar cells,"Abstract Modeling the electrical properties of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) can fill the gap between the experimental and ideal performance observations for a reliable device diagnosis, design and optimization. The complex physical and chemical reactions between nanocrystalline semiconductor, electrolyte ions and dye molecules make their simulation an open issue to the researchers. Compared to the research works presented in literature, here, we provide a simpler, but more meaningful fit of current −voltage curves by developing a simulation model. The present work provides a reliable framework to extract electrical transport properties of the device, namely, diffusion coefficient, transport time, diffusion length, series resistance and performance parameters from steady state current–voltage curves without using interpretable frequency dependent methods, as well as transient characteristics. The model versatility makes it also capable of predicting the dye regeneration efficiency under short circuit, mid-voltages and high voltage ranges. The simulation method can be also implemented to compare the effect of different electrolytes as well as their species concentrations on regeneration efficiency and overall DSSCs performance. The whole model is designed in a flexible framework to be adapted to various kind of solar cells such as quantum dot and perovskite solar cells.",Feb-18," Keywords Dye-sensitized solar cell Current–voltage characteristics Dye regeneration Electrical properties 1 Introduction Solar cell technology has been vigorously tracking the dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) research findings due to their low cost production, easy fabrication and high efficiency from the time they were first introduced [1]. Meanwhile, several dyes as sensitizers [2–5], nanocrystalline metal oxide semiconductors namely, TiO 2, ZnO and etc. as electron transport medium [6,7] and electrolyte material as dye regenerator have been investigated [8,9]. In practice, the incident photon excites the dye molecules, followed by injection of an electron into the conduction band (C . B) of the nanocrystalline metal oxide semiconductor, and then the electron is diffused towards transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer experiencing trapping/detrapping phenomena. At the same time, the oxidized electrolyte species are reduced by counter electrode (TCO/Pt) after regenerating the oxidized dye molecule. This cycle continues as long as the cell is under illumination. Optimization strategies concerning electron transport, recombination of electrons in C.B with electrolyte ions and oxidized dye molecules have been extensively investigated in literature. As one of the most basic works, Södergen et al. [10] assumed diffusive current to model the J − V characteristics of nanoporous semiconductor films in DSSC neglecting electrolyte species transport. Papageorgiou et al. [11] investigated the transport of electrolyte ions to clarify its impact on the performance of the DSSC. Ferber et al. [12] extended an electrical model including drift-diffusion equations in a system of pseudo-homogeneous TiO 2 layer intermixed with electrolyte active layer to study the internal cell properties. Bisquert et al. [13] presented a comprehensive model-based analysis to connect the different trap distribution regimes in semiconductor band gap to recombination processes in DSSCs. Salehi et al. [14] developed a model to show the improved performance of DSSC by employing flexible substrate. In other similar works, the effect of blocking layer application in DSSC [15] and dynamic doping by using heterointerface layers are discussed [16]. Anta et al. [17,18] developed a single carrier- based model to extract the transport characteristics of the DSSC. Nevertheless, a lack of realistic methodology incorporating the minimum experimental data and simulation- based interpretation under steady and transient state, for device diagnosis and optimum design can be still felt. Previous works by the authors [15,19] introduced a semi-empirical methodology by developing an integrated modeling method to investigate transport properties in DSSC. In the present work, this model is further extended to verify its applicability to investigate, the crucial factors such as (i) shape of the current–voltage curve, (ii) transport properties (lifetime, transport time and diffusion length), and (iii) applied voltage dependent behavior of dye regeneration efficiency ( η r e g ) which controls the electron injection from dye lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to semiconductor conduction band. The model is also fitted to experimental photocurrent and voltage transient responses for providing both steady state and transient interpretations. The proposed modeling strategy enables us to determine the capacitance characteristics and transport properties as well as underlying factors controlling the DSSC performance with minimum experimental workload. 2 Experimental 2.1 Fabrication of DSSCs The TiO 2 paste was prepared as reported by Ito et al. [20]. Briefly, 6g of commercial TiO 2 (average size ∼25nm, P25 Degussa) nanoprticles was ground in mortar and with 20ml DI water, 3ml of ethanol, 1ml acetic acid, 3g of ethyl cellulose and, finally 6g of terpinoel was added, to the mixture and stirred for 30min. In order to make a slurry TiO 2 paste, rotary evaporator was used to remove the solvents. To prepare the DSSC working electrodes, the Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses (Solaronix) at first cleaned in a diluted hydrochloric acid, detergent solution, acetone, and methanol using an ultrasonic bath and then rinsed by deionized water. After treatment in 40mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70°C for 30min, the FTO glass was again washed with water and methanol. The TiO 2 paste was deposited on the substrate by doctor blading. Active area thicknesses were controlled by adhesive tape and to repeat the deposition the number of tapes was increased. After each coating, the cells were left horizontal to relax in clean box and dried at 125°C in air. Finally, all cells were sintered at 500°C in a programmable furnace to make the films porous. The TiO 2 films were again treated with 40mM TiCl4 solution, as previously described, then rinsed with water and methanol and heated at 450°C for 15min and 500°C for 15min. The electrodes were immersed into a 0.4mM N-719 dye ((ruthenium (2, 2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxilate)2(NCS)2, Dyesol, Australia) solution in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio: 1:1) and kept at room temperature for 24h to complete dye loading. Pre-holed FTO glasses were cleaned and Pt catalyst was deposited on the them by spincoating applying a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2mg Pt in 1ml 2-propanol) and repeating the heat treatment at 500°C for 15min. The dye-covered TiO 2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt 25μm thick thermoplastic sealing film made of Surlyn (SX-1170-25, Solaronix). The electrolyte was prepared by a solution 0.60M PMII, 0.03M I2, 0.10M LiI and 0.50M 4-tert- butylpyridine(TBD) in the mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio: 75:25) was introduced into the holes in the back of the counter electrode. 2.2 Electrical measurements The current–voltage (J − V) characteristics were measured using Linear Sweep Voltammetry mode of potantiostat (Em Stat2, PalmSens BV, Netherlands) and solar simulator (Prova, Taiwan). The illumination intensity was adjusted using a built-in Si solar cell to AM1.5. Incident light intensity and active cell area were 100mWcm−2 (1 sun) and 0.25cm−2, respectively. The open circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) was measured by switching off the light source at steady state. The short circuit photocurrent versus time was measured by switching on and off the light source at steady state. 3 Simulation model The simulation model considers steady state and transient transport characteristics of electrons (e), iodide (I −) and tri-iodide ( I 3 − ) in porous photoanode film in one dimension. Fig. 1 plots the relationship between the various processes considered in the model. Firstly, the dynamic equations controlling each particle are established, then their density profiles are calculated considering proper initial and boundary conditions and finally, current density is calculated at each applied voltage from zero to V oc . The main driving force for collecting electrons results from electron density gradient in the vicinity of x =0, ie the diffusive current has the only significant role in electron transport. The contribution of drift in electron and ion transport is neglected because of a short Debye length the electrical field is not significant [20,21]. Fig. 2 depicts the computational algorithm to reproduce the J − V curve fitting. 3.1 Electronic transport The transport model is based on well-known concepts; (i) quasi-Fermi level (QFL) which states that when a semiconductor is illuminated, electrons are injected into the C.B, raising the Fermi level and establishing density gradient. (ii) multi-trap model (MTM) in which the electron transport is assumed to happen via extended states E c and is slowed down by trapping and detrapping of electrons to and from localized trap centers. The result of this model is an effective diffusion coefficient and recombination constant that are electron density dependent (Fig. 1). (iii) is the quasi static approximation (QSA) which assumes that the trapping and detrapping processes are much faster than the transport and recombination processes [22]. The continuity equation for electrons in the photoanode is (1) ∂ n ( x , t ) ∂ t = ( 1 + D ( n ) D 0 ) − 1 ( Γ ξ 2 ∂ ∂ x D ( n ) ∂ n ( x , t ) ∂ x + ( G e ( x , λ ) − R e ( x , t ) ) ( 1 − Θ ) + d n t c o d x ) with (2) D ( n ) = D 0 ∂ n c ∂ n t where D 0 is the diffusion coefficient and n, n t and n c are total, trapped and free electron densities, repectively. Θ is the porosity of the TiO 2 film, Γ and ξ are constrictivity and tortuosity, respectively [23]. Γ can narrow the carriers pathway and ξmakes them pass through a more indirect route. G e ( x , λ ) and R e ( x , t ) are the electron generation and recombination terms, respectively. The derivation of Eq. (1) is given in Appendix A. n tco is the electrons density profile that contribute to FTO/electrolyte recombination. The last term on the right hand side of Eq. (1), is the recombination current from TCO to the electrolyte which can be calculated from Butler-Volmer equation (3) J t c o = J t c o 0 { e x p [ − ( 1 − σ ) e V K b T ] − e x p [ σ e V K b T ] } where J tco0 and σ are the exchange current density and cathodic electron transfer. e is the electron charge, Kb is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and V is the applied bias. It describes how the electrical current on an electrode depends on the electrode potential, considering that both a cathodic and an anodic reaction occur on the same electrode. It should be emphasized here that Eq. (3) is only valid in this simple form if the current is really kinetically controlled, i.e. if diffusion of the redox species toward the electrode surface is sufficiently fast [24]. However, by TiCl 4 treatment of the substrates, this term can be neglected. 3.2 Iodide and tri-iodide transport By assuming the reaction processes in a typical DSSC, the generation of two electrons always gives the generation of one tri-iodide ion and the loss of three iodide ions i.e.: (4) 1 2 ( G e ( x , λ ) − R e ( x , t ) ) = ( G t r i ( x , λ ) − R t r i ( x , λ ) ) = − 1 3 ( G i ( x , λ ) − R i ( x , λ ) ) where G i ( x , λ ) , G t r i ( x , λ ) , R i ( x , λ ) , R t r i ( x , λ ) are the iodide and tri-iodide generation and recombination rates, respectively. Therefore the corresponding dynamic continuity equations for the iodide, n i ( x , t ) , and tri-iodide, n t r i ( x , t ) , in electrolyte becomes (5) ∂ n i ( x , t ) ∂ t = Γ ξ 2 D i ∂ 2 n i ( x , t ) ∂ x 2 − 3 2 Θ e d ( G e ( x , λ ) − R e ( x , t ) ) (6) ∂ n t r i ( x , t ) ∂ t = Γ ξ 2 D t r i ∂ 2 n t r i ( x , t ) ∂ x 2 + 1 2 Θ e d ( G e ( x , λ ) − R e ( x , t ) ) where D i and D tri are the iodide and tri-iodide diffusion coefficients of the photoanode. Θ ed is the porosity available for the electrolyte when dye molecules are adsorbed to the surface of nanoparticles [14]. 3.3 Dye cations For dye cations we can write (7) ∂ [ D + ] ( x , t ) ∂ t = G e ( x , λ ) − k 1 ( n c ( x , t ) − n 0 ) γ [ D + ] ( x , t ) − k 2 n i δ ( x , t ) [ D + ] ( x , t ) where k1 is the electron recombination with dye cations, [ D + ] ( x , t ) is density of cation dyes and k 2 is the dye regeneratin rate. δ is the reaction order in iodide density. γ is the nonlinearity factor in reaction between electrons in TiO 2 C.B and dye cations. Under steady state, ∂ [ D + ] ( x , t ) ∂ t = 0 and iodide density is constant under homogenous conditions, so we can write (8) [ D + ] ( x ) = G e ( x , λ ) k 1 ( n c ( x ) − n 0 ) γ − k 2 ( n i ) δ The regeneration efficiency can be defined as the ratio of regeneration rate of dye cations to the total addition of regeneration rate of dye cations and recombination rate of electrons and dye cations i.e. (9) η r e g = k 2 n i δ [ D + ] ( x , t ) k 1 ( n c ( x ) − n 0 ) γ + k 2 ( n i ) δ 3.4 Initial & boundary conditions The set of time dependent partial differential equations, Eqs. (1) (5) and (6) can be solved simultaneously by applying proper initial and boundary conditions for the carriers as follows 3.4.1 Electron (10a) n ( 0 , t ) = n ( x , 0 ) = n 0 e x p ( α e V K b T ) (10b) d n ( d , t ) d x = 0 α is the depth of traps with respect to the conduction band edge. The first boundary condition states that the initial electron density at the beginning of photoanode, where thickness d =0, is assumed voltage- dependent and the second assures zero current density at the end of photoanode. For electrolyte species we have 3.4.2 Iodide (11a) ∂ n i ( 0 , t ) ∂ x = − 3 2 J t c o e D i (11b) ∫ 0 d n i ( x , t ) d x = n i 0 Θ d (11c) n i ( x , 0 ) = n i 0 3.4.3 Tri-iodide (12a) ∂ n t r i ( 0 , t ) ∂ x = 1 2 J t c o e D t r i (12b) ∫ 0 d n t r i ( x , t ) d x = n t r i 0 Θ d (12c) n t r i ( x , 0 ) = n t r i 0 The first two boundary conditions in Eqs. (11a) and (12a) show that the electrolyte ions current at the beginning of photoanode is associated with the TCO/electrolyte back transfer. The second boundary conditions (Eqs. (11b) and (12b)) assure ions conservation through the photoanode thickness. Finally, by determining the electron density, the diffusion current is calculated at x =0 for different applied voltages by (13) J ( x , t ) = e D ( n ) d n ( x , t ) d x The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell is determined by (14) η = P M P P i n where P MP = V OC J SC FF, FF ( = V M P J M P / V o c J s c ) and P in are fill factor and input power, respectively. The set of partial differential equations (Eqs. (1) (5) and (6)) are solved by applying the Method of Lines and spatial discretization of 100 points in Mathematica 9 medium. 3.5 Transient voltage response, electron lifetime and chemical capacitance Transient LASER spectroscopy is capable of directly giving the density of injected electrons [25]. An alternative way is to analyze the transient current and/or voltage arising from a changing light or voltage impulse. The main amplitude methods are electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [26,27], intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) [28] and stepped light-induced transient measurement [29]. The lifetime from EIS is so to say “a voltage-dependent time constant,” which needs extra interpretation in order to obtain a reliable lifetime. Under OC condition, the injected electrons recombine with I 3 − ions. The OCVD technique has certain advantages over frequency or steady state based methods. The first is that this technique provides a continuous reading of the lifetime as a function of V oc at high-voltage resolution, the second is that being experimentally much simpler, and finally the data treatment is outstandingly simple. In the following, we present an analytical relation for interpretation of experimental OCVD data assuming a nonlinear recombination process to estimate the carrier’s lifetime. Walker et al. [30] showed that the OCVD should display a ln ( t ) dependence at longer times if recombination involves C.B electrons that are detrapped from an exponential distribution of trapping states and a quasi-static state is maintained between free and trapped electrons. Under OCVD condition, in the absence of diffusion and generation terms the continuity equation for electron density profile becomes (15) ( ∂ n c ∂ n t + 1 ) ∂ n t ∂ t = ( 1 − Θ ) − 1 k ( n ( t ) − n 0 ) β k here is the recombination rate and β is the nonlinearity parameter in recombination. Assuming that ∂ n c ∂ n t ≈ n c n t ≪ 1 and inserting the Boltzmann apporximation into Eq. (15) under open circuit (OC) voltage, we arrive at (16) d V o c ( t ) d t = ( ( 1 − Θ ) α e K b T ) − 1 k n 0 β − 1 [ e x p [ ( β − 1 ) α e V o c ( t ) K b T ] − 1 n 0 e x p [ α e V o c ( t ) K b T ] ] The last term on the right is negligible and by integration we obtain (17) V o c ( t ) = − ( α e ( 1 − β ) ( 1 − Θ ) ) − 1 K b T ln [ α k ( 1 − β ) n 0 β − 1 t ] By inserting the modeled V oc from Eq. (17) into Boltzmannn approximation the total electron density profile is calculated which enables us to find the carrier lifetime τ by a simple relation derived from Eqs. (15) and (17), (18) τ = − ( n ( t ) − n 0 ) β ( 1 − Θ ) − 1 ( ∂ n ∂ t ) − 1 The change of electron density under a small variation of the Fermi level is described by the chemical capacitance, [31] which takes the following form (19) C = e 2 ∂ ( n c + n t ) ∂ E f The chemical capacitance is a very crucial concept for solar cell development, since it adequately describes the splitting of Fermi levels caused by excitation of carriers in the light absorbing material [32]. In experiment, by EIS measurement under different voltages one can obtain C which can be used to measure the C.B shifts in the presence of different electrolytes. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Steady state and transient current- voltage characteristics analysis and transport parameters extraction Fig. 3 c shows the spatial dependent behavior of electron density profile under short circuit condition throughout the photoactive layer for all DSSCs labeled as D1, D2, D3 and D4 with different thicknesses. The measured J-V data of D2 and D4 with thickness of about 15.7 and 24 μm (Figs. 3a and b) are also shown with model-fitted curves in Fig. 4 a for model evaluation. The simulated curves of 2 more devices, D1 with 10μm and D3 with 20μm thicknesses, are also included in Fig. 4a. At each spatial point, the electron density profile increases with time and reaches its steady state value. The electron density increases by reaching deeper into the photoanode. It is clearly seen that the electron density gradient is much larger at points close to x =0, resulting in higher diffusive current of electrons. It means that the first micrometers of photoanode mainly contributes to total current density. The trap parameter and diffusion coefficient are adjusted to obtain the best J − V curves fits for all cells under short circuit condition. The electron density profile for D3 gives the largest values by choosing α=0.35 and D 0 =2.2×10−4 cm2s−1 to obtain the best fit and a convergent current density for the voltages within the zero to V OC . The fitted values of diffusion coefficient for DSSCs D1, D2 and D4 are 1.3×10−4, 1.3×10−4 and 1.2×10−4 cm2s−1, respectively, and the continuity equation produces convergent values for current density values within the open circuit voltage by inserting α=0.29. The larger trap parameter means more effective contribution of shallower surface traps with respect to C.B edge [17]. The dependence of diffusion coefficient on thickness arises from the change in trap densities. At a same light intensity, electrons undergo more trapping/detrapping process in thicker films, so the charge transport rate is faster. The dependence of diffusion coefficient on light intensity arises from the change in trap occupancy with intensity. At low light intensity, electrons are exchanged between deep traps and the C.B, and the transport rate is slowed down. At high illumination intensities, deep traps are filled, and electron trapping/detrapping involves shallower levels, so that the electron experiences a faster transport rate [33]. The simulated J − V curves for D1 and D3 and measured J − V curves with their fitted curves for D2 and D4 with various photoanode thicknesses under 1 Sun illumination intensity are plotted in Fig. 4a. The experimental and simulated results are in good agreement for D2 and D4. As can be noticed, no specific behavior is observed from film thickness dependence behavior of open circuit voltages. The values of V oc strongly depends on the input values of k R (recombination rate defined in equation A1.16). Best fits to experimental J − V curves return the values of 5.5×10−10 and3×10−9s−1 for k R for C1 and C3, respectively, and 3×10−9s−1 for D2 and D4. These values are similar to pervious reports [55,43]. The V OC decrease means that the CB edge of TiO 2 shifts positively. The positive shift with respect to dye energy narrows the energy difference between TiO 2 and the dye which allows lower excited states of the dye to inject electrons, leading to a rise in short circuit current [34]. The decrease in V oc by varying the thickness can be associated to back electron transfer to tri-iodide ions. Increasing the surface area of the electrode as a result of increasing film thickness leads to an increase in surface trapping states which can cause back electron transfer. On the other hand, J SC increases by increasing the active layer thickness and suddenly experiences a drop for D4 with thickness of 23μm. The J SC increase is a result of incident photon to current efficiency ( I P C E ) improvement implying uniform charge generation throughout the film [35]. In addition, the improvement of J SC is related to the increase in injecton current from the excited dyes to the C.B of TiO 2 arising from the increased surface area and more dye adsorption. For D4 an additional simulated curve (Fig. 4a, red circle) is plotted which is the result of zero series resistance (R s =0). Considering a fitted value of R s =17Ωcm 2 to the experimental data of J − V curves for D2 and D4 by application of the relation V Exp = V ideal − J ideal R s A, one can easily reproduce the DSSCs final J − V curves (Table 1 ). Thicker films give a higher total amount of traps and hence a larger fraction of electrons being trapped/detrapped, and a longer time for the electron transport gives a larger probability for the electron to be lost to the electrolyte. The experimental values of current densities for D1 and D3 at low voltages (<200mV.) show a nonideal behavior which might be related to low charge-collection efficiency or even low dye regeneration efficiency [36]. Table 2 shows the calculated and fitted transport and performance parameters of the DSSCs with various active layer thicknesses. Fig. 4b plots the PCE of the cells with different photoanode thicknesses under different illumination intensities. Optimum film thickness of about 20μm was also reported in other works [37–40]. However, optimum thickness of 14μm can be found in literature as well [41]. The J SC enhancement with increasing thickness is a direct consequence of the IPCE improvement [42]. Since the J − V curves of the studied DSSCs show a quiet significant difference around short circuit voltages, the investigation of the electrolyte density profiles seems to be useful. Figs. 3c show the spatial dependence behavior of I − / I 3 − density profiles under short circuit condition. As expected, under short circuit condition the I −density decreases at points close tox =0 and increases at points closer to the counter electrode where they are mainly generated. The I 3 − density increases in the vicinity of the working electrode and decreases towards counter electrode due to recombining with electrons. Under short circuit condition the gradient of I 3 − density profile increases at points closer to x =0. As one can see, the I 3 − density increases by electron concentration increase for thicker films. It can be concluded that deeper traps in D4 leads to lesser electron and I 3 − densities. On the other hand, higher electron density, by increasing the film thickness, means more oxidized dye molecules to regenerate which brings about lesser I −density along the photoanode layer. 4.2 Diffusion length estimation with relevance to photoanode thickness, applied bias and illumination side Electron diffusion length (L) is the average distance an electron can move from the point of generation until it recombines. Determining Lin DSSCs has been the subject of some recent studies [19,43,44]. L is calculated by assuming the relation L = ( D ( n ) / k ( n ) ) 1 / 2 . In experiment the transport and interfacial transfer of electrons in dye-sensitized solar cells are measured using intensity modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). IMPS provides information about the dynamics of charge transport and back reaction under SC conditions, whereas the IMVS response is determined by the electron lifetime under OC conditions [45]. Interpretation of the behavior of the diffusion length is ambiguous from a fundamental point of view. The result of our calculations indicates that L shows a weak dependence on light intensity due to the compensation for the decrease in the carrier life time and the increase in diffusion length [46]. The result of calculations for the thickness dependence of L under SC is shown in Fig. 5 a. Higher values of L for thicknesses less than d=20μm are obtained. For thicker films, the electron diffusion is more difficult and large number of photogenerated electrons recombine without reaching the front electrode leading to a decrease in L. Fig. 5b shows the variation of L throughout the film under SC, the maximum power point (MPP) and OC for both working electrode (WE) and counter electrode (CE) side illumination. Under OC, the diffusion lengths for both illumination sides, which almost overlap, are higher than L values for SC and MP conditions throughout the photoanode. The values of L is much higher compared to photoanode thicknesses which indicates a collection efficiency of 100% for all DSSCs. This important result is also reported previously [19,43,55]. 4.3 Photocurrent and photovoltage transient response The model is capable of easily reproducing the transient photocurrent response of DSSCs for investigation of traps distribution. Figs. 6 a and b show the measured and simulated fit of photocurrent transient response for D2 and D4 under illumination and dark. Under illumination, a proper fit is resulted by using the α values extracted from J − V curve fittings. The fit is obtained by using Eq. (13) at x =0 by varyingα. The model is fitted to D2 and D4 photocurrent rise, under illumination, by α values of 0.3 and 0.29, respecticely. Under dark, the transport times (τ tr ) are obtained by fitting the experimental data to the Exp(-t/τ tr ). At short circuit and for homogeneously absorbed light, the electron diffusion coefficient can be estimated from the relation D 0 = d 2/2.35τ tr , where d is the layer thickness of the active layer. The calculated τ tr for D1, D2, D3 and D4 are 2.6, 8, 9 and 19ms. The transport parameters are summarized in Table 2. Thicker films give a higher total amount of traps and hence a larger fraction of electrons being trapped/detrapped, and a longer time for the electron transport gives a larger probability for the electrons to be lost to the electrolyte. In experiment, IMPS measurements or dark current decay are used to estimate the electron transport time. τ tr is influenced by the total number of surface states in the film, the position of the Fermi level, and the electrical connectivity of the nanoparticle network [28]. 4.3.1 Voltage transient behavior, lifetime and chemical capacitance The model fitting results and measured OCVD of D2 and D4 vs time are plotted in Fig. 7 a using Eq. (17). The best fit gives the values of α to be 0.48 and 0.45 and of β to be 0.75 and 0.77 for D2 and D4, respectively. The fitted values for both cells are assumed to be constant while variableβ values vs Fermi level can be interpreted as different traps contributions in recombination [19]. The explanation for the latter might arise from the different effective electron population regions of the two cells contributing in recombination. For D2 and D4, for voltage values between 0.45–0.8 and less than 0.45, respectively, V oc decay vs time deviates from the fitting model. These observations suggest a direct reaction of trapped electrons with the I 3 − [45]. The TCO/electrolyte reaction can be neglected due to the applied TiCl 4 treatment of the substrates, as a result the nonlinearity can be mainly attributed to the direct transfer of the trapped electron to the I 3 − . The simulated values for electron lifetimes vs Fermi level variations are plotted in Fig. 7b. Bisquirt et al. [13] explained that the exponential and parabolic shape of the logarithmic τ vs Fermi level variations can be assumed as different electron transfer pathways, from CB to electrolyte accompanying the change of the rate of trapping/detrapping and from surface trap states to electrolyte, respectively. The obtained τ vs Fermi level represents different regimes of behavior. At high Fermi levels in which the lifetime of the electrons in CB is observed without the traps involvement. At mid-Fermi level where charge transfer is still dominated by CB states. However, it is controlled by electron trapping/detrapping. At low Fermi levels, the charge transfer is mainly governed by the distribution of surface traps. The mentioned classified regions can be obviously distinguished for D2 and D4. For both of them, lifetime values below 0.7eV increases exponentially, corresponding to the second region and the C.B capacitance becomes dominant. For D4 with Fermi level below 0.4eV the lifetime shows the parabolic shape, which implies the dominant transfer through surface states at the Fermi level. The same parabolic shape is seen below 0.45eV for D4, which can be interpreted as a longer tail of trap states. These evidences lead to the fact that the lower trap density in D2 is the main reason for higher transport rate of electrons to substrate comparing to D4. There are several ways to determine the capacitance of nanoporous semiconductor films: cyclic voltammetry [47], EIS [48,49]. Several physical aspects can be assumed contributing to the measured capacitance. First, polarization at the interface of TCO and the electrolyte, and second, the Helmholtz layer formed at the metal oxide/electrolyte interface. When the electron density is low in the semiconductor the first effect is important and the latter when the density is very high and the semiconductor enters the state of band unpinning. Both of these contributions can be considered as ordinary electrostatic capacitors. However, for the intermediate range of Fermi levels, a different kind of capacitive effect emerges. When the semiconductor bands are pinned, and the charge accumulation is related to the displacement of the Fermi level position with respect to the C.B edge or more accurately, to a variation of chemical potential of electrons. Therefore, the increment of electronic and ionic charges occurs in the volume of the nanostructured electrode with no significant electrical field variation in the volume, because the electrical field is screened near the TCO [50]. The simulated capacitance for D2 and D4 presents an exponential variation with Fermi level (Fig. 7c), corresponding to a trap energy distribution below the C.B edge [51]. Chemical capacitance data can help to detect shifts in the C.B edge [52]. Taking this shift into account for photoanode structures with similar tap distributions (i.e. DSSCs with identical parts) allows us to compare the electron properties of DSSCs based on different sensitizers and electrolytes [53]. 4.4 The dye regeneration efficiency (η reg ) and its relevance to applied bias As mentioned earlier, after photoelectrons are injected from the excited dye molecules into the C.B of TiO 2, the resulting oxidized dye molecules are reduced by I −in the electrolyte for regeneration or by electrons in TiO 2 C.B for recombination. Here, we investigate the effect of different applied voltages and I −concentrations on η reg . Fig. 8 depicts the steady state density profile of dye cations resulted from Eq. (8) for D3 under SC. Fig. 9 a–c plot the calculated results of the η reg for different voltage ranges and electron density profiles. The electron density profiles at steady state, resulted from solution of Eqs. (1), (5) and (6) at different voltages from zero to open circuit, are used to calculated the η reg . Under SC, the values of η reg are maximum and it undergoes a negligable drop (vs electron density) by decreasing [I −] concentrations (1.5–0mol). It is clearly seen that by increasing the [I −]. concentration the η reg increases. However, higher [I −] concentrations results in a larger drop of η reg . by increased electron density profile. Besides, for low [I −] concentrations, η reg remains almost constant. For voltages less than the voltage at maximum power point (V mpp ), 100≤ V ≤500, η reg experiences a more significant drop of about 10–20% for [I ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
] concentration of 0.75-1.5mol. Nevertheless, for low [I −] concentrations, it looks similar to that of SC condition. For high voltages, 500mV < V, it is similar to SC condition except for stronger drop of η reg for high [I −]. concentrations than that of SC condition. It can be concluded that regeneration efficiency is negatively affected at voltages smaller than V mpp and shows an exponential decay. It can be assumed that η r e g = η r e g 0 E x p ( − V ( n ) / C ) ≈ η r e g 0 ( 1 + ( V / C ) ) − 1 where C is a constant to determine the decrease rate. This relation can be useful while model-fitting the experiment to determine the rate of regeneration efficiency of the sensitizers by electrolyte redox. Anta et al. [55] and Jennings et al. [54] estimated maximum drop of around 10% while our calculations indicate about 10–20% drop in η reg around V mpp . Fig. 10 shows the η reg for [I −] concentration of 1.5mol and various γ values. As mentioned before, γ determines the nonlinearity order of the recombination of C.B electrons with [D +] molecules. η reg for values of γ <0.3 takes the maximum values of 0.9–1. This is due to the contribution of deep localized states, which function as trapping/detrapping centers for electrons. Occupation of larger fraction of trap states by electrons means lower rate of recombination with [D +] molecules. As a result, the chance for [D +] molecules to be regenerated by [I −] becomes higher. Interestingly, for mid-band trap levels (0.3≤ γ <0.7), the η reg shows a dramatic decrease over the whole potential range. For near C.B edge electrons (0.7≤ γ ≤1), the reaction with [ D + ] molecules is much faster, giving rise to poor regeneration efficiency. 5 Conclusion A modeling simulation based on multi-trap formalism and a standard electrochemical approach is developed to investigate the transport properties of charged species involved in DSSC operation under steady state and transient behavior. The model- fitting presents a reliable estimation of DSSC underlying factors such as series resistance, diffusion and recombination coefficients and trap parameters which control the shape of J − V curves and current and voltage time dependent responses. The dependence of charged carrier densities, J sc , V oc , diffusion length and efficiency on film thickness, light intensity were investigated. An efficiency limiting film thickness of 20 μm was also predicted. The model also enables us to calculate chemical capacitance which is used to estimate the shift in band gap of TiO 2 under contact with electrolyte and dye molecules. Finally, the dye regeneration efficiency dependence on applied voltage is discussed considering the modeling framework. The findings highlight the negative role of applied voltage on the regeneration efficiency particularly for voltages close to maximum power point where the role of series resistance is also dominant on overall DSSC performance. The presented modeling process can be used for obtaining a meaningful fit to experimental data for a particular manufactured cell in order to find the parameters influencing device performance. Further development of the present work for optimization of parameters involves introducing more fundamental parameters such as LUMO-TiO 2 C.B gap, the carrier hopping effect, and temperature and electron density dependent injection efficiency. Also, exploiting the model’s potential to explain the recent improvement of the performance in cobalt-based electrolyte DSSCs is our current challenge. Appendix A Derivation of continuity equation for electrons In a semiconductor when the Fermi level is separated from the CB by more than 3K b T, as K b to be the Boltzmann constant, we can write Fermi-Dirac equation is approximated to Boltzmann equation (A1.1) f ( E ) ≈ f B ( E ) = e x p [ − E f 0 K b T ] If E f0is the Fermi level with no illumination, then the CB electron density n c 0 can be written as (A1.2) n c 0 = N c e x p [ − E f 0 K b T ] where N c = 2 ( 2 π m e * K b T h 2 ) 3 2 is the effective density of states in the CB, m e * is the electron effective mass and ℏ is the Planck constant. According to the QFL approximation, under illumination electrons are injected to the CB and the Fermi level is raised, so (A1.3) n c ( x ) = N c e x p ( − E f ( x ) K b T ) In a nanocrystalline semiconductor the trap energy distribution follows from (A1.4) g ( E t ) = α N t K T e x p ( − α E t K b T ) where N t , α andT are the total trap density, trap parameters and temperature respectively. Assume that most electrons are tapped ( n ≈ n t ) w e can write: (A1.5) n ( x ) = N t e x p ( − α E f K b T ) (A1.6) n 0 = N t e x p ( − α E f 0 K b T ) Combining Eqs. (A1.3) and (A1.6) we arrive at: (A1.7) K b T L n ( n 0 n ( x ) ) = α ( K b T L n ( n c 0 n c ( x ) ) ) . where n and n c . are total and free electron densities. The continuity equations for electrons in the photoanode is (A1.8) ( 1 − Θ ) ( ∂ n t ( x , t ) ∂ t + ∂ n c ( x , t ) ∂ t ) = ( 1 − Θ ) Γ ξ 2 ∂ ∂ x D 0 ∂ n c ( x , t ) ∂ x + G e ( x , λ ) − R e ( x , t ) where D 0 is the diffusion coefficient andn t , n c are trapped and free electron densities. Θ is the porosity of the TiO 2 film, Γ andξ are constrictivity and tortuosity, respectively [14]. Γ can narrow the carriers pathway and ξ makes them pass through a more indirect route. G e ( x , λ ) is the electron generation term for working electrode side illumination and is calculated applying the Beer-Lambert law for the absorption coefficient: (A1.9) G e ( x , λ ) = ∫ λ m i n λ m a x φ i n j I 0 ( λ ) α ( λ ) e x p [ − α ( λ ) x ] d λ while for the counter electrode (CE) side illumination we have: (A1.10) G e ( x , λ ) = ∫ λ m i n λ m a x φ i n j I 0 ( λ ) a b s ( λ ) e x p [ − a b s ( λ ) ( d − x ) ] d λ where φ inj is the quantum injection yield, I 0 ( λ ) the solar irradiation spectrum for AM1.5 and α ( λ ) the absorption coefficient of the N719 dye. The absorbance of N719 dye solution is obtained from literature [19]. The charge reaction transfer between TiO 2 and redox electrolyte is a single electron reaction I − k b k f ⇌ I + e − in which k f and k b are forward and backward reaction rates. Applying a standard chemical approach, the reaction rates are proportional to concentrations of species involved. In the absence of illumination we have (A1.11) k f n I 0 = k b n 0 n i 0 where nI is the iodine (I) density − the oxidized species of the charge-transfer reaction. Eq. (A1.11) implies that the forward reaction rate equals the backward reaction rate. Finally the net electron flow at the interface may be written as (A1.12) R e = k b n n I − k f n i Taking the mass action law into account and considering non-linear chemical kinetics, the recombination term can be rewritten as: (A1.13) R e ( x , t ) = k 0 { ( n c ( x , t ) ) β n t r i ( x , t ) n i ( x , t ) − n 0 β n t r i 0 ( n i 0 ) 3 n i ( x , t ) } + k 1 ( n c ( x , t ) − n 0 ) γ [ D + ] ( x , t ) where k 0 and β are the recombination rate and the nonlinearity recombination parameter for, respectively. n c ( x , t ) , n t r i ( x , t ) , n i ( x , t ) , n°,n tri0 and n i0 are the electron densities in the CB, the tri-iodide density, the iodide density, the initial electron density in the CB, the initial tri-iodide density and the initial iodide density respectively. Making use of mathematical form of the QSA: (A1.14) ∂ n c ( x , t ) ∂ t = ∂ n c ( x , t ) ∂ n t ∂ n t ( x , t ) ∂ t and using Eq. (A1.7) and assuming that most electrons are trapped ( n ≈ n t ) , one obtains: (A1.15) ∂ n t ∂ n c = ( N c α N t 1 α n 1 − α α ) − 1 By considering electron density dependent diffusion and recombination constants as (A1.16) D ( n ) = D 0 ∂ n c ∂ n t a n d k ( n ) = k R ( N c ) β α N t β α n ( β α − 1 ) where k R is the recombination constant, and QSA n c ( x , t ) = N c ( n ( x , t ) N t ) 1 α . and rewriting Eq. (A1.8), we reach the electr on continuity equation (A1.17) ( 1 − Θ ) ( 1 + D ( n ) D 0 ) ∂ n ( x , t ) ∂ t = ( 1 − Θ ) Γ ξ 2 ∂ ∂ x ( D ( n ) ∂ n ( x , t ) ∂ x ) + G e ( x , λ ) − { k ( n ) n ( x , t ) n t r i ( x , t ) n i ( x , t ) − k R ( n 0 ) β n t r i 0 ( n i 0 ) 3 n i ( x , t ) } − k 1 ( n c ( x ," t ) − n 0 ) γ + d n t c o d x """," [1] B.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.113,Influences of oceanic turbulence on Lorentz Gaussian beam,"Abstract Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel integral, the propagation of a Lorentz Gaussian beam in oceanic turbulence is investigated. The influences of oceanic turbulence parameters (the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid, the rate of dissipation of mean square temperature, and the relative strength of temperature and salinity fluctuations) on average intensity of a Lorentz Gaussian beam are analyzed by using the numerical examples. The results show that a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in stronger oceanic turbulence will spread faster.",Feb-18," Keywords Oceanic turbulence Lorentz gaussian beam Laser propagation Average intensity 1 Introduction Laser beams propagating in random media such as atmospheric turbulence and oceanic turbulence are required in applications of underwater and atmosphere laser wireless communication [1]. In recent years, the propagation properties of various kinds of laser beams in oceanic turbulence have been widely investigated, such as stochastic electromagnetic beam [2], partially coherent radially polarized doughnut beam [3], Gaussian Schell-model vortex beam [4], stochastic electromagnetic vortex beam [5], partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian linear array beam [6], Gaussian array beam [7,8], multimode laser beams [9], partially coherent cylindrical vector beam [10], flat-topped vortex hollow beam [11,12], chirped Gaussian pulsed beam [13], Lorentz beam [14], partially coherent four-petal Gaussian beam [15] and partially coherent four-petal Gaussian vortex beam [16]. With the development of diode lasers, the model of diode laser source called Lorentz beam has been introduced [17]. Since then, the propagating properties of Lorentz and Lorentz Gaussian beams propagating through free space, optical system and turbulent atmosphere have been widely investigated [18–20]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the influences of oceanic turbulence on the average intensity of a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence have not been investigated and reported. In this work, based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel integral formula, we obtained the expression of a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence, and studied the influences of the parameters of oceanic turbulence such as the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid, the rate of dissipation of mean square temperature, and the relative strength of temperature and salinity fluctuations on average intensity properties of a Lorentz Gaussian beam by using numerical examples. 2 Theory analysis In this work, the propagation direction of laser beam in oceanic turbulence can be taken to z axis, the Lorentz Gaussian beam in the source plane can be expressed as [19]: (1) E ( r 0 , 0 ) = 1 w 0 x w 0 y [ 1 + ( x 0 w 0 x ) 2 ] [ 1 + ( y 0 w 0 y ) 2 ] exp ( − r 0 2 w 0 2 ) where r 0 = ( x 0 , y 0 ) is the position vector at the source plane; w0x and w0y are the parameters related to the beam widths of Lorentz part in the x and y directions, respectively. w 0 is the waist of the Gaussian part. Utilizing the relationship of Lorentz distribution and Hermite-Gaussian function [21] (2) 1 ( x 0 2 + w 0 x 2 ) ( y 0 2 + w 0 y 2 ) = π 2 w 0 x 2 w 0 y 2 ∑ m = 0 N ∑ n = 0 N σ 2 m σ 2 n H 2 m ( x 0 w 0 x ) H 2 n ( y 0 w 0 y ) × exp ( − x 0 2 2 w 0 x 2 − y 0 2 2 w 0 y 2 ) where N is the number of the expansion. σ2m and σ2n are the expanded coefficients and are given in Ref. [21], with the increasing the even number 2m and 2n, the value of σ2m and σ2n dramatically decrease. Therefore, N will not be large in the calculations, in this work, N is set as N=5. H2m and H2n are the 2m and 2n order Hermite polynomial, and the Hermite polynomial H 2 m ( x ) can be expressed as [22]: (3) H 2 m ( x ) = ∑ l = 0 m ( − 1 ) l ( 2 m ) ! l ! ( 2 m − 2 l ) ! ( 2 x ) 2 m − 2 l By substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we can obtain, a Lorentz Gaussian beam in the source plane can be rewritten as: (4) E ( x 0 , y 0 , 0 ) = π 2 w 0 x w 0 y ∑ m = 0 N ∑ n = 0 N σ 2 m σ 2 n H 2 m ( x 0 w 0 x ) H 2 n ( y 0 w 0 y ) × exp ( − x 0 2 u x 2 − y 0 2 u y 2 ) with (5a) 1 u x 2 = 1 w 0 2 + 1 2 w 0 x 2 (5b) 1 u y 2 = 1 w 0 2 + 1 2 w 0 y 2 Within the framework of paraxial approximation, the propagation of Lorentz Gaussian beam in oceanic turbulence can be investigated by using the extended Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral [1–14]: (6) E ( r , z ) = − i k 2 π z exp ( − i k z ) ∫ − ∞ + ∞ ∫ − ∞ + ∞ E ( r 0 , 0 ) exp [ − i k 2 z ( r- r 0 ) 2 ] exp [ ψ ( r 0 , r , z ) ] d r 0 where r = ( x , y ) is the position vector at the output plane; k = 2 π / λ is the wave number; ψ ( r 0 , r , z ) is the solution to the Rytov method that represents the random part of the complex phase for the turbulent media; Then the average intensity of a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence in the receiver plane can be given as: (7) 〈 I ( r , z ) 〉 = k 2 4 π 2 z 2 ∭ ∫ − ∞ + ∞ E ( r 10 , 0 ) E * ( r 20 , 0 ) exp [ − i k 2 z ( r- r 10 ) 2 + i k 2 z ( r- r 20 ) 2 ] × 〈 exp [ ψ ( r , r 10 ) + ψ ∗ ( r , r 10 ) ] 〉 d r 10 d r 20 Where the angle bracket indicates the ensemble average over the medium statistics covering the log-amplitude and phase fluctuations due to oceanic turbulence, and the asterisk denotes the complex conjugation. And the last term in Eq. (7) can be expressed as follows: (8) 〈 exp [ ψ ( r , r 10 ) + ψ ∗ ( r , r 20 ) ] 〉 = exp [ − M ( r 10 − r 20 ) 2 ] with (9) M = π 2 k 2 z 3 ∫ 0 ∞ d κ κ Φ ( κ ) and (10) Φ ( κ ) = 0.388 × 10 − 8 ε − 11 / 3 [ 1 + 2.35 ( κ η ) 2 / 3 ] f ( κ , ς , χ T ) In the Eq. (10), the rate of dissipation of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid ε may vary in the rage from 10−1m2s−3 to 10−10m2s−3. And η is the Kolmogorov micro scale (inner scale), in this work we choose η =10−3. The last term in Eq. (10) has the form (11) f ( κ , ς , χ T ) = χ T ς 2 [ ς 2 exp ( − A T δ ) + exp ( − A S δ ) − 2 ς exp ( − A T S δ ) ] and χT is the rate of dissipation of mean square temperature taking value in the range from 10−4K2s−1 to 10−10K2s−1 for oceanic turbulence, AT =1.863×10−2, AS =1.9×10−4, ATS =9.41×10−3, δ = 8.284 ( κ η ) 4 / 3 + 12.978 ( κ η ) 2 , ς is the relative strength of temperature and salinity fluctuations, which in the ocean waters can vary in the range from −5 to 0. By substituting Eq. (4) into Eq.

(14)–(18) are the obtained formula for the average intensity of a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence. 3 Graphical results and discussions In this section, as numerical examples, the average intensity properties of a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence are illustrated by using the formulas derived above. In the following numerical calculations, the parameters of beam and oceanic turbulence are chosen as follows: λ =532nm, w 0 =1cm, ς =− 2.5, χ T = 10 − 9 K 2 / s , ε =10−7m2s−1 in the whole work without specifying in captions. The normalized average intensity distribution and corresponding contour graphs of a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence at the different propagation distance z for the different w0x and w0y are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. In Fig. 1, the waist of Gaussian part is larger than the related width of the Lorentz part; in Fig. 2 , the waist of Gaussian part is equal to the related width of the Lorentz part in x direction of the beam, and the waist of Gaussian part is smaller than the related width of the Lorentz part in y direction of the beam. From Figs. 1 and 2, it is observed that the Lorentz Gaussian beam with the different w0x and w0y will keep its initial profile under the short propagation distance (Figs. 1 and 2a and b); and with the propagation distance z increases, the initial profile of Lorentz Gaussian beam will gradually change, and the spot of Lorentz Gaussian beam will change to be a Gaussian-like beam in the x and y direction (Figs. 1 and 2d). By comparing Figs. 1 and 2, it is shown that Lorentz Gaussian beam with w0x =w0y =2mm will spread smaller than the Lorentz Gaussian beam with w0x =10mm and w0y =20mm with the propagation increases; and the reason is that the spreading of the Lorentz distribution in oceanic turbulence is higher than that the Gaussian distribution with the propagation increases. In order to investigate the influences of oceanic turbulence parameters (the rate of dissipation of mean square temperature χT , the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid ε and the relative strength of temperature and salinity fluctuations ς) on the average intensity of a Lorentz Gaussian beam. Due to the x and y parts of Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence are separate (see Eq. (14)), then Figs. 3–5 give the cross line (y=0) of normalized average intensity for a Lorentz Gaussian beam with w 0x =w 0y = 2mm propagating in oceanic turbulence for the different χT , ε and ς, respectively. It is shown that the parameters of oceanic will affect the spreading propagating of a Lorentz Gaussian beam in Figs. 3–5. It is found that a Lorentz Gaussian beam will spread into the Gaussian-like beam faster with the larger oceanic parameter xT (Fig. 3) as the propagating distance z increases, and the larger oceanic parameters xT means that the oceanic turbulence is stronger. And the oceanic turbulence strength will increase with the oceanic turbulence parameters ε (Fig. 4) and ς (Fig. 5) decrease, so it is also found that a Lorentz Gaussian beam will spread faster with ε or ς decreases. So from Figs. 3–5, it is found that the stronger oceanic turbulence (the increase of oceanic parameter xT or the decrease of oceanic parameters ε and ς) will spread into Gaussian-like beam faster due to the influence of stronger oceanic turbulence. 4 Conclusion In this paper, the spreading properties of a Lorentz Gaussian beam propagating in oceanic turbulence are examined by using numerical examples in detail. The influences of oceanic parameters χT , ε and ς on the average intensity and spreading of a Lorentz Gaussian beam are analyzed. As the Lorentz Gaussian beam propagates in oceanic turbulence, the spot of a Lorentz Gaussian beam will change to be a Gaussian-like beam. And the beam propagates in stronger oceanic turbulence (the increase of oceanic parameter xT or the decrease of oceanic parameters ε and ς) will spread into Gaussian-like beam faster due to the influence of stronger oceanic turbulence.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.031,A stepped Mach-Zehnder interferometric humidity sensor based on lateral offset fusion splicing,"Abstract A novel optical fiber relative humidity (RH) sensor based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. The sensor head is formed by a single-mode-multimode-single-mode-single-mode(SM-MM-SM-SM) fiber structure through lateral offset fusion splicing. The intermodal interference is achieved by two lateral offset points. The change of relative humidity will cause the optical path difference changed of the core mode and cladding modes, which gives rise to the interference pattern change. The ambient RH change can be determined by monitoring the energy variation of the interference pattern. The experimental results show the dip energy of the transmission spectrum changes with respect to surrounding RH with good linearity. The MZI with a interferometer length of 15mm offers the enhanced RH sensitivity of −0.0487dB/%RH in the range of 35–95%RH with linearity of 0.9966. The proposed humidity has compact size, simple fabrication procedure and does not need any functional coating, making it a good candidate for RH measurements.",Feb-18," Keywords Optical fiber sensor Multimode fiber Relative humidity Mach-Zehnder interferometer 1 Introduction With the rapid development of wind power industry, wind power generation has been become a new and mature power generation technology. However, the majority of wind turbines are installed in outdoor area, high relative humidity and low temperature are a common problem faced by these wind farms, which leads to negative effect of wind turbines, including the unit corrosion, blade loading and lubricating oil and electronic components, parts of the performance, aerodynamic performance and load, unit operation and maintenance. Therefore, relative humidity measurement is particularly important [1]. Fiber-optical sensors have the unique advantages, such as small size, high sensitivity and good remote operation. Once these fiber sensors are inserted into the inside of each wind turbine by the way of parallel system, it can be achieved constant monitoring the operation of the wind turbine. Recently, Many fiber sensors with different types and structures have been proposed to measure relative humidity, including Fabry-Perot (F-P) fiber sensor [2–4], fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) [5,6], Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) [7,8], long period gratings (LPGs) [9,10]. Fu et al. [11] proposed a microfiber RH sensor based on PM-elliptical fiber. The sensor with a thinner diameter of 4.7μm provides the sensitivity of 114.7pm/(%RH) in the range from 30 to 90%RH and has good linearity between wavelength and RH. Shohei et al. [12] proposed humidity sensor based on a section of hetero-core fiber sandwiched between two pieces of MMF. However, the sensitivity of the sensor remained low despite being coated with hygroscopic polymer layers. Nan et al. [13] proposed a hollow-core fiber (HCF) sandwiched between two single-mode fibers (SMFs) with a sensitivity of 1.29pm/%RH. Owing to the silica hardly show good response to humidity, these various additionally functionalized materials are coated onto the fiber surface to enhance humidity sensitivity. Yulianti et al. [14] proposed the sensor which is Fabry–Perot cavity formed by two identical uniform fiber Bragg gratings and polyimide is coated on the FBG. Li et al. [15] proposed an tapered MMF coated with polyvinyl alcohol film cascading with fiber Bragg Grating to measure RH. Liu et al. [16] proposed S-taper fiber which is fabricated as the sensitive element by using simple fusion spicing and the S-tapered region is coated with a layer of hydrophilic material. Coating kinds of functionalized material can improve RH sensitivity, but the surface of sensor is very difficult to control material uniformity. In this paper, a new RH sensor based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is proposed. The stepped sensor is fabricated by using fusion splicer. Due to large fiber core lateral offset, making the proposed sensor that is sensitive to external RH. Relative humidity measurement is realized by monitoring the energy variation of the interference pattern. Experimental results show that the sensor has high sensitivity, simple fabrication and compact structure. 2 Sensor fabrication and principle The proposed MZI consists of an uncoated SMF section sandwiched between a short piece of MMF and output SMF in a way of fiber core lateral offset, which are employed as mode couplers due to the lateral offset point to split and recombine light, thus form an in-fiber MZI, as shown in Fig. 1 . The MMF length, the SMF length and the distance of fiber core lateral offset are represented by L1, L2, d1 and d2, respectively. The operating principle can be described as follows: When light is injected into the MMF core through an input SMF and partly coupled to the cladding of the sensing SMF (centre section) at the first lateral offset point, and some cladding modes are excited. Then the core mode and cladding modes of the sensing SMF separately propagate along the fiber with an effective index difference and finally recombined at the second lateral offset point, where the two modes interfere with each other due to the accumulated phase difference. Thus through another output SMF, it gives rise to the intermodal interference. The expression of transmission intensity of a stepped MZI can be expressed as [17]: (1) I = I c o r e + ∑ m I c l a d d i n g m + ∑ m 2 I c o r e I c l a d d i n g m ⋅ cos ( Δ φ ) Where I core and I c l a d d i n g m are the intensity of the core mode and cladding modes, respectively. Δφ is defined as the phase difference and can be expressed as [18]: (2) Δ φ = 2 π ( n c o r e − n c l a d d i n g m ) λ ⋅ L 2 Where n core and n c l a d d i n g m are the effective refractive index of the core mode and cladding modes, respectively. When the interference spectrum reach minimum, the phase difference is written as [18]: (3) Δ φ = ( 2 k + 1 ) π Where k is an integer. And according to the interference theory, the wavelength spacing between two adjacent transmission minimums Δλ can be written as [19]: (4) Δ λ = λ 2 Δ n e f f L 2 where Δ n e f f = ( n e f f c o r e − n e f f c l a d d i n g , m ) . As seen from Eq. (4), the wavelength spacing can be decreased with the length of interferometer arm L2 increases. When the external RH is applied on the sensor, the effective refractive index of cladding modes will be changed, which leads to the energy of the transmission spectrum changed. When the outside temperature is constant, Eq. (1) is taken the derivative with respect to RH, the RH sensitivity of the sensor can be expressed as: (5) d I d ( R H ) = d ∑ m I c l a d d i n g m ( R H ) d ( R H ) + ∑ m I c o r e I c l a d d i n g m ( R H ) − 1 2 × I c o r e d I c l a d d i n g m ( R H ) d ( R H ) × cos 2 π λ n e f f c o r e − n e f f c l a d d i n g , m ( R H ) ⋅ L + ∑ m I c o r e I c l a d d i n g m ( R H ) × sin 2 π λ n e f f c o r e − n e f f c l a d d i n g , m ( R H ) ⋅ L × 4 π λ ⋅ L ⋅ d n e f f c l a d d i n g , m ( R H ) d ( R H ) From Eq. (5), it can be seen that the RH sensitivity will be calculated. As the RH increases gradually in the environment, the refractive index of the air can be increased, which cause the cladding effective refractive index increased. According to the evanescent-wave principle, outward radiant energy will increase, which leads to the intensity of cladding modes reduced, but the intensity of the core mode is unchanged, thus, the transmission spectrum intensity of the sensor can be reduced. By monitoring transmission spectrum energy change, the external RH can be determined. The stepped Mach-Zehnder interferometer is fabricated by using SMF (OPEAK, S9/125) and MMF (OPEAK, S105/125). The MMF is removed from its jacket, and the two fiber ends are cleaved by using fiber cleaver (Furukawa, S325). The SMF and prepared MMF are put on the optical adjusting bracket of a commercial fusion splicer. The first welding point is fabricated by employing the SM–MM fusion program. A section of SMF is sandwiched between SMF and MMF, and formed the structure of SMF-MMF-SMF-SMF. The length of MMF is controlled in 700μm, and the lateral offset d1 is 58μm. The sensing SMF (centre section) and the output SMF have a small core dislocation d2. Experimental result shows that the quality of the interference spectrum is determined by d2. Thus the lateral offset d2 must be needed two conditions: one is that the interference spectrum has been displayed a clear fringe pattern with high extinction ratio over 10dB. Other is that the interference spectrum should be presented more periodicity in order to observe obviously the power change in the process of actual measurement. After many tries, the lateral offset d2 is set to be 3μm. All welding loss caused by arc discharge is controlled within 0.05dB, therefore, the fabrication process of the sensor has good repeatability. The transmission spectra of the stepped MZI with different interferometer lengths L2 are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be found from Fig. 2 that the interference spectrum has good periodicity and large extinction ratio, which contents the requirements of actual measurement. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the period of the interference patterns increases with increasing of the length of L2, and the free spectral range (FSR) decreases, which is in agreement with Eq. (4). For further theoretical analysis, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the transmission spectrum can be taken to obtain the spatial spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3 . The spatial spectrum ε can be given as [20]: (6) ε = 1 λ 0 2 Δ m e f f ⋅ L Where λ 0 is the center wavelength; Δ m e f f = Δ n e f f − λ 0 ∂ ∂ λ Δ n e f f represents the differential modal group index; L is the length of the sensor. As can be seen from Eq. (6), the spatial frequency ε is directly proportional to the length of the interferometer L and the effective refractive index difference Δm eff . As shown in Fig. 3, the spatial frequency spectra shows several peaks, which indicates that many modes participate in the interference, but one peak dominates for every interference spectrum. The spatial frequency corresponding to the lower peak amplitude is bigger than the spatial frequency of the dominant peak amplitude, which shows that the interference pattern is very stable. The dominant peak amplitudes have been marked and are located at 0.0866nm−1 and 0.0998nm−1, respectively. Compared to the spatial frequency of sensor S-1, sensor S-2 is bigger, the main reason is that sensor S-2 is longer interferometer length than sensor S-1, according to Eq. (6), the spatial frequency of sensor S-2 is bigger than sensor S-1, which is in agreement to experimental result. Owning to the high-order modes corresponding to the higher spatial frequency, so the main contribution of intermodal interference is the low-order modes, therefore, it can be considered that the interference pattern is mainly formed by the low-order modes and the fundamental mode. 3 Experimental results and discussion The schematic diagram of the RH measuring system is shown in Fig. 4 . Sensor S-1 and sensor S-2 are selected as measuring RH. The sensor is placed in a programmable constant temperature and humidity testing machine (RH chamber, We-won, WHTH-225L). Two ends of sensing head are connected to the broadband light source (BBS, Lightcomm, ASE-CL) and optical spectrum analyzer (OSA, Anritsu, MS9740A) by single-mode fibers, respectively. The optical spectrum analyzer has a minimum resolution of 20pm. Due to bending can cause transmission energy loss of this type MZI, thus the sensor is carefully fixed on plexiglass that has a distribution of holes for moisture to pass through. When the sensor is exposed to humidity environment, the water molecules in the air will be absorbed by silica, which causes interference modes effective refractive index changed and leads the these modes to induce phase difference, so it causes interference spectrum drift. The RH can be determined by monitoring the change of the interference spectrum. Accurate measurement of RH and temperature can be achieved by using this control measurement system. The maximum available measurement range of humidity and temperature is 20–98% RH and −20–150°C, and the measurement error is ±1%RH and ±0.2°C, respectively. In the experiment, the temperature is controlled at 35°C in the RH measurement process. The RH is changed from 35%RH to 95%RH with a step of 10%RH. The dip at the wavelength of 1565.41nm and 1561.54nm of the sensor S-1 and S-2 are selected as the monitoring point. When the transmission spectrum reached a stable value at each RH point, the interference patterns are recorded, as shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5, with RH increases, the transmission spectrum dip energy of sensor S-1 and S-2 occur obvious decreasing, and the maximum change of intensity reach 2.42dB and 2.96dB, respectively. The wavelength occur red-shift, and the maximum drift of wavelength reach 0.07nm and 0.12nm at the monitoring point, which is in agreement with theoretical analysis. The variation of dip energy of interference spectrum is more obvious than the shift of wavelength, and it is more sensitive and easier to measure. Sensor S-2 is selected to investigate the time response for the purpose of practical applications. In this experiment, the close chamber is initially at 66%RH. Fig. 6 shows the temporal profile of intensity as the change of the RH condition from 66%RH to 85%RH by automatically regulating the proportion of dry air and humid air for RH chamber. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the rise time of the sensor corresponding to a 19%RH change is 14.1s; When RH is decreased from 85%RH to 66%RH, the sensor takes about 10.5s. The intensity reaches the transient dip of 1.15dB and stays a stationary state because of the flow equilibrium process. Since the humid air need take time to be filled with the RH chamber, thus we believe the actual response time of the sensor should be less than experimental result. This proves that the proposed sensor in this work has a fast time response. For further theoretical analysis the relationship between the energy of the dip and RH, the energy variation of the dip at 1565.41nm and 1561.54nm are fitted to the RH, as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7(a) and (b) illustrates the intensity respect to surrounding RH change, respectively. The dots are measured values. The different straight line is the linear fit. It is clear that energy shift shows a good linear relationship with the RH change, and the sensor has a high reversibility in RH increasing and decreasing process. The sensitivity of sensor S-1 and S-2 are −0.0396dB/%RH and −0.0487dB/%RH in the RH range of 35–95%RH with the linear correlative coefficients of 0.9904 and 0.9966, respectively. Compared with sensor S-1, the sensitivity of sensor S-2 is obviously improved. This is because that sensor S-2 is longer sensing length than sensor S-1, which leads to more energy coupled to external environment to strengthen humidity interaction. The temperature change also causes the drift of the transmission spectrum. When the RH is constant, the content of water molecules in the air will decrease gradually as the temperature increases. Therefore, temperature should also be considered in the RH measurement process. Sensor S-1 and S-2 are conducted temperature test. The RH is controlled at 35%RH conditions. The temperature is gradually increased from 35°C to 75°C with a step of 10°C, and the transmission spectrum is recorded when the transmission spectrum is reached a stable value at each temperature point, as shown in Fig. 8 . The dips at the wavelength of 1565.41nm and 1561.54nm of the sensor S-1 and S-2 are selected as the monitoring point. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that with temperature increases, the transmission spectrum occur obviously redshift, and the maximum change reached 1.45nm and 1.97nm, respectively. Owing to the thermo-optical coefficients and thermal expansion effect, the interference length and effective refractive index difference of the sensor increase with the external temperature rise, which induce the transmission spectrum towards long-wave direction. But the intensity of the monitoring point barely moves. Fig. 9 is the transmission spectral response of sensor S-1 and S-2 at different temperatures, which shows that the transmission spectrum energy remains almost constant in the case of temperature change. Compared with previous RH response characteristics, the sensor can be used to measure simultaneously relative humidity and temperature by respective monitoring energy and wavelength change. The actual measurement environment is always worse, so the stability of sensor is very important to the accuracy of the measurement results. Sensor S-2 is selected to test its stability. The sensor is placed in RH chamber under constant RHs of 45%RH, 65%RH and 95%RH for a long-time measurement, respectively. Temperature is controlled at 35°C. The intensity of the selected interference dip is selected to record its change and plotted every 10min, as shown in Fig. 10 . In the test time of 120min, the maximum intensity fluctuation does not exceed ±0.01dB, thus the standard deviation of the RH reaches about 21%RH. The deviation of intensity may be the vibration of the machine or airflows itself. 4 Conclusion In this paper, a new relative humidity sensor based on a MZI is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. A section of SMF is sandwiched between MMF and SMF, and fabricated a large fiber core lateral offset, which forms the stepped MZI. Experimental result shows that the lateral offset distance between the sensing SMF and output SMF can affect the quality of transmission spectrum. The proposed sensor has a good reversibility with the increasing and decreasing of relative humidity. The RH sensitivity is −0.0487dB/%RH in the range of 35–95%RH with linearity of 0.9966 for the MZI with a 15mm interferometer length. Moreover, temperature response characteristics are investigated. Experimental results suggest that the transmission spectrum intensity of the sensor is insensitive to temperature, which demonstrates its potential for measuring simultaneous RH and temperature by respective monitoring intensity and wavelength change. Additionally, the proposed sensor has the advantages of simple structure, easy manufacture process and low cost, which make it a good candidate for relative humidity measurement in worse environment.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.063,Optical soliton solutions of higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation in monomode fibers and its applications,"Abstract In this article, we have discussed the analytical solution to the higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation representing the propagation of short light pulses in the monomode optical fibers. A simple transformation is introduced to convert the nonlinear partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation. A verity of traveling solutions are obtained by employing the auxiliary equation method. The technique can also be functional to other sorts of nonlinear evolution equations in contemporary areas of research.",Feb-18," Keywords Higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation Auxiliary equation method Soliton solutions 1 Introduction In dispersive medium, the propagation of nonlinear waves is of great interest in the recent era of contemporary science and technology. The nonlinear transformation of dielectric of the fiber termed as the Kerr effect, is applied to neutralize the dispersion effect, in this state the optical pulse may tend to form a steady nonlinear pulse known as optical soliton. The bit rate of transmission is limited by the dispersion of the fiber material. The fiber loss is the only factor that contributes to the drop of the pulse quality by expansion in the pulse width, for details see [1–7]. In last some decades, both mathematician and physicist have made much efforts in finding the analytic solutions to a number of nonlinear models. As a result, many powerful techniques are introduced to deal with problems involving nonlinear complex phenomena of nature, which play a vital role in physical sciences, such as inverse scattering scheme [9], Bäcklund transform method [10], homogeneous balance scheme [11], Painlevé expansion [12], sine–cosine method, Darboux transformation, Lie group analysis, mapping method and extended mapping method [13,14], Exp-function method [15], rational expansion method [16], Adomian decomposition method [17,18], homotopy perturbation method [19], homotopy analysis method [20], differential transform method, reduced differential method, tanh–coth method [22–24], simplified Hirota's method, extended homoclinic test approach [21], transformed rational function method [23], Hirota's bilinear method [25] and many more. In the literature, a variety of suitable methods are adopted to investigate the behavior of the nonlinear equations. The study about solutions, structures, interaction and further properties of soliton abstracts is given much more attention in the recent past. A strong relation is found among the general elliptic equation and most of the existing sub-equations like the Riccati equation, auxiliary equation [27], first kind elliptic equation, and generalized Riccati equation [26], but also helps us to find more and new exact solutions to NPDEs. As a result, some new and more general exact traveling wave solutions are obtained, see also [28–46]. The auxiliary equation method is successfully applied to construct travelling wave solutions of higher order nonlinear Schrödinger (HNLS) equation illustrating the linear and the nonlinear dispersion as well as dissipation effects in monomode fibers [8]. The HNLS model reduces to the integrable nonlinear Schrödinger equation by eliminating the last three expressions. The governing systems are read as: (1) ∂ Φ ∂ z = i ς 1 ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + ς 2 | Φ | 2 Φ + ς 3 ∂ 3 Φ ∂ t 3 + ς 4 ∂ ∂ t | Φ | 2 Φ + ς 5 Φ ∂ ∂ t | Φ | 2 where the coefficients ς j for j =1, 2, 3, 4, 5; are real constants. This article has been devised as follows: in Section 2, the solutions to the HNLS equation is presented while in Section 3, the physical behaviour of the solitons is discussed. In the last Section 4, the conclusions have been drawn. 2 The description of the auxiliary equation method We will briefly present the AEM in the following steps: Step 1. Let us have a general form of nonlinear PDE (2) F ( u , u t , u x , u y , u xx , u yy , … ) = 0 . where F is a polynomial function with respect to the indicated variables. Step 2. The following wave variable is presented to solve (2) (3) u ( x , t ) = F ( ξ ) , The transformations (3) convert the PDE (2) to an ODE (4) O i ( F , F ξ , F ξ ξ , F ξ ξ ξ , … ) , where F = F(ξ) is unknown function. Step 3. The main idea of the auxiliary equation method based on expanding the traveling wave solution F(ξ) of Eqs. (4) as a finite series (5) F ( ξ ) = ∑ i = 0 n a i ψ i ( ξ ) , ψ satisfies (6) d ψ d ξ = C 0 + C 1 ψ ( ξ ) + C 2 ψ 2 ( ξ ) + C 3 ψ 3 ( ξ ) + C 4 ψ 4 ( ξ ) , (7) ξ = β ( z + ν t ) where C i (i =0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are constants. Step 4. Applying the homogenous balance to (2), the parameters n in (5) can be obtained. Step 5. Substituting (5), (6) and (7) in (2) and collecting the coefficients of ψ j ψ (k), then solving the system for C i . Step 6. Substituting C i and ψ(ξ) obtained in step 5 into (5), to obtain the solutions for (1). 3 Solitons for higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation In order to extract optical solitons, one may have the following starting hypothesis, the wave profile is split into amplitude and phase components, respectively, as (8) Φ ( z , t ) = e i ψ Ω ( ξ ) , where ξ = β ( ν t + z ) , The Ω(ξ) is the amplitude components of the wave profiles, while the phase factor is given by (9) ψ = k z + ω t + θ , where k, ω and θ represent the frequency of the solitons, the wave number and the phase constant respectively.

Figs. 1–3 illustrate the optical solutions produced in Case I for C 4 =0, whereas Figs. 4 and 5 describes the optical solutions produced in Case II for C 3 =0, C 4 =0. Similarly Figs. 6–8 represents the optical solutions produced in Case III for C 0 =0, C 4 =0, while Figs. 9–11 visualizes the optical solutions produced in Case IV for C 0 =0, C 2 =0, C 4 =0. 5 Conclusion In this study, the soliton solutions to the higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation have been extracted. It is observed that the auxiliary equation method is one of the most powerful tools to find a variety of analytical solutions for more complex problems. A sort of new traveling wave solutions are observed to analyse the propagation of short light pulses in an optical fiber, depending on the real parameters, see Figs. 1–11. These results are very auspicious for further investigation and stances on a strong basis for the solution of NPDEs. "," [1] M. Gedalin T.C. Scott Y.B.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.100,Structures and nonlinear optical properties of alkali atom/superalkali doped pyridinic vacancy graphene,"Abstract A new series of alkali atom/superalkali doped pyridinic vacancy graphene, M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene (M=Li, Na, K), have been theoretically designed and investigated by means of density function theory. It is revealed that all M/pyridinic vacancy graphene compounds can present high NLO with considerable first hyperpolarizability in the range of 7923–8523au. Moreover, it is found that employing the concept of superalkali unit M3O as the source of the electron can significantly increase the first hyperpolarizability than doping alkali atom. The results show that M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene exhibit the larger first hyperpolarizability (12199–16553au), which can be attributed to the lower transition energies. Especially, heavier superalkali can be more powerful in increasing the first hyperpolarizabilities of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene. Therefore, M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene are expected to be potential candidates for NLO materials. We hope that this study could provide a new idea for designing nonlinear optical materials using superalkali clusters.",Feb-18," Keywords Pyridinic vacancy graphene Superalkali First hyperpolarizability, 1 Introduction Over the past twenty years, continuous studies have been carried out to design the novel high-performance nonlinear materials with large first hyperpolarizability because of potential applications in many areas such as optical information processing and optical computing [1–4]. Up to now, scientists proposed different strategies to construct excellent NLO materials with considerable NLO responses. For example, prolonged π-electron molecules [5,6], distorted π-electron molecules [7], donor-π bridge-acceptor framework [8–10], the metal-ligand structures [11–13], octupolar molecules [14,15]. In previous work, it was revealed that alkali atom doping on complexants can bring about a large nonlinear optical response, where loosely bound excess electrons is decisive factor in increasing the first hyperpolarizability value. Using this effective approach, several new kinds of excess electron compounds were successfully designed as a candidate for exhibiting large first hyperpolarizability [16–24]. For example, the interaction between Li atom and a fluorocarbon chain lead to excellent NLO materials. The calculated result indicate that the LinH-(CF2-CH2)3-H can exhibit large first hyperpolarizability up to76978au, which is dramatically larger than that of undoped fluorocarbon chain. The analysis of NBO as well as molecular orbital indicate valence electron of alkali atom is pulled out by complexant, forming new electrides [18]. By doping two Na atoms into pyridazine, the compounds can also present considerable first hyperpolarizabilities up to 1.5×104 au, which can be considered as a new type of electride because of containing diffuse excess electrons [19]. Moreover, previous study have shown that a number of complexants were used to construct new electrides, including π-conjugated aromatic ring [25,26], all-metal polyanions [27], multicage [28], graphenes [29], nanotubes [30,31]. Such as, He et al. proposed a new concept, which is the all-metal electride [27]. It is found that the all-metal polyanion pushes the valence of the Ca atoms to form excess electrons, which bring about large first hyperpolarizability. Liu et al. investigated the interaction of k atom with multicage and found that multicage strategy is effective to increase first hyperpolarizability [28]. Superalkali [29], which is a dominant subset of superatoms [30,31], exhibits much lower ionization potentials than that of alkali atom. Compared with alkali atom, Superalkali can donate one electron to the complexants more easily. It has been proved that superalkali cluster as building block was successfully used to design new kinds of compounds with large NLO responses [32–35]. In this paper, we intend to design of novel NLO materials by introducing alkali atom/superalkali cluster into pyridinic vacancy graphene, in which alkali atom/superalkali cluster provide electronic (See Fig. 1 ). We mainly focus on the following questions. (1) How does alkali atom/superalkali cluster affect the electronic property of pyridinic vacancy graphene? (2) How does alkali atom/superalkali cluster affect the absorption spectrum of pyridinic vacancy graphene? (3) How does alkali atom/superalkali cluster affect the first hyperpolarizability of pyridinic vacancy graphene? (4) Are the first hyperpolarizability of the compound rely on the alkali atomic number (Li, Na, K). In order to clarify these questions, we study the equilibrium geometries, electronic property, absorption spectrum and nonlinear optical responses of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene (M=Li, Na, K). We expect that such a theoretical study can provide helpful information for further experimental studies about nonlinear optical materials of pyridinic vacancy graphene. 2 Computational details The geometric structures of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene (M=Li, Na, K) were optimized using the M062X method with the 6-31+G(d, p) basis set. In order to confirm whether geometric structures is minima in global scope, frequency analysis were carried out at the same level. The polarizability (α0) is defined as follows: (1) α 0 = 1 3 ( α x x + α y y + α z z ) The first hyperpolarizability is obtained as (2) β 0 =(β x 2 + β y 2 + β z 2)1/2 In which β i = 3 5 ( β i i i + β i j j + β i k k ) , i , j , k = x , y , z The first hyperpolarizability of system were calculared by a finite-field approach in this work. It is of greatest importance to calculate the (hyper)polarizability by employing the appropriate method. BhandHLYP includes higher percentages of HF exchange than the B3LYP, which reproduce the MP2 result. CAM-B3LYP was proposed by Yanai et al., which is a new Coulomb-attenuated hybrid exchange-correlation functional. The method dependence was tested in this work. The first hyperpolarizability of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene (M=Li, Na, K) were calculated by BhandHLYP and CAM-B3LYP methods. From Table 1 , the two methods give a similar result. So, BhandHLYP was chosen for the materials investigation. The crucial transition energies were calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Electronic properties, including density of states (DOS), the energy of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), were calculated at M062X/6-31+G(d, p) level. Natural bond orbital (NBO) was calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d, p). All of the calculations are carried out by using the GAUSSIAN 09 program package [36]. The density of states (DOS) results were conducted by using Multiwfn 3.3.7 software [37]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Equilibrium geometries and natural bond orbital charges Alkali atom/superalkali cluster added to pyridinic vacancy graphene, over the center of three nitrogen atoms, were systematically investigated using density functional method. Six geometrical structures without imaginary frequency were obtained at the M062X/6-31+G(d, p) level. The molecules system were classified into two groups by the differently doping patterns and were labeled as M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene (M=Li, Na, K). The six structures were given in Fig. 2 . The molecular geometry parameters are listed in Table 2 . The Alkali-N bond length of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene are defined the MN bond length (see Fig. 3 ). The bond length change in the order of Li-3NG<Na-3NG<K-3NG. Among structures, the bond length of K-3NG is largest, which is larger by about 0.784–0.815Å than that of Li/pyridinic vacancy graphene and Na/pyridinic vacancy graphene. The results indicate that the MN bond length of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene increase with increasing atomic radii. Similarly, MN bond length of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene change in the order of Li3O/3NG < Na3O/3NG < K3O/3NG. In addition, The MN bond length of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene is larger than that of corresponding MN bond length of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene. For example. 1.956Å (Li3O/3NG)>1.829Å (Li/3NG). The natural bond orbital (NBO) charges of the compounds are displayed in Table 3 . When alkali atom is introduced to pyridinic vacancy graphene, q(Li+) values of Li/pyridinic vacancy graphene, Na/pyridinic vacancy graphene, K/pyridinic vacancy graphene are 0.706, 0.894, 0.946, respectively. The charge on Li, Na and K enhance with increase of atomic number. Similarly, when superalkali unit M3O is doped into pyridinic vacancy graphene, q(M3O+) values of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene also enhance with increasing atomic number of alkali atom. The results indicate that doping alkali atom and superalkali unit M3O can cause the occurrence of charge transfer from alkali atom/superalkali cluster to pyridinic vacancy graphene, which are beneficial to obtained large first hyperpolarizability. 3.2 Electronic structures and absorption spectra The electronic structures of the compounds were calculated at M062X/6-31+G(d, p) level and the results are given in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . As shown in Table 3, when alkali atom is introduced to pyridinic vacancy graphene, the energy gaps Egap between HOMO and LUMO of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene are found to be 2.323ev for Li/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.323ev for Na/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.308 ev for K/pyridinic vacancy graphene, respectivly. When superalkali unit M3O is doped into pyridinic vacancy graphene, the energy gaps Egap between HOMO and LUMO of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene are found to be 2.313ev for Li3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.289ev for Na3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.269ev for K3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, respectively. The results show that the effect of Alkali atom/superalkali cluster on the gap is not obvious. The absorption spectra were calculated using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311+G (d) level of theory. The absorption spectra of the compounds have been plotted in Fig. 6 . It is shown that the maximum absorption wavelengths of compounds Li/3NG, Na/3NG, and K/3NG are in the visible spectral region, at 533.74, 546.62, and 559.93nm, respectively. From Fig. 6, for compounds Li3O/3NG, Na3O/3NG, K3O/3NG, the maximum absorption wavelengths change in the order of Li3O/3NG<Na3O/3NG<K3O/3NG. Among structures, the maximum absorption wavelength of K3O/3NG is largest in contrast to other compounds. Especially, all compounds are transparent in the deep-ultraviolet spectrum range, which is of great importance in practice. 3.3 Linear and nonlinear optical properties The polarizabilities of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene compounds were obtained at BhandHLYP/6-31+G (d) level and the results are given in Table 4 . When alkali atom is introduced to pyridinic vacancy graphene, the polarizabilities of the compounds are 899, 904, 913au, respectively. When superalkali unit M3O is introduced to pyridinic vacancy graphene, the polarizabilities of the compounds are 919, 943, 969au, respectively. Through the analysis of the above data, it is clear that alkali atom/superalkali cluster doped effect on the polarizability is not great. In this work, we focus on how to build excellent nonlinear optical material by means of interaction between alkali atom/superalkali cluster and 3N-doped graphen. It is previously reported that N atoms with long pair are able to polarize the alkali atom to form an excess electron, leading to improvement of first hyperpolarizability, suggesting the great potential of this material for future applications as nonlinear optical materials. In this work, M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene compounds are designed for the first time. We look forward to these compounds possessing large NLO response. The dependence of first hyperpolarizabilities on atomic number is illustrated and the results are obtained from Table 4. First of all, when alkali atom is introduced to 3N-doped graphen, first hyperpolarizabilities of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene is 8523au for Li/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 8038au for Na/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 7923au for K/pyridinic vacancy graphene, respectivly. In other words, these compounds increase in the order of K/pyridinic vacancy graphene < Na/pyridinic vacancy graphene < Li/pyridinic vacancy graphene, which exhibit large first hyperpolarizability. In order to enhance first hyperpolarizability, we construct new nonlinear optical materials using superalkali unit M3O with a smaller vertical detachment energy value as the source of the electrons. The results are given in Table 4. When superalkali unit M3O is doped into pyridinic vacancy graphene, two interesting results are found. (1) The first hyperpolarizabilities of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene are larger than that of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene. For example, 8523au (Li/pyridinic vacancy graphene) <12199au (Li3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene). (2) In order to investigate the dependence of nonlinear optical property on atom number, we compared first hyperpolarizabilities of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene. The first hyperpolarizabilities of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene increase in the order of 12199au (Li3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene) <15910au (Na3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene) <16553au (K3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene), which indicates that superalkali unit M3O adsorption on pyridinic vacancy graphene enhance the first hyperpolarizabilities with increasing atomic radii. Among these structures, the largest first hyperpolarizabilities are found to be 16553au, which is close to that of Li+(calix[4]pyrrole)K− [38], which is famous alkalide compound with the cuplike complexant. To understand the origin of the large first hyperpolarizabilities of these compounds, two-level model is widely employed [39–41]. (3) β 0 ∝ Δ μ ⋅ f 0 Δ E 3 Where ΔE, f0 and Δμ are, respectively, the transition energy, oscillator strength, and the difference in dipole moment between the ground state and the most relevant excited state. The third power of the transition energy is inversely proportional to the β 0 value. Therefore, the transition energy is the decisive factor in calculation of the β 0 value. The transition energies ( Δ E ) of these compounds were calculated by the TDDFT method (B3LYP/6-311+G (d)) and the corresponding results are listed in Table 4. From Table 4 the ΔE values of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene are 2.323ev for Li/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.268ev for Na/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.214ev for K/pyridinic vacancy graphene, respectively. We also discuss the trend of first hyperpolarizabilities of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene using two-level model. The results are listed in Table 4. From Fig. 7 , the ΔE values of M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene are 2.250ev for Li3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.201ev for Na3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, 2.148ev for K3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, respectively. The ΔE value decreases in the order of 2.148 ev (K3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene) <2.201ev (Na3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene) <2.250 ev (Li3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, which is opposite to the order of 12199au (Li3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene) <15910au (Na3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene) <16553au (K3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene). It is obvious that transition energy values provide a good explanation for the variation in first hyperpolarizability values. To further study the electronic properties of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, the density of states (DOS) for M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene were calculated and are given in Fig. 8 . From Fig. 8, it is found that energy gap of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene is similar when alkali are introduced into pyridinic vacancy graphene. The result indicate that Alkali atom contribution to HOMO is not seen. However, M3O segment contribution to HOMO is obvious, which may lead to small transition energy. 4 Conclusions A series of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene and M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene have been theoretically designed and investigated by means of density function theory. Doping alkali atom can cause considerably large first hyperpolarizabilities, which range from 2011 to 8524au. When alkali atom is introduced into pyridinic vacancy graphene, employing the K atom can more effectively enhance the first hyperpolarizability of M/pyridinic vacancy graphene (M=Li, Na, K) compounds. In contrast to M/pyridinic vacancy graphene, M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene (M=Li, Na, K) show larger first hyperpolarizabilities. Among M3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene compounds, the largest first hyperpolarizability are found to be 16553au for K3O/pyridinic vacancy graphene, which is about 2 times larger than that of K/pyridinic vacancy graphene. Clearly, doping the superalkali cluster is advantageous for obtaining excellent nonlinear optical materials. It is our expectation that the present work may give new knowledge about designing NLO material based on superalkali cluster.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.09.072,A method for optimising settings of colour primaries for wide colour gamut displays,"Abstract Recently, wide colour gamut displays which adopt highly saturated primaries of red, green, blue have been rapidly applied. These displays can evoke more vivid and more pleasing effects for images. However, images shown on these newly developing wide gamut devices cannot achieve preferred quality under the control of conventional signal standards that are developed based on smaller colour gamut. To achieve the preferred display effects on wide gamut devices in digital image reproduction, a whole procedure to optimise gamut settings of colour primaries were proposed, in which particular algorithms were designed to render images from signal standard such as sRGB via simulating various gamut settings on the given display. Thus, the optimum specifications of colour primaries can be determined by calculations of the proposed preference index. Furthermore, a psychophysical experiment along with a detailed discussion were carried out as a verification, in which the consistence between the preference index calculation and the visual data could certify the effectiveness of the proposed procedure and algorithms. This study may help display researchers and manufactories by supporting some recommendations to determine the primaries of wide gamut devices in applications.",Feb-18," Keywords Colour reproduction Colour rendering Colour gamut Displays 1 Introduction Wide colour gamut is an advantage to evoke more vivid and more pleasing images for different displays including desktop monitors, TVs (televisions), tablet computers, and smart phones [1]. Recently, various display technologies [2,3] have been raised to produce highly saturated primaries of red, green, blue. However, the conventional broadcasting standards such as PAL (phase alteration line) and NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) are based on smaller colour gamut, as well as the sRGB (it means standard red green blue colour space) system [4] widely used in the display industry. Consequently, when images are displayed on wide gamut devices according to these standard signals without additional processing, the mismatch of their gamut would cause unavoidable colour distortions by introducing oversaturated, unpleasant effects [5]. The reason is that, both naturalness and colourfulness are key factors to influence the perceptual quality in image colour reproduction, but they show contradictions in some situations [6,7]. The perceptual image quality will firstly be improved gradually with the increase of colourfulness and then be suffered from the over-colourful situation, which is due to poor effect of naturalness in that case [8,9]. Though wider gamut is acceptable or even preferable for representing outdoor scene images to show more colourful sky, flowers, grass, but it may fail for reproducing some familiar colours such as skin [10,11]. In pace with the spread uses of wide gamut devices, a series of researches were concentrated on discussing the correlations between gamut features and image effects [12,13], and revealing how to calculate gamut parameters such as size and boundaries [14–16], which built a good foundation in this field. Therefrom, some approaches should be put forward to deal with the mismatch between wide gamut displays and current standards. At present, new signal standards based on wider colour gamut appears accordingly, such as the ITU-R (International Telecommunications Union-Radiocommunications Sector) BT. 2020 and the SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) for highly developed TVs [17,18]. New signal standards can solve the problem in some degree. However, there are various display technologies, which make different displays from such a many manufactories show large diversities on their colour gamut features, so that employing one universal standard to suit those different displays will still cause image distortions. To resolve the problem in terms of principles, quite a few scholars endeavored in introducing some treatments on images or displays, which were aimed to achieve preferred image quality under the control of existed signal standards. For pretreatment process of images, some researchers made efforts on improving image reproduction effects for specific colour contents, e.g. a procedure to protect skin colours via a content-based analysis on wide gamut displays [19]. Considering content-based algorithms might be complicated and unstable in applications, more studies were focused on designing colour conversion schemes with pertinence for different wide gamut devices rather than for image contents, e.g. based on multi-channel technology which supported a way of enlarging colour gamut. For multi-channel displays with several pixel combinations such as RGBY (red, green, blue, yellow), RGBCY (red, green, blue, cyan, yellow), RGBCW (red, green, blue, cyan, white), RGBW (red, green, blue, white), the algorithms for converting traditional RGB (red, green, blue) signals were proposed accordingly [20–22], whereas similar works were carried out on TVs with RGB primaries [23]. Also, methods of determining gamut boundary or optimising between brightness and gamut were deeply discussed [24,25]. In the field of pretreatment procedure on displays, this study concentrated on optimising settings of colour primary specifications on wide gamut devices, in which an image rendering procedure was designed and a psychophysical experiment was then conducted. Finally the optimum colour primaries was determined to produce preferred colour reproduction for sRGB images. This work may support some recommendations to determine the primaries of wide gamut devices for display researchers and manufactories as an example of application. 2 Procedure and algorithms 2.1 Strategy for optimising settings of colour primaries For a given wide gamut display, a procedure for optimising settings of its colour primaries is designed, which can supply a strategy of seeking appropriate gamut settings for different displays. The proposed work flow is described step by step as shown in Fig. 1 . For this wide gamut display, different gamut settings can be obtained within the sRGB gamut and the display maximum gamut by adjusting the positions of its three primaries (red, green, blue) in the CIE1976UCS diagram [26]. To test these new gamut settings, a series of algorithms is put forward to simulate their image display effects on the same display, so that the performances of these gamut settings can be judged by two approaches, i.e. the visual evaluation from psychophysical experiment, and a proposed preference index with particular calculations. Therefore, the optimum gamut settings can be determined based on considering results of the visual evaluation and the preference index. The process and algorithms for simulating the image display effects for individual gamut settings on this given display are depicted in detail in the following. 2.2 Image simulation of different gamut settings An image processing procedure is established to search for the optimum chromaticity coordinates of the three primaries by adjusting their positions in the CIE1976UCS diagram. For each determined gamut setting, we assume that it can be regarded as an “imaginative” device, and Fig. 1 shows the methods of accurately simulating the visual effect for each “imaginative” device on the same display with the same setting. When images are shown on the “imaginative” device, the visual effect for each pixel can be simulated based on the physical and colorimetric settings of the display, such as peak luminance and chromaticity coordinates of three primaries. For the test gamut setting of this “imaginative” device, the CIE1976UCS u'v' coordinates of red, green, blue primaries are denoted as (u' R, v' R), (u' G, v' G), (u' B, v' B). Whereas for the display maximum gamut, the u'v' coordinates of three primaries are marked as (u' R0, v' R0), (u' G0, v' G0), (u' B0, v' B0), and their peak luminance values are Y R0, Y G0, Y B0, respectively. According to the basic colorimetry [26,27], the coordinates (u' R, v' R), (u' G, v' G), (u' B, v' B) are transformed to corresponding tristimulus values, i.e. (X RT, Y RT, Z RT), (X GT, Y GT, Z GT), (X BT, Y BT, Z BT), and Eq. (1) shows the calculation of obtaining tristimulus values for the three primaries, where J=R, G, B. (1) { X JT = 9 Y JT ⋅ u ' J / 4 v ' J Y JT = Y J0 Z JT = ( 9 Y JT / v ' J − X JT − 15 Y JT ) / 3 For different settings of the display, the CCT (correlated colour temperature) parameter is fixed with definitized u'v' coordinates (u' CCT, v' CCT), such as 6500K. To maintain the same CCT for different gamut settings, the white point (X W, Y W, Z W) as the sum of the tristimulus values of three primaries should be in accord with the (u' CCT, v' CCT) [26], and calculations of getting (u' CCT, v' CCT) from (X W, Y W, Z W) are expressed in Eqs. (2) and (3). (2) { X W = X RT + X GT + X BT Y W = Y RT + Y GT + Y BT Z W = Z RT + Z GT + Z BT (3) { u ' CCT = 4 X W X W + 15 Y W + 3 Z W v ' CCT = 9 Y W X W + 15 Y W + 3 Z W Afterwards, by solving Eqs. (1)–(3), three coefficients of t 1, t 2, and t 3 are given, as depicted in Eqs. (4)–(6), which are employed to develop the corresponding scaling factors of modulating the current luminance values of the three primaries, i.e. Y RT, Y GT, Y BT. (4) { a 1 = 4 X RT − u ' CCT ⋅ ( X RT + 15 Y RT + 3 Z RT ) a 2 = 4 X GT − u ' CCT ⋅ ( X GT + 15 Y GT + 3 Z GT ) a 3 = u ' CCT ⋅ ( − 3 X BT + 15 Y BT + 3 Z BT ) (5) { b 1 = 9 Y RT − v ' CCT ⋅ ( X RT + 15 Y RT + 3 Z RT ) b 2 = 9 Y GT − v ' CCT ⋅ ( X GT + 15 Y GT + 3 Z GT ) b 3 = v ' CCT ⋅ ( X BT + 6 Y BT + 3 Z BT ) (6) { t 1 = ( a 3 ⋅ b 1 − a 1 ⋅ b 3 ) / ( a 2 ⋅ b 1 − a 1 ⋅ b 2 ) t 2 = ( a 3 ⋅ b 2 − a 2 ⋅ b 3 ) / ( a 1 ⋅ b 2 − a 2 ⋅ b 1 ) t 3 = 1 Considering the solved luminance values Y RT, Y GT, Y BT may exceed the display’s peak luminance values Y R0, Y G0, Y B0 for each primary, which will cause display aberration in applications. Therefore, new scaling factors β R, β G, β B are proposed from the coefficients of t 1, t 2, and t 3 for three primaries, which are listed in Table 1 , in order to get suitable luminance values Y R, Y G, Y B in practice. And Eq. (7) shows the process to obtain the tristimulus values of three primaries on the “imaginative” device, i.e. (X R, Y R, Z R), (X G, Y G, Z G), and (X B, Y B, Z B), where K = X, Y, Z. (7) { K R = β R ⋅ K RT K G = β G ⋅ K GT K B = β B ⋅ K BT Based on the colorimetric parameters of the “imaginative” device, the device-independent information of each pixel can be transformed to the device-dependent RGB space. As shown in Fig. 1, for any digital inputs (r o, g o, b o), their corresponding tristimulus values (X c, Y c, Z c) can be calculated via the forward chromatic characterization [28]. The typical chromatic characterization methods include the GOG (gain-offset-gamma) model, the PLCC (piecewise linear interpolation assuming constant chromaticity coordinates) model, and the PLVC (piecewise linear interpolation assuming variable chromaticity coordinates) model, etc [28–30]. For most displays with good performance on channel independence, the prediction from (r o, g o, b o) to (X c, Y c, Z c) are shown in Eqs. (8) and (9), where Qc is the forward transformation matrix derived from the given gamut setting, and X (0,0,0), Y (0,0,0), Z(0,0,0) stand for the tristimulus values when all the primaries of the display are off. In addition, for displays with poor channel independence, particular chromatic characterization methods will be employed [31]. The relationships between the intermediate variables L R(r o), L G(g o), L B(b o) and (r o, g o, b o) could be fitted by different expressions, and Eq. (10) gives an example of GOG model [29], in which τ R, τ G, τ B, αR, αG, αB, γ R, γ G, γ B are device-dependent parameters determined by the u'v' coordinates and the peak luminance of three primaries with one given gamut setting, and N is the number of bits for each primary to record colour information, usually N =8. (8) Q C = [ X R X G X B Y R Y G Y B Z R Z G Z B ] (9) [ X C Y C Z C ] = Q C [ L R ( r O ) L G ( g O ) L B ( b O ) ] + [ X ⁡ ( 0 , ⁡ ⁡ 0 ⁡ , ⁡ ⁡ 0 ⁡ ) ⁡ Y ( 0 , ⁡ ⁡ 0 ⁡ , ⁡ ⁡ 0 ⁡ ) Z ( 0 , ⁡ ⁡ 0 ⁡ , ⁡ ⁡ 0 ⁡ ) ] (10) { L R ( r O ) = ( τ R ( r O 2 N − 1 ) + α R ) γ R L G ( g O ) = ( τ G ( g O 2 N − 1 ) + α G ) γ G L B ( b O ) = ( τ B ( b O 2 N − 1 ) + α B ) γ B The tristimulus values (X c, Y c, Z c) can be transformed to colour appearance parameters of lightness J c, chroma C c, and hue h c according to the CIE (Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage) recommended CIECAM02 model [32,33], which has the advantage of involving the observation condition such as surround, background, and observer adaptation state. According to Hunt’s reproduction objective of “equivalent” reproduction [7,34], the original and reproduction should have the same appearance under their respective viewing conditions, which is no longer measured physically but needs to be judged psychovisually. Hence, the to-be-displayed colour appearance coordinates (J m, C m, h m) should be the same or be close to the colour appearance coordinates (J c, C c, h c). Afterwards, the (J m, C m, h m) could be transformed to tristimulus values (X m, Y m, Z m) by considering its observation condition, and then the final digital inputs (r m, g m, b m) are calculated via the inverse chromatic characterization with the transformation matrix Hm , in which the colorimetric parameters of the actually used gamut setting (usually it is the display maximum gamut setting) are employed. Similar to the forward chromatic characterization, Eqs. (11)–(13) depict the corresponding calculations to derive the digital inputs (r m, g m, b m), which are reversible operations of Eqs. (8)–(10).

The procedure of calculating image preference index is demonstrated in Fig. 2 , in which for some appointed pixels, their colour appearance parameters calculated from the current gamut setting are compared with those calculated from the sRGB gamut. Not all the colours are involved in the preference index, the appointed colour samples in this process consider both vivid scenes and natural objects, such as skin, sky, grass, vegetables, and fruits [8,10,34,35]. A series of colour samples is extracted from several typical images, and their digital inputs (r Ai , g Ai , b Ai ) are shown in Table 2 . The selected samples contain some typical memory colours and high-saturated colours that are close to three primaries and their mixtures (cyan, magenta, and yellow), i.e. located near the display gamut boundaries. These 18 samples supply a general recommendation, e.g. skin (sample 1–4), sky (sample 5–6), grass (sample 7–10), vegetables and fruits (sample 9–14), ocean (sample 15–16), and flowers (sample 17–18). In addition, the selection of colour samples may vary in some situations when it is need to put emphasis on particular colours for displays. In Fig. 2, for digital inputs (r Ai , g Ai , b Ai ) of each colour sample, the corresponding tristimulus values (X si , Y si , Z si ) according to the sRGB standard are predicted by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) 61966-2-1 standard [4], where i =1, 2, …, 18. The transformation algorithms are specified and explicit as in Eqs. (14) and (15), according to the rule of sRGB standard. Then, the colour appearance parameters (J si , C si , h si ) for (r Ai , g Ai , b Ai ) under the given environment are calculated from (X si , Y si , Z si ) along with the parameters of observation condition via the CIECAM02 model. (14) { L R ( r A i ) ⁡ = ⁡ ⁡ ( ( r A i 255 + 0.055 ) / 1.055 ) 2.4 L G ( g A i ) ⁡ ⁡ = ⁡ ⁡ ⁡ ⁡ ( ( g A i 255 + 0.055 ) / 1.055 ) 2.4 L B ( b A i ) ⁡ ⁡ ⁡ = ⁡ ⁡ ⁡ ( ( b A i 255 + 0.055 ) / 1.055 ) 2.4 (15) [ X S i Y S i Z S i ] = [ 0.4124 0.3576 0.1805 0.2126 0.7152 0.0722 0.0193 0.1192 0.9505 ] [ L R ( r ⁡ A i ) ⋅ 80 L G ( g A i ) ⋅ 80 L B ( b ⁡ A i ) ⋅ 80 ] Besides, for each colour sample, the tristimulus values (X mi, Y mi, Z mi) and the colour appearance parameters (J mi, C mi, h mi) under the current test gamut settings are obtained from (r Ai, g Ai, b Ai) by calculations of Eqs. (8)–(13). Afterwards, for all the samples, the preference index can be derived from comparing the colour appearance parameters between the sRGB gamut and the current test gamut setting. The design of the algorithm is on account of some literature results and our previous studies [6–10,35], e.g. hue is the most important factor in memory colour evaluation, and for most colours including memory colours such as trees, sky, and grass, their visual effects in one gamut setting will be preferred by observers when they are exhibited more saturated and more vivid than the effects under the sRGB specification. However, extremely saturated colours may cause uncomfortable feelings especially for skin colours, thus their visual effects should not be oversaturated, that is to say, the reproduction close to the original colour appearance will be preferable. Therefore, two criteria are followed in predicting preference index based on the appearance differences between the sRGB gamut and the current gamut. Firstly, the hue deviation for all colour samples (samples 1–18) and the chroma deviation for skin colour samples (samples 1–4) will cause a decrease of preference index. Secondly, the higher values of lightness J mi for all colour samples and the higher values of chroma C mi for the colour samples except skin colours (samples 5–18) may result in a rise of preference index. The method of representing the preference index “PI” is shown in Eq. (16), here, in applications the recommended values are Q =120, μ 1 =0.228, μ 2 =0.394, μ 3 =0.148, and μ 4 =0.076, which are gained from multiple linear regression of experimental data. (16) P I = Q − μ 1 ∑ i = 1 18 | h m i − h s i | − μ 2 ∑ i = 1 4 | C m i − C s i | + μ 3 ∑ i = 1 18 ( J m i − J s i ) + μ 4 ∑ i = 5 18 ( C m i − C s i ) 3 Psychophysical experiment Visual evaluation is another approach to compare the performances of different gamut settings, which should be in accord with the results of calculating the preference index. To test the effectiveness of the above process and to supply more information of optimising the values of Q, μ 1, μ 2, μ 3, and μ 4 in Eq. (16), a wide gamut display was employed in a psychophysical experiment, so that the display effects for different gamut settings could be evaluated and compared with the proposed preference index by analyzing the visual data. 3.1 Test display and image preparation A 24inch wide gamut LCD (liquid crystal display) with LED (light emitting diode) backlight was adopted, which has a gamut to cover sRGB, Adobe RGB, etc. Its physical parameters are listed in Table 3 , including the settings of peak luminance, CCT, and the u'v' coordinates of three primaries, as well as some basic parameters such as size and resolution. The physical measurement of the display was conducted using a Konica-Minolta CS-2000 tele-spectroradiometer according to IEC 61966-4 standard [36]. Fig. 3 illustrates the gamut visualization for the display with comparison to some image standards, in 2D (two dimensional) form of CIE1976UCS diagram and in 3D (three dimensional) form of CIELAB colour space respectively. The sRGB gamut has lower lightness values than the display gamut since they adopted the same white point when being converted to CIEL*a*b* values. Clearly shown in Fig. 3, the display exhibits its significantly wide gamut, stating it is competent for simulating various gamut settings in a free range. On the basis of the large gamut of this display, the new positions of three primaries could be adjusted within the region between sRGB gamut and the display maximum gamut in the CIE1976UCS diagram. Thus, for each primary, different amount of u'v' coordinates (Nr, Ng, Nb for red, green, blue primaries respectively) were chosen as new specifications, resulting in a total of Nr ×Ng ×Nb gamut settings. Based on the consideration that too small variations between two neighboring gamut settings may not be visually distinguishable, Nr ×Ng ×Nb was set as 8×5×4 in the experiment. The selection of u'v' coordinates for each channel adhered to two principles. Firstly, these plots should cover a certain range of variations from the sRGB gamut to the test display gamut boundaries. Secondly, they should be located in a well-distributed spread. Fig. 4 depicts the adjusted positions for the three primaries respectively. To judge the image reproduction effects of each gamut setting, the source images containing all the 18 colour samples in Table 2 were regarded as original test images. Then their corresponding images were generated to simulate the display effects on each “imaginative” device with the given gamut setting, according to the process of “Section 2.2”. In the image simulation process, the GOG model was adopted which achieved high accuracies of 0.49 and 0.56 ΔE00 units [37] in the forward and the inverse colorimetric characterization respectively (using 100 colours with random digital inputs as test samples), so that the outputs of the display could be accurately controlled. By implementing the procedure, 30 primary specifications from the 8×5×4 combinations were determined by a pilot visual assessment. Therefore, 30 rendered versions were prepared for each original test image. These gamut settings also included the display maximum gamut and the sRGB gamut, so the other 28 gamut settings could be compared with these two special "," 3.2 Psychophysical procedure A psychophysical experiment was put into practice to verify which gamut settings could produce the preferred colour reproduction for images from sRGB standard. The visual experiment was conducted in a dark room, and a panel of 10 observers (5 male and 5 female) participated. All the images were resized to the same resolution of 960×600 pixels, and the remaining part of the screen was set as neutral gray with 18% peak luminance. Thereby, the viewing angle was 18.4°×11.5° at a distance of 80cm, and the observers focused their attentions on the display perpendicularly. Since the visual effect was a major consideration for consumers in the display industry, the attribute of image preference was taken into account, which was defined as the extent of the image quality being preferred by observers [6,9]. This attribute was assessed via the psychophysical scaling method of categorical judgment [35,38], since this technique has the advantage of allowing direct responses of the observer to variations in the stimulus. In this method, a seven-point scale was adopted to describe perceptual feelings in grades, where grade “7” corresponded to the “highest imaginable preference”, and grade “1” to the “least imaginable preference”. The procedure of the psychophysical experiment is as follows, and then massive visual judgments were obtained. a) To test whether the observer has normal colour vision. b) To show the observer a detailed instruction, both in English and in Chinese, to help him/her to understand the visual task. c) To perform two-minute dark adaptation and one-minute light adaptation. d) To present one version of one original image on the display to the observer and record his/her judgment via a software interface controlled by a specially designed program. e) To repeat the step d) with another version of the same image until all its 30 versions were evaluated. The sequence of these versions shown to observers was randomly generated. f) To change to another original test image, and repeat the steps d) and e). The sequence of the 8 original images shown on the display was also random. When the evaluations of all the images were finished, one session was completed for one observer. g) To repeat the above sessions for all the observers. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Deriving equal-interval scale values The raw experimental data assigned by observers are not equal-interval scale values (equal-interval scale means equal distances anywhere along the scale represent the same significance) but just category names. Hence, these raw category names were converted to equal-interval scale values by adopting Case V of Thurstone’s law on comparative judgment. Firstly, the raw category grades were converted to a frequency matrix, denoting the amount of individual category grade judged by the observers, then its cumulative frequency matrix could be obtained by calculating the cumulative sum of the above frequency values. Afterward, a cumulative probability matrix was calculated from the cumulative frequency matrix via being divided by the number of total judgments, so that it was converted to a z-score matrix according to the inverse function of standard normal cumulative distribution [39]. Finally, the ultimate equal-interval scale values from categorical judgment method could be derived from a difference matrix and a matrix of category boundary estimates, which were both calculated from the z-score matrix. Therefore, for each evaluated image version, its categorical grades judged by all the observers were converted to an equal-interval scale value. The derived equal-interval scale values could be used to determine which colour gamut could produce preferred colour reproduction effect for images from sRGB standard, by which the 30 evaluated gamut settings can be analyzed and compared. Herewith, Table 4 lists the equal-interval scale values of each primary specifications (according to the descend order), along with the u'v' coordinates for each colour primary. The parameter “gamut area ratio to sRGB gamut” as an indicator of gamut size was calculated by performing an operation of division, i.e. the triangle area of the current gamut divided by the triangle area of the sRGB gamut in the CIE1976UCS diagram. 4.2 Analyzing the visual data To deeply analyze the data in Table 4, a comparison is implemented involving the gamut ratio and the preference index which are calculated from the current gamut setting, and Fig. 5 exhibits the tendency of the gamut ratio and the preference index with variation of equal-interval scale values. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5, the more preferred gamut settings with higher equal-interval scale values do not have high values of gamut ratio, and there are no consistence between the gamut size and the performance of gamut settings, the low Pearson correlation coefficient r value of −0.1043 implies that expanding the gamut tenaciously for display devices is not an advisable way to achieve pleasing visual effects, instead, appropriate settings of primary specifications are more significant and functional. As for the preference index, it can be seen that, there is obvious linear dependence between the results of psychophysical evaluation and the preference index prediction, the high value of Pearson correlation coefficient r 0.8319 states the reasonableness of the proposed procedure and algorithms for image simulation. Moreover, the accuracy of Eq. (16) is verified. Hence, in the display industry, the settings of colour primaries can be optimised for wide colour gamut displays via the realization of the image simulation and the preference index calculation. 5 Conclusions In this study, a whole procedure for optimising settings of colour primaries was presented for wide gamut displays, in order to achieve visually preferred appearance for images from the signal standards such as sRGB. An image processing procedure was developed to simulate image display effects for different gamut settings with specified colour coordinates of the three primaries. Then the visual effects of different gamut settings were predicted and compared by calculation of the preference index, thus the preferred gamut settings for optimum image reproduction could be determined. Moreover, a wide gamut display was employed as an experimental verification, by which the results of the preference index for 30 gamut settings were compared with their corresponding data of visual assessments. The consistence between the preference index calculation and the data derived from psychophysical experiment certified the effectiveness of the proposed procedure and its accessary algorithms. In conclusion, the preferred gamut settings are not close to the maximum gamut of the display, whereas suitable colour appearance parameters are more important for obtaining preferred colour reproduction effects for wide gamut displays. Our further studies may focus on investigating methods to adjust images from different signal standards adaptively, aiming to show a preferred visual effect on wide gamut displays with given primary specifications.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.111,Investigation the phase transformation of sputtered molybdenum oxide thin films and their correlation with the film thickness,Abstract Polycrystalline of as-deposited molybdenum oxide thin films were synthesized using Radio-Frequency sputtering technique. X-ray diffraction technique showed the formation of hexagonal MoO3 beside the β-MoO3 phase for thin films of thickness 39nm. The higher film thickness at about 132nm showed the new tetragonal phase of molybdenum oxide MoO2 beside the β- phase. The film morphology and roughness were observed by Atomic Force Microscopy which approved that the roughness was observed to decrease as the film thickness increase. Optical properties of the sputtered films were examined by UV-visible spectral measurements. The optical band gap values are varied from 3.74eV for lower film thickness to 3.8eV for higher film thickness. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded for the studied films showing the spectral broadness in the range 350–600nm related to near band edge emission and a red emission is observed at 725nm.,Feb-18," Keywords Nanostructured thin films X-ray Diffraction Atomic Force Microscopy Optical properties photoluminescence 1 Introduction Transition metal oxides (TMOs) attract the researcher’s attention due to their novel technological applications. It shows interesting and promising structure, electrical, magnetic and optical properties due to their different oxidation states. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is one of smart TMOs which are specifically used in smart windows or glasses [1–5]. Moreover, MoO3 can be applied as cathode materials for solid state micro-batteries [6,7] and gas sensors [8–10]. Molybdenum trioxide has different characteristic polymorphic phases [10–12]: a) Stable orthorhombic α-MoO3 phase. b) Metastable monoclinic β-MoO3 phase. c) Open hexagonal ν-MoO3 phase. d) Tetragonal t-MoO2 phase and MoO phase. Molybdite phase has double layers of linked distorted MoO6 octahedra parallel to (010) planes and the successive layers are contacted by weak interlayer forces with easy cleavage along (010) planes [13]. The metastable phase is quite different than the stable phase due to the absence of van der Waals gaps which responsible to form stratified structure [14], i.e. the octahedral units share corners in a distorted cube [14]. The hexagonal phase structure appears like zigzag chains of octahedral units linked at cis-positions [14,15]. Moreover, MoO3 has different morphological structures and the oxidation state of molybdenum is varied from +2 to +6 [11,16]. The present investigation tends to fuller look on molybdenum trioxide phases specially the tetragonal structure by means of different characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence in order to modify and improve the MoO3 structure in the form of thin films. 2 Experimental details MoO x thin films of different thicknesses were syntheses by RF magnetron sputtering (RF Magnetron Sputter System, Syskey Technologies, Taiwan) using high purity target of MoO3 (99.99%), 3inch diameter and 0.6inch thickness on glass substrate and silicon wafer. Silicon wafer is mostly used for obtaining good resolution AFM images rather than glass for reducing the scattered beam on the substrate. Before the deposition process, the substrate slides were sonically cleaned in acetone solution and then dried with nitrogen gas. Table 1 shows the deposition parameter conditions used for the deposition of MoO x thin films and their thicknesses measured by DektakXT (Bruker Germany) surface profiler. The structural investigations were performed using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) type Ultima-IV Rigaku Japan operating at 40kV and 40mA with Cukα radiation (λ=0.154056nm). The surface topography of the sputtered films had examined by atomic force microscope (Omicron-VTA-AFM). The optical spectra were measured by UV-visible spectrometry (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750, USA) form 300–2500nm with a resolution of 1nm. Photoluminescence spectra of the sputtered films were also studied in the wavelength range 350–750nm by Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (RF—5301 PC, Shimadzu, Japan) with an excitation radiation at 350nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 X-ray diffraction investigation Fig. 1 represents the X-ray chart for the sputtered MO-oxide films at different film thicknesses. The lower film thickness at 39nm shows the presence of metastable monoclinic β-MoO3 phase at 2θ=26.36° and hexagonal h-MoO3 phase at 2θ=29.34°, and 56.3°, respectively. Since the specific sputtered films at lower thickness behaves two phases β- and h-MoO3 according to the PDF Card No. 00-037-1445 and 00-021-0569, respectively. By increasing the film thickness to 80nm, the same phases are observed except the peak at 2θ=56.3° disappeared and new tetragonal MoO2 phase is detected (PDF Card No. 00-002-0422). For molybdenum oxide films of thickness higher than 100nm, the hexagonal phase changed to the tetragonal structure beside the metastable phase. Hence β-MoO3 phase is dominated through all films at 2θ≈26.3, and the h-MoO3 phase is also created under the specific experimental sputtering condition. The β- phase is strengthened as the film thickness increases, while the h-phase tends to be modified to the tetragonal structure at high thickness (more than 100nm). In order to understand the formation of MoO2 tetragonal phase from transforming the h-phase to t-phase, Wang et al. [12] reported that the α-MoO3 was converted into tetragonal MoO2 phase by low current density electron beam irradiation, whereas at high current density MoO with rock-salt structure was the final phase. Also they concluded that MoO2 phase is directly related to the rearrangement and the number of MoO6 octahedra [12]. Furthermore, several previous articles approved the existence of tetragonal phase as follows: i Knotek and Feibelman [17] had proposed a mechanism related to desorption of oxygen atoms from the surface involving inter atomic Auger decay process leads to reduce MoO3 to MoO2 structure. ii Superlattice of oxygen vacancies was detected from MoO3 as a result of creation of crystallographic shear planes and MoO2 was formed as tiny crystals from the reduction of MoO3 [18]. iii A new phase of Mo-O with oxidation state lower than Mo+4 has been detected by Su [19]. iv Ressler et al. [20], reported that MoO3 were reduced to MoO2 at temperature below 698K without formation of crystalline intermediate. Based on the previous consideration and the present results, the proposed mechanism has three stages depends on both of the film thickness and the sputtering condition described in the experimental section as follows: i At lower thin film thickness (≤40nm), the β-MoO3 is formed beside h-MoO3, and no reduction is observed. ii At intermediate film thickness (40≤film thickness≤80nm), the crystal structure is improved and the phase of h-MoO3 is reduced into one peak while t-MoO2 will start to grow in expense of h-phase. iii At film thickness higher than 80nm, the β-MoO3 phase is strengthen and the h-phase disappeared and replaced by t-MoO2 structure. Table 2 shows the characteristic peaks, and crystallite size D obtained from the first three XRD peaks by using Scherrer expression ( D = 0.89 λ β cos θ = 0.1371 β cos θ n m ) [21]. 3.2 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigation The topology and the surface roughness of the sputtered films were studied by AFM. 3D images show the variation in the morphology of molybdenum oxide thin films according to their thicknesses as shown in Fig. 2 . For films of thickness ≤40nm, large and medium particles or grains are observed. The average particle size is about 20.4nm and the film roughness is 1.42nm. By increasing the film thickness up to 80nm, medium particles with average grain size is measured to be 20.1nm and the film roughness is reduced to 1.32nm. MoO x film thickness of 132nm has an average grain size around 12.8nm with roughness around 1.05nm. Medium grains with some fine crystals are observed. The morphology of the studied films is observed to be transformed from large grain (at lower thickness with hexagonal major phase) into medium grains (for 80 and 132nm thicknesses with tetragonal major phase). The mainly morphological differences between the medium film thickness of about 80nm and the large thickness at around 132nm are the size of the grains and the number of fine crystals observed at higher thickness. So, there is a reduction in both of roughness and grain size by increasing the film thickness. Hence the film roughness in the present study is strongly affected by two factors the film thickness and the crystalline film phase. At lower film thickness of hexagonal phase as a major phase, the film roughness is high. In the intermediate and the high thickness stage, i.e. at 80 and 132nm thicknesses with tetragonal structure, the film roughness is decreased from 1.42 up to 1.05nm. Also, the number of grains appears to increase rather than the lower thickness. This may be related to the structural changes from lower film thickness to higher thickness (from hexagonal to tetragonal phase as discussed in XRD). Hence, as the film thickness increase, the roughness and the grain size decrease. It is worthy to differentiate between the crystallite size obtained from XRD data and the grain size obtained from AFM or SEM. The crystallite size is specified to determine to size of one specific crystalline phase, while the grain or particle size means the size of the set of crystals or small particles in one grain (boundary). So, both of XRD and AFM agreed that the high sputtered film thickness gives good quality films (due to the decreasing in the film roughness). 3.3 Optical properties of molybdenum oxide thin films 3.3.1 Transmittance, reflectance, and absorption coefficient The investigation of the optical spectra of thin films is necessary for knowing the spectroscopic properties of materials and the important physical parameters such as optical transition, refractive index, dielectric properties, etc. It provides a whole picture about the electronic transition in such materials. The spectral transmittance and reflectance of MoO x thin films are shown in Fig. 3 . It is clearly seen that both of transmittance and reflectance are forced dependent on the film thickness and the major crystalline phase of the film. The presence of h-phase (thickness of 39nm) in such films exhibit high transmittance and low reflectance, while the existence of the t-phase at high film thickness behaves lower transmittance and higher reflectance (thickness of 132nm). The absorption edge of such films tends to shift towards lower photon wavelengths (higher photon energies). Also, the absorption coefficient, α, for the investigated films was estimated from the formula [22]: (1) α = 1 thickness ( cm − 1 ) × ln [ ( 1 − R ) 2 T ] Fig. 4 shows the variation of the absorption coefficient as a function in photon wavelength which tends to decrease as the wavelength increases. This behavior occurs for different reasons such as, internal electric fields within the crystal, deformation of lattice due to strain caused by imperfection, and inelastic scattering of charge carriers by phonons [23]. 3.3.2 Optical band gap determination Optical transition in condensed matter is novel key to study the band structure of such materials especially thin films. The knowing of the type of the electronic transition in any material leads to provide complete data about the electronic states, defects, fermi level state, the state of emitting or absorbing phonon energy, etc. Since, the present investigation proved the crystalline nature of the sputtered films and the direct transition is almost predominated in these films. In general, the optical transition can be represented by Mott and Davis expression [24]: (2) α h υ = B ( h υ − E g ) n where B, is constant, hυ is the photon energy, Eg, represents optical band gap, and n is defined as the exponent parameter which related to the optical transition type. So, the exponent n can take these values ½, 2, 3/2, and 3 for direct allowed, indirect allowed, direct forbidden, and indirect forbidden transition, respectively [25]. For the sputtered MoO x films, the value of the parameter, n, is ½ indicating to the direct transition; i.e. the direct electronic transition between the valence and the conduction band. The determination of the optical band gap value comes from extending the linear part of the curve to the hυ axis at which the value of (ahυ)2 equal zero as shown in Fig. 5 . Hence, the optical band gap varies from 3.74eV for film thickness of 39nm up to 3.8eV for film thickness 132nm, reaching to the high value at 4.06eV for films of 80nm thickness. The variation of the band gap in MoO3 is actually affected by the crystalline nature of the films. The transformation of the hexagonal phase to the tetragonal phase may cause the increasing the optical band gap values. It was reported that molybdenum trioxide thin films of thickness 500nm obtained by electron beam evaporation had an optical band gap varied in the range 3 to 3.7eV as the substrate temperature varied from 100 to 225 °C without detecting the crystalline phases [26]. On the other hand, Jittiarporn et al. [14], reported that chemical precipitations of h-MoO3 thin films have an optical band gap varied from 3.14 to 3.2eV depending on the reaction temperature (55°– 85°C). Also, Lin et al. [27], showed that the value optical band gap of β-MoO3 thin films heated at 300 °C in N2 gasis about 3.93eV, while the values of Eg for polymorph MoO3 films (α- + β-phase) heated at 400 and 500 °C were 3.905 and 3.895eV, respectively. Since, the values of the present study are acceptable when compared with the previous literatures [14,26,27]. So, the presence of β- and h-phase in the present study make a drop in Eg value from 3.9eV to 3.7eV and the conversion of h- to t-phase lead to increase the band gap to 3.8eV. It can be concluded that the optical band gap value of the tetragonal MoO2 phase may be nearly the value of the β-phase. 3.4 Photoluminescence properties The photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the sputtered MoO x thin films are observed in Fig. 6 . It is clearly seen that the PL intensity is decreased as the film thickness increases, i.e. the PL has maximum intensity for low film thickness (39nm). On the other hand, the spectra of the PL of the films have five emission peaks 365, 380, 451, 470, and 725nm, respectively. The same behavior of the broadness over 350–600nm was observed by sharma et al. [28]. Since, the strong peaks at about 365 and 380nm are related to the indigo emission corresponding to the near band edge emission [28,29]. The peak at 451nm may be attributed to the emission in Mo5+ d yz 2 − d xz 2 transition [28]. PL green emission can also be observed at PL peak around 470nm [30] related to the presence of additional MoxOy varieties such as: MoO2, Mo4O11 and Mo5O14and several defects of low level of h-phase [30]. The last band centered at about 725nm is related to the red emission which may be due to the stoichiometric defects obtained during film preparation [31]. Since, the conversion of the h-phase to t-phase leads to decrease the PL intensity and the presence of MoO2 is also confirmed by PL spectra. 4 Conclusion MoO x thin films were deposited by RF-sputtering technique. Tetragonal phase of MoO2 is detected at higher film thickness. The β-MoO3 phaseis also observed through all films. At lower film thickness, the hexagonal phase is formed and changed to the tetragonal phase at higher film thickness. The average crystallite sizes for all the possible phases increases as the film thickness increase. Spherical grains and fine structure were detected through all samples. Direct transition is predominated optical transition of MoO x films and their values changed from 3.74 to 3.8eV with maxima of band gap value of 4.06eV for film thickness 80nm. Photoluminescence spectra show the green and the red emission for all films stoichiometric defects. "," [1] C.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.034,"Investigation of structural, optical and electrical properties of ZnS thin films prepared by ultrasonic spray technique for photovoltaic applications","Abstract ZnS films have important applications in photovoltaic devices. In the current study, the ZnS films were deposited by ultrasonic spray method on heated glass substrate at temperature equal to 450°C. In this article, we report the effect of deposition time on the different structural, optical and electrical properties of ZnS. All the samples obtained were treated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical transmittance spectroscopy (UV-V) and four-point method. The results of X-rays diffraction showed that the deposited material was pure zinc sulfide having a cubic sphalerite structure with preferential orientation along the (111) direction. As well the grain size was around 38–102nm, when the deposition time increases. The transmittance measurements exhibit an average optical transparency between 35 and 75% in the visible range (400–750nm) for different deposition times. The direct band gap energy for all films was calculated and found to be from 3.48 to 3.92eV. The films' thickness is increased with deposition time from 195nm to 1756nm. The electric resistivity of the deposited film varies also with the deposition time between 1.51×105 and 20.84×105 Ω.cm.",Feb-18," Keywords Zinc sulphide Thin films Ultrasonic spray Deposition time XRD Optical and electrical properties 1 Introduction ZnS compound is one of the most important semiconductor material, and it has been largely investigated in the recent years [1]. Due to the wide band gap (3.7eV), non toxicity, safety to environment and high transparency [2] of ZnS, it can be useful for extensively applications in optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diode and laser diode from blue to ultraviolet band [3], fluorescence and electroluminescence thin film devices [4] and n-type window material in solar cell [5]. As well in comparison with CdS, the ZnS thin films are present better lattice matching to CIGS owing to the precedent advantages. According to the literature, Zinc sulphide films can be deposit by several methods including reactive sputtering [6], electro-deposition [7], pulsed-laser deposition [8], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [9], molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [10], spray pyrolysis [11], chemical bath deposition (CBD) [12] and sol-gel process [13]. Among those methods, ultrasonic spray is the best one suited for the preparation of Zinc sulphide (ZnS) thin films because it is simplicity and do not cost an experimental requirement, ease of adding various doping materials, reproducibility, speed growth rate and mass production capability for uniform large area coatings [14]. In this paper, we attended zinc sulphide (ZnS) thin films on the glass substrate by ultrasonic spray technique. The aim of this work is to investigate the structural, electrical and optical properties of ZnS films as a function of deposition time. The obtained results are discussed and compared with other research results reported in the literature. 2 Experimental details The deposition system has been prepared in the laboratory by the simple setup showed in (Fig. 1 ). Zinc sulphide thin films were deposited on glass substrates of the dimension (25×15) mm2 using spray ultrasonic technique. These ZnS thin films exhibited good adherence to the substrate surfaces. The glass substrates were cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and distilled water respectively for 15min, and then blowing dry with a compressed air. The starting solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1M of Zinc Chloride (ZnCl2) and thiourea (SC(NH2)2) in methanol. All the parameters were kept constant such as: the substrate temperature (450°C), the flow rate solution (50ml/h), the distance nozzle-substrate (50mm). While, the deposition time changed from 2, 4, 6, 8, 10min. In the Table 1 , we summarized all the deposition condition. Commonly when the solution droplets reach to the heated substrate surface, the following chemical reaction occurs: Z n C l 2 + C S ( N H 2 ) 2 + C H 3 O H + 3 2 O 2 → Z n S + 2 N H 4 C l ( g a s ) + 2 C O 2 ( g a s ) According to this reaction, a ZnS thin film should be formed on the glass substrate surface and the NH4Cl, CO2 leaves the system in gases form. The structural, optical and electrical characteristics of these films have been studied extensively through several techniques. For the crystalline structure properties of the film was analyzed using X-ray diffracto-meter (D8 ADVANCED BRUKER) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.5418Å) in 2θ range from 10° – 90°. The optical properties have been recorded by using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer LAMBDA25) between the wavelengths of 300 and 1100nm. Moreover the electrical resistivity was determined using the four-point method at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural properties According to the deposition process and experimental factors, Zinc sulphide films can be crystallized in two forms, cubic (Zinc blend) and hexagonal. The Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of ZnS thin films deposited by ultrasonic spray at different deposition times. It was observed at different deposition time that there is a single one peak for all films with the preferred oriented growth along (111) plane at the diffraction angles of 28.7° and this is compatible with exhibited a zinc blende structure (JCPDS card No. 55-0566) in the diffraction angle (2θ) range from 10° to 90°, which means that the planes were parallel to the substrate surface. There is no peak related to the oxidation phase (ZnO) even at the maximum deposition time, which proves that the stoichiometry of our films was improved with increasing deposition times. The same conclusion about good stoichiometry were reported by other author [15,16], for ZnS thin films obtained by spray pyrolysis at different deposition time and (Zn:S) ratio in the precursor solution (A) respectively. Both works of Hwang et al. [17] and Ashrat et al. [18] found the same cubic phase with the preferred orientated along (111) plane of ZnS thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering and close-space sublimation. Fig. 2, also reveals that the intensity of (111) peak increases with the increase deposition times; it becomes narrower, intense when the deposition time equals 10min due to the appearance of this orientation, it depends on: films and the substrate surface energies on one hand, the arriving atoms to substrate on the other hand. The growth is achieved along (111) plane due to its lowest surface energy [19] The grain size (D) of the deposited films can be determined by using equation of Scherer [20]: (1) D = K λ β cos θ Where K is approximately equal to 0.94, λ=1.54184Å, θ is the diffraction angle and β is the width of diffraction line at half maximum intensity. The grain size results are presented in Fig. 3 . It can be observed there is a slight increase with increasing in deposition times between 2 and 6min (38–57nm) and this result is in good agreement with the reported ones by others authors (25–60nm) [21], because grain size enhancement yields to the films optical transmission improvement. The solute atoms coming to the substrate surface can be diffused along the substrate surface and form clusters (nuclei) which can contribute to the formation of crystallites. At low deposition time (2–6min), the diffusion of solute atoms on substrate surface is not eminent which reduced the clusters formation. Hence the density of nucleation center is small, and this lead to smaller grain size. Then significant increases between 6 and 10min in the crystallite size from 38 to 102nm. Similar results have been observed by Abdi et al. [22] and Touatia et al. [23], finding that the grain size was varied between 64 and 104nm and 50–125nm by electron beam deposition and Vacuum Evaporation Method. With increasing the deposition time (6–10min) the number of solute atoms arriving onto the substrate surface is increasing. Consequently the number of nuclei center formed on the substrate surface is large which leads to larger grains formation [24]. The increase of the crystallite size with the increase of deposition time may be also due to decreasing the value of full width half maximum (FWHM) corresponding to (111) peak (as seen in Fig. 3), resulting from the increasing films thickness. A dislocation is known as a crystallographic defect, or irregularity, in a crystal structure, and its presence inside the crystallite structure strongly affects many of the properties of materials. Using the values of grain size, the dislocation density (δ), is defined as the number of dislocation lines per unit volume of the crystal, and it has been calculated depending on the Williamson and Smallman’s relationship [25]: (2) δ = 1 D 2 The micro strains (ε) of films were estimated using the equations [26]: (3) ε = β cos θ 4 The structural parameters were characterized according to the calculated values of average grain size (D), micro strains (ε) and dislocation densities (δ) for ZnS thin films with different deposition time represented in Table 2 The Table 2 shows the calculated micro strain and dislocation density along the orientation (1 1 1) crystallographic plane for different deposition times. It can be seen that the maximum value of dislocation density was obtained for film sprayed at 2min of the deposition time, the reason is due to inverse correlation between dislocation density and the grain size as confirmed in Eq. (2). As seen in the Table 2 the increase in grain size in Zinc sulphide thin films leds to a decrease in grain boundaries and it decreased dislocation defect inside the crystal lattice of the samples and the result of all this was the stress reduced in crystal structure, this later is the results of internal strains. Rahul et al. [27] have reported increases the grain size between 36.12–43.82nm and dislocation density decreases between 7.6×1014 – 5.2×1014 line/m2 for ZnS thin films by thermal evaporation technique. 3.2 Optical properties The thickness of the films was calculated by weighting difference method using a sensitive microbalance according to relation (Eq. (4)): (4) t h i c k n e s s ( t ) = m ρ × a Where m=mass of the deposited film, ρ=density of ZnS, equal 4.1g/cm3 for bulk ZnS cubic structure and a=area of film [28]. The growth rate is estimated by division thickness films on the time of deposition. The variations of the film thickness and growth rate as a function of deposition time are represented in Fig. 4 . It can be observed in Fig. 4 that the film thickness and the growth rate are changing almost linearly with deposition time. The film growth is controlled by kinetics [29] of the reaction between the hot surface substrate and the amount of solution. When the deposition time increases, the mass transfer to the substrate surface increases as well and that means the increasing the mobility of the droplets reaching the substrate surface at high temperature (450°C) and increasing the number of ionized particles. Therefore, this is due to the increases of both; the reaction speeds and the kinetics of the reaction between the substrate surface and the quantity of droplets sprayed onto substrate surface and because of that it increases the growth rate which increases the thickness of ZnS thin films. The same increasing in films thickness have been reported by other authors [15,16] at deposition time between 10 and 25min. While in deposition time equal to 10min, we have noticed a decrease in the growth rate. This indicates that the deposited films becomes approximately in saturation case with increasing the deposition times and this is not allowed to incoming species on surface substrate which have enough appropriate places to forms more materials, which cause the decrease of the growth rate. The high transmittance of the films in the visible range is very important for optical applications. The Fig. 5 , shows the optical transmittance of ZnS films deposited at different deposition times, for incident light at wavelengths from 300 to 1100nm. The whole of the spectra of transmission obtained in our samples are composed of two regions: a region of strong absorption (λ<400nm), corresponding to fundamental absorption in thin films of ZnS. This absorption is due to the electronic transition inter band (the valence band and the band of conduction). The variation of the transmission in this region is exploited for the determination of the optical band gap energy and the disorder. It was also observed that deposition time has affected the position of absorption edge which shifted slightly to longer wavelength. The second region of strong transparency (λ>400nm): the value of the transmission is about 35% to 75%, in the wavelength range of 400–800nm. This changing in transmission values is in good agreement with that obtained values (40–70%) by Daranfed et al. [30] on ZnS thin films prepared by ultrasonic spray method. It is noticed that the transmittance decrease with the increasing deposition time, can be explained by the film thickness increase. We noticed that transmittance spectra have no interference fringe due to the incident light scattering in the material because of interface air/film roughness. The optical band gap of ZnS films can be obtained by the absorption range in the transmittance curve and the Tauc relationship [31] (Eq. (5)): (5) α h ν = K ( h ν − E g ) n Where α is the absorption coefficient, K is a constant, Eg is the optical band gap and n is ½ for a direct-band gap semiconductor. Extrapolation of the line portion of the curve to (αhν)2 =0 gives the optical band gap. The variation of gap optic and extrapolation of the line portion of the curve to (αhν)2 as a function of hν was shown in Fig. 6 Most of band gaps energy values are somewhat lower than that of bulk value of ZnS (3.7eV). According to Fig. 6, the band gap energy of ZnS thin films increases first from 3.48eV to 3.92eV in the range 2–6min. This result is in good agreement with that obtained by Elidrissi et al. [32], the wide band gap energy is the reason of window layer absorption decreases loses and consequently this yields to the solar cell short circuit current improvement. The increase of band gap energy is caused by film thickness increas [33] and Burnstein-Moss effect [34]. However, after that, the gap optic decreased from 3.92eV to 3.56eV with the increasing deposition time, it can be explained this decrease in the gap optic energy to quantum size effect [35] owing to increased crystallite size. Similar results have been observed by Abduljabbar (3.7–3.3eV) [36], Yildrim et al. (3.73–3.57eV)[37] and Nadeem et al. (3.84–3.51eV)[38]. The refractive index (n) of ZnS thin films elaborated at different deposition time is calculated using the model of Herve-Vandamme. The Herve- Vandamme relationship [39] is: (6) n 2 = 1 + ( A E g + B ) 2 Where A and B are constants as A≈13.6eV and B≈3.4eV and Eg is the experimental values of gap optic energy. The refractive index of ZnS thin films elaborated at different values of deposition time is illustrated in Table 3 . As observed in Table 3 the refractive index decreases between 2.11 and 2.21 in the range 2–6min, then increased with the increase the deposition time. Abduljabbar [40] had reported in earlier work, the value of the refractive index of ZnS thin films was around 2.13–2.19 at room temperature and at different temperatures (200°C, 300°C and 400°C). We can attribute this decrease as follows: the increase of the grain size due to decrease of grains boundaries, this may be due to reduced of the stress in the crystalline network of the ZnS thin films. Younghun et al. [41] have also reported the effects of biaxial stress on the refractive index of ZnO:Ga, so they have found that the refractive index decreases with increasing biaxial tensile stress. 3.3 Electrical properties For our study the resistivity is calculated by the following equation [42]: (7) ρ = R d Where ρ is the resistivity, R is the square resistance and d the sample thickness. The variations of ZnS layers resistivity and conductivity versus the deposition time are presented in Fig. 7 . It could be observed that the resistivity of the grown films increases from 1.51×105 Ωcm to 20.84×105 Ωcm with the increasing of the deposition time. These results are lower than Turan et al. ones [43], who studied the electrical properties of ZnO/Au/ZnS/Au films deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Hence, the grain size enlargement leads to a decrease in grain boundary effects, because the boundary hinders the conduction mechanism of carriers charge, and this is the reason for an increase in resistivity. As observed that the increase in the thickness of the samples led also to the increase of the resistivity of ZnS thin films as showing in Eq. (7). Therefore, the resistivity was affected by carrier concentration and deposition time. 4 Conclusion In this work, we have been shown that the deposition time plays a fundamental role on the properties of ZnS thin films deposited by ultrasonic spray on to glass at 450°C substrate temperature. The XRD measurements reveal that the films deposited at 10min have a strongly (111) preferred orientation and are parallel to the substrate surface. The smallest FWHM value of 0.08° has been also been observed for these films, indicating that the crystallinity of the films can be improved by increasing the deposition time. The grain sizes of ZnS calculated by Scherer relationship were found between 38 and 102nm. It has been found that the transmittance decreases with the increase of deposition time. The calculated band gap energy of ZnS has given the values in the range of 3.48–3.92eV. Furthermore, the electrical resistivity (ρ) increased when the deposition time increases. It can be concluded that the perfect condition for the best application photovoltaic cell efficiency of ZnS thin films is to increase the deposition time, owing to band gap energy widening, which can be used as a window layer in heterojunction photovoltaic solar cell or can be used as a reflector and dielectric filter because of its high refractive index (2.2) and its high transmittance in the visible range "," [1] Zhong Chen Sheng Zhou Yang Li Xiao Xia Li Yangsheng Li Wei Sun Guihua Liu Nan Chen Guoping Dua Strong blue luminescence of O2−-doped ZnS nanoparticles synthesized by a low temperature solid state reaction method Mater.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.090,Study on bruising degree classification of apples using hyperspectral imaging and GS-SVM,"Abstract Bruising degree can affect the end use and sales price of apples directly. In order to identify the bruising degrees of apples quickly and accurately, using hyperspectral imaging technology, this study proposed a method combining successive projections algorithm (SPA) with support vector machine based on grid search parameter optimization (GS-SVM) to classify and identify apple samples with different degrees of bruising. In the process of research, firstly, random forest method was used to extract spectral data of bruised areas of apples with a high accuracy, then Kennard-Stone algorithm was performed to partition sample set reasonably to improve performance of the model. After comparing different pretreatment methods, standard normal variate (SNV) transformation method with the best performance was selected to process the spectral data. Finally, in order to reduce the time required to build the model, the GS-SVM models were set up based on the characteristic variables selected by SPA and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), and the classification results were compared with the results of the model constructed with the full spectra. The experimental results showed that the SNV-SPA-GS-SVM model had the best prediction effect, and the prediction accuracy of apples with four kinds of bruising degrees was 95%.",Feb-18," Keywords Apple Hyperspectral imaging GS-SVM Bruising degree classification 1 Introduction Apple is one of the main fruits in our country, which is favored by the majority of the consumers because of its good edible quality and high nutritional value, but the apple will inevitably suffer different extent mechanical damage such as collision, extrusion, and vibration during the process of picking, packing and transporting. Mechanical damage can cause fruit physiological metabolic disorder and microbial infection, prompting the accelerated aging and decay of apples, which causes serious losses of nutrition in apples. Bruising is the main type of mechanical damage. Moreover, objective and quantitative description of bruising degree is not only the important foundations of evaluating apple quality for producers and purchasers, but also has important implications for research on improving postharvest handling and storage operations of apples [1]. Therefore, it is very necessary to identify bruise and quantify bruising degrees of apples before storage in time. So far, some scholars have conducted researches on evaluation index and measuring method of bruising degrees of apples, having discussed effective evaluation indexes such as bruised area, depth, volume and average area value, and a series of measuring methods that include bulk density, respiratory rate, optical property, staining method, X-ray exploration and electrical impedance [2]. Zhulian Wu et al. [3] quantified severity of mechanical damage based on its volume ratio, then analyzed on the relations between damage degree and storability of apple fruits under different mechanical damage treatments. Results proved that effect of the same type of mechanical damage on postharvest storage property of fruits increases with the increasing of intensity of the damage, and the relation between damage degree and storability of fruits varies with the type of mechanical damage under different mechanical damage treatments. Taking bruised length and depth as evaluation indicators of the extent of bruising, Zhongyu Yuan et al. [4] compared the extent of bruising of Qingguan and red Fuji apples after falling from 60cm height and the impact of bruising on physiological reaction and storage quality of these two types of apples, only to find that red Fuji apples are more sensitive to bruising than Qingguan ones, and effects of the same degree of bruising on physiological reaction and storage quality of Qingguan apples are larger than red Fuji ones. All of the above researches evaluate bruising degree based on geometric parameters, manipulate simply and quickly, but bruising degree is not always positively correlated with geometric parameters especially for the apples whose external bruise characteristics are not obvious, so it is necessary to quantify bruising degrees of apples from the perspective of internal composition changes. Shu Zhang et al. [5] measured the optical properties of apples with varying degree bruises in 400–1050nm, then established a discriminant model that combined principal component analysis (PCA) with support vector machine (SVM) to classify and predict the bruising degrees. Results showed the accuracy of the model was as high as 92.5%. However, this solution needs to prepare the flesh of the bruised area cut off with a microtome for observation, which causes damage to the integrity of apples, hence there is an urgent need to develop a new method for non-destructive and more accurate classification of bruising degrees of apples. In recent years, as the hyperspectral imaging technology can obtain spectral information as well as image information of agricultural products, the image information can reflect external features, surface defects and contamination, and the spectral information can be used for the analysis of internal physical structure and chemical composition of objects, hyperspectral imaging technology has been rapidly developed and widely used in quality detection of agricultural products [6–8]. Taking Jonagold apples bruised less than two hours before scanning as study object, Janos C. Keresztes et al. [9] used reflectance calibration and several pre-processing techniques to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of spectra at first, then applied the particle filter algorithm to complete the image post-processing, finally, constructed the pixel based early apple bruise detection model by using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLSDA) method. The research showed that the actual rate for accurately recognizing fresh bruises in thirty apples was 98%. Through artificial simulated experiment, Wenqian Huang et al. [10] damaged apples at the equatorial area by dropping a steel ball weighing 33g from a fixed height about 500mm, then designed a bruise identification system for apples based on hyperspectral imaging technology and segmented principal component analysis. Results of static and online tests showed that the developed system could be used for online detection of bruises on apples. Juan Xing et al. [11] used principal component analysis to process hyperspectral images of ‘Golden Delicious' apples, selecting four characteristic bands for bruise detection, and developed an image processing and classification algorithm based on moments thresholding, which obtained satisfactory classification results of bruise detection with an accuracy of about 86%. Thus, it can be seen that the application of hyperspectral imaging technology to the detection and recognition of bruises on apples has achieved good performance, however few further studies have been done on the classification of bruising degrees of apple. In view of this, this experiment obtained red Fuji apples with different bruising degrees through artificial simulated mechanical damage, then used hyperspectral imaging technology combined with support vector machine based on grid search parameter optimization (GS-SVM) method to realize the automatic classification of apples with different bruising degrees. The specific steps were as follows: 1. utilizing random forest method to extract spectral data of bruised areas on four kinds of samples 2. taking advantage of Kennard-Stone (KS) algorithm to divide spectral data into training set and prediction set 3. comparing the performance of models under different pretreatment methods to select the best pretreatment method 4. using successive projections algorithm (SPA) and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) to select characteristic variables and establishing the corresponding GS-SVM models to classify different bruising degree apples 5. repeating the above steps until completing the identification of five, six and seven categories of bruising degrees 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The experiment selected “red Fuji” apple as the research object, and experimental samples were purchased from ordinary farmer’ market nearby on September 21st, 2016. After careful selection, 40 apple samples without pests and mechanical damage which were similar in their size, diameter and shape were chosen. Each apple had a diameter of approximately 7–8cm. All the chosen apples were carried back to our laboratory with caution, labeled in turn and then placed side by side in a prepared carton. 2.2 Apples' quantitative damage experiment The simulation device of mechanical damage on apple is shown in Fig. 1 . Through a light aluminum rod with 80m length falling from a fixed height with approximate simple pendulum motion, a 22g steel ball fixed on the rod damaged an apple at the equatorial area (in order to prevent damage to the opposite side, a foam pad was placed in the rear of the apple to increase buffer), then the hyperspectral image of this bruised apple was acquired by hyper-spectrometer immediately. After completing the acquisition of the hyperspectral image, the apple was bruised again, and then the apple with second bruise was scanned for the acquisition of the second hyperspectral image, and so on, until eight damage experiments as well as the acquisition of eight corresponding images of each apple were finished. Making sure that the apple was bruised in the same position each time. The above experiment was repeated until the hyperspectral image data acquisition of 40 apples with the first bruise, second bruise, third bruise, fourth bruise, i.e. altogether 8 kinds of bruising degrees was completed finally. For illustrative purposes, the eight types of bruising degrees of apple samples were recorded as Bruise I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII in sequence. 2.3 Hyperspectral image acquisition A schematic diagram of the hyperspectral imaging system and form of three-dimensional hyperspectral data are illustrated in Fig. 2 . As can be seen in the figure, the system is mainly composed of portable hyperspectral imager (SOC710VP, USA), light source, computer (including spectral analysis software) and other devices. The hyperspectral imager, which has an array imaging charge-coupled device (CCD) with a new built-in scan design and 12-bit dynamic range, can obtain high quality data in the wavelength range of 400–1000nm (128 spectral bands); its spectral resolution is about 4.68nm; scanning speed is 32s per cube. The light source system used in the experiment is composed of four 75W halogen lamps (Philips, Holland) which are fixed around the experimental box. In order to reduce the influence of ambient light, the main devices of the system were placed in the sealed experiment box (120×120×160cm) covered by shading cloth, besides, in order to avoid the interference coming from background, black background with low reflectivity was chosen as the shooting background. Before the acquisition of hyperspectral image data, the intensity of the light source and the distance need to be adjusted in order to ensure that the collected image is clear. Obtaining dark current and reflectivity reference data for each scan imaging. In order to eliminate the influence of the uneven illumination intensity, nonlinearity of CCD detector and dark current on the acquisition of spectral images, the original images should be calibrated. The formula for correction [12] is as follows: (1) ρ x y ( λ ) = ρ r e f ( λ ) R x y ( λ ) − R d a r k ( λ ) R ref ( λ ) − R d a r k ( λ ) In the formula (1), ρ xy (λ) is the corrected image, ρ ref (λ) is the reflectivity of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration board, R xy (λ) is the original uncorrected hyperspectral image, R ref(λ) is the scanning image of the calibration board obtained by the hyperspectral image acquisition system in this experiment, R dark (λ) is the completely black image collected after turning off the light source and screwing on the lens cap. Subsequent processing and analysis of image data are all carried out on ρ xy (λ). 2.4 Apple bruised region extraction Random forest, one kind of ensemble learning algorithm, can be carried out for identification and classification of data using multiple classification trees, and has many advantages such as a few adjusted parameters, do not worry about overfitting and fast classification speed. In order to extract the bruised areas of apples accurately, a random forest classification model was established in this study, which was implemented in the PyCharm integrated development environment based on the Python language. Through selecting a region of interest on corrected hyperspectral image, as shown in Fig. 3 , the basic idea was to select the part of spectra in the bruised area (B) and non-bruised area (S) to constitute the data set, then make use of the random forest method to build a bruise identification model, finally, utilize the established model to forecast the spectra of the transition area (X) between the bruised area and non-bruised area which is not easy to get good segmentation. The sum of the spectra of the bruised area predicted by the above method and area B were both that's required. 2.5 Classification and identification of bruising degrees After the extraction of bruised areas, the average spectrum in the bruised region of each sample was achieved by calculation, then the research was conducted with the value of corrected reflectance as the independent variable x and the variety of bruising degree as the dependent variable y. 2.5.1 Regional spectral data preprocessing Under normal circumstances, due to the influence of the heterogeneity of the sample, high-frequency random noise, baseline drift, light scattering and other factors during the process of sampling, the collected spectral signals will inevitably exist a variety of distortion and noise information which will affect the prediction effect of the model, therefore, it is important to preprocess the original hyperspectral data with different pretreatments before modeling. In commonly used spectral pretreatment methods, first derivative (1D) can be used to correct the baseline drift and spectral rotation in the background of this system, Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing can filter out the high-frequency noise in the spectral data and well preserve the authenticity of the original signal, and standard normal variate (SNV) is mainly used for the scattering correction of spectra. This study adopted the SNV, 1D, SG smoothing and their combination methods to preprocess the original hyperspectral data, and then investigated the difference of GS-SVM models established by different pretreatment methods to choose the optimal one for the classification of bruising degrees. 2.5.2 Spectral variable selection Since the original hyperspectral data with a total of 128 bands contain a large amount of information, if spectral data of the whole wave-band are taken as independent variables into the model, the execution efficiency of the program will be greatly reduced. Accordingly, it is necessary to discover valuable information from full spectra (FS) and select the wavelength variables contributing the most to the performance of the model, which not only reduces the complexity of the model but also improves the performance of the model [13]. In this study, successive projections algorithm and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling were applied to select effective spectral variables from the FS to predict apples with varying degree bruises. Successive Projections Algorithm Successive projection algorithm is a method of obtaining the minimum linear variable set by using vector projection operation in vector space, is a kind of multivariate calibration method based on positive variable selection [14]. The principle of variable selection by SPA is that candidate variables which have the maximum projection value on the orthogonal subspace of the previously selected variables are firstly chosen, then the optimal number of variables is determined on the basis of the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) obtained from validation set of multiple linear regression (MLR) calibration, and then the uninformative variables are deleted through a variable elimination procedure without significant loss of prediction capability. Many successful applications have proven SPA to be an outstanding variable selection approach [15–17]. Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling CARS is a novel and useful method for selecting effective variables which mimics the principle of “survival of the fittest” from Darwinian evolution theory. Through adaptive reweighted sampling (ARS) technique, CARS preserves the wavelength variables with large absolute values of regression coefficients of PLS model, and removes the ones with small absolute values of regression coefficients, so as to obtain a series of wavelength variable subsets. Subsequently, each of those variable subsets is verified by using cross validation models, and the optimal variable subset is chosen according to the lowest root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) criterion of the model. More details on the steps involved in CARS application can be found in previous studies [18–20]. 2.5.3 Bruising degree classification based on GS-SVM The support vector machine method is a method to improve the generalization ability of the learning machine according to the principle of structural risk minimization, which is characterized in that the decision rules obtained by limited training samples can guarantee a high accuracy for an independent test set. Fig. 4 shows the schematic of support vector machine network structure, its basic idea was to use the kernel function to map the infrared spectra of apples as input data into a high dimensional feature space, and then structure an optimal linear classification hyperplane in the space, which can separate different kinds of samples accurately, so as to achieve the purpose of classification of bruising degrees. However, SVM can only deal with a binary classification problem and many practical bruising degree classification problems are multi-classification ones usually, so it is necessary to structure a multi-class SVM classifier. The study employed LIBSVM library developed by Lin Chih-Jen, a professor of Taiwan University, to deal with classification problems of bruising degrees of apples, according to “one versus one” classification strategy, designed a SVM between any two classes of apple samples, and then classified the unknown samples by voting, thus constructing a multi-class classifier to identify the bruising degrees of apples. In the experiment, the kernel function of support vector machine is based on radial basis function (RBF), yet the determination of the kernel parameter g and the penalty factor C in the kernel function has a great influence on the performance of support vector machine system, thus grid search algorithm (GSA) is applied in this research to find the optimal parameters of C and g. The underlying principle of GSA is to make C and g value all the points in the grid partitioned in a certain space, then use k-fold cross validation method to determine the classification accuracy of the training set for each given group of C and g, and make the final selection of a group of parameters which make the classification accuracy rate of the training set the highest for SVM classification [21]. Compared to other SVM parameter optimization methods (such as k-fold cross validation method, genetic algorithm), GSA is more intuitive, can obtain the optimal parameters through exhaustive search and apply parallel computing, thus saving the time required for parameter optimization [22]. The flow chart of the whole algorithm based on the GS-SVM model for bruising degree classification of apples is shown in Fig. 5 . 3 Results and discussion In the course of the damage simulation experiment, apple peel began to break out after being damaged five times, at that point the naked eye could well distinguish its bruising degree, therefore this article first carried out classification experiment on the first four relatively light bruising degrees, and then repeated the above experiment to complete the classification of more than four types of bruising degrees. 3.1 Classification of four types of bruising degrees 3.1.1 Bruised area spectra extraction Whether employing manually selected region of interest or threshold segmentation method, it is difficult to obtain a complete bruised area of an apple, the edge of the bruised area is particularly prone to be misjudged. To avoid this, this experiment obtained a high-precision classification model based on random forest by training part of spectra in the bruised area and non- bruised area in a supervised way, then used the established model to predict the spectra of the transition area between the bruised area and non- bruised area, so as to achieve the purpose of extracting the spectral data of bruised area accurately. The results of bruise identification of the hyperspectral images obtained by scanning the twenty-sixth apple with Bruise I–IV are shown in Fig. 6 (a)–(d), respectively. 3.1.2 Spectral analysis of bruised area As shown in Fig. 7 , the average spectra of bruised areas of apples with four levels of bruising were drawn with MATLAB 9.0 (MathWorks, USA) software in different colors and lines. As this figure shows, hyperspectral curves of apples with different bruising degrees had a similar tendency in the range of 400nm–1000nm, and all had strong absorption peaks located around 500nm, 680nm, and 960nm. The strong absorption peaks around 500 and 680 represent carotenoids and chlorophyll pigments which reflect the surface color information of the apple, the strong absorption peak in the near infrared reflection (NIR) at 960nm represents water absorption bands, which is affected by moisture absorption on the surface of the apple tissue. It is difficult to distinguish the bruising degrees of apples only from the spectral characteristics of hyperspectral data, so modeling method of chemometrics can be applied to analyze and process the spectral data. 3.1.3 Sample set partitioning In KS algorithm, all samples are considered as candidate samples of calibration set, first of all, two vectors whose Euclidean distance is the farthest are chosen into the calibration set, then, the distance from each sample in the remaining candidate samples to each selected calibration sample is calculated, at last, the minimum distance sample and the maximum distance sample are found to be added to the calibration set, this procedure is repeated until the required amount of samples is reached. In order to make the distribution of the calibration set in each category sample space more uniform, this experiment classified sample data in each category into calibration and prediction set according to 3:1 by KS method, finally merged all the obtained calibration sets and prediction sets separately. As a consequence, altogether 120 representative spectra (including 30 spectra with Bruise I–IV) singled out from 160 spectra of apples with varying degree bruises were used as the calibration set to build model and the remaining 40 spectra (including 10 spectra with Bruise I–IV) were used as prediction set to test the reliability of the model. The category numbers of the samples in the calibration set and the prediction set were uniformly distributed in the sample space, which had relatively good representation. 3.1.4 Spectral data preprocessing This experiment used different pretreatment methods including SNV, SG smoothing, 1D and their combinations to eliminate the noise of original hyperspectral data, thus obtaining higher signal-to-noise ratio spectra, which could contribute to the robustness of subsequent prediction model and the extension of the forecast results. Therefore, it is necessary to select the most effective preprocessing method from various pretreatment methods for following modeling research. A preliminary prediction model of bruising degrees based on spectral data processed by each pretreatment method was established by using GS-SVM, and then the influence of different pretreatment methods on the prediction accuracy of models was discussed. The identification results of the models under different pretreatment methods are shown in Table 1 . As Table 1 shows, standard normal variate transformation as the pretreatment method achieved the best result which was that the accuracy of the GS-SVM classification model was the highest and the number of error samples was the least. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the combination method of standard normal variable transformation and other methods was also significantly higher than that of other methods alone. This may because there are great differences between apples and apple's surface is not flat, resulting in the variations of the measured sample spectra. Meanwhile, for some samples, spectral changes due to scattering may be greater than that caused by variation of internal composition. However, the standard normal variable transformation can eliminate the influence of scattering disturbance through correcting spectra with the mean and standard deviation of each spectrum [23], so as to yield fairly ideal spectra. Accordingly, in this study, the standard normal variate transformation method was used to process the spectral data of the apple samples, and the raw and processed spectra of all samples are shown in Fig. 8 a, b respectively. 3.1.5 Spectral variable selection Spectral Variables Selected by SPA As mentioned above, this paper tried the SPA method to select the effective spectral variables from the FS pretreated by SNV to predict apples with varying degree bruises. During performing the SPA, a MLR analysis procedure was applied for the calculation of a sequence of RMSE values using the selected variable subsets [24]. Fig. 9 obtained by applying SPA illustrates a graph of RMSE changing with increasing number of selected variables. It can be observed that when 33 wavelength variables were selected, the RMSE reached its optimal value (0.25968) for prediction of bruising degrees of apples, and the number of selected variables was relatively less. Fig. 10 shows the distribution of these selected spectral variables (marked by rectangles) on the raw spectral curve. Later, in next part, the prediction results of the model will be used to illustrate the effectiveness of the 33 variables selected by SPA. The aim of the CARS method is to eliminate the useless variables and improve the model’s performance. Fig. 11 shows the variable selection results of the CARS algorithm (the number of Monte Carlo sampling runs is set to 50). Fig. 11a–c gives the changing trend of the number of sampled variables, 10-fold cross validation RMSECV values and regression coefficient of each variable with the increasing of Monte Carlo (MC) sampling runs in a CARS run, respectively. In Fig. 11a, the number of sampled variables decreases fast at first and then slowly, which displayed that in this algorithm the whole variable selection process was divided into two phases: coarse selection and refined selection. Fig. 11 b reflects when the number of Monte Carlo sampling runs reached 23 (signed by asterisk vertical in Fig. 11c), the PLS model obtained the minimum RMSECV, which demonstrated the best performance of the model at this point. Therefore, the optimal variable subset, which consists of 396, 500, 626, 631, 647, 719, 724, 734, 808, 882, 887, 898, 903, 908, 914, 967, 973, 978, 983, and 989nm, was determined for predicting the bruising degrees of apples, while the corresponding number of sampled variables was 20. 3.1.6 Classification of bruising degrees The spectrum data corresponding to characteristic variables selected by SPA and CARS were set as input to establish SVM models for predicting the bruising degrees of apple samples respectively. In addition, the optimal combinations of parameters C and g of the models were obtained by grid search algorithm, where the value range of C and g were both set between 2-5 and 25, the value of K was set to 3, and the step size of parameters C and g were both set to 1. The prediction results of these two models established ultimately, compared with that of another model based on full spectra, are shown in Table 2 . As can be seen from Table 2, the GS-SVM model based on the spectral data corresponding to the characteristic variables selected by SPA offered the best performance, which was that the prediction accuracy of the model for bruising degrees of apples reached 95%. Though the number of selected spectral variables by SPA was bigger than that by CARS, much smaller than 128 by FS, SPA-GS-SVM was without doubt the best prediction model. Fig. 12 displays the classification results of the GS-SVM model based on SPA variable selection algorithm. It showed that only two samples were incorrectly classified in 40 prediction samples, one of which was an apple with Bruise III, another was an apple with Bruise IV. The reason why these two samples were misclassified may be: in gathering image, light spot on the surface of apple formed by light scattering and the variation in curvature of apple surface exactly coincided with bruised area at a particular point of view, so that spectral information of bruised area was covered. 3.2 Classification of more than four categories of bruising degrees Based on the above experiment, the spectral data of apples with Bruise V were extracted in the same way and then 40 average spectra were obtained by calculation. The 40 average spectra were still divided into calibration set and prediction set according to 3:1 by the KS method, then the resulting sample sets were merged with previously obtained sample sets. Finally, we compared the accuracy of the GS-SVM model to identify five kinds of bruising degrees under different pretreatment methods. By comparison, the prediction accuracy of the model was the highest under SNV pretreatment, which reached 80% (10 samples were incorrectly sorted). And so on, until the experiments on the classification of six categories, seven categories and eight categories of bruising degrees were completed, and the highest recognition accuracy obtained in each group of experiment is shown in Fig. 13 . 1–4: Classification of four kinds of bruising degrees (from Bruise Ⅰ to Bruise Ⅳ); 1–5: Classification of five kinds of bruising degrees (from Bruise Ⅰ to Bruise Ⅴ); and so on. It can be illustrated that the accuracy of classification was getting lower and lower with the gradual increase in the number of categories, which meant that severely bruised samples which were later added to the model were hard to be identified correctly. This may because apple peel began to break out after being bruised five times, at this point epidermal cell wall was broken, which had certain effects on the mechanical properties of apples [5]. And then cytoplasmic, sugar and pectin overflowed, phenolic compounds released were oxidized to quinone compounds, which would make an enormous impact on spectral data. 4 Conclusions Adopting hyperspectral imaging technology, this study proposed a method for classification and identification of the bruising degrees of apple samples by combining successive projections algorithm used for dimension reduction with support vector machine based on grid parameter optimization. In the course of the study, firstly, random forest method was used to extract the spectral data of the bruised region accurately, then, the KS method was used to partition 40 spectra of each type of samples reasonably, and the representative samples were selected to build the model to improve the performance of the model. The best pretreatment method was selected to process the spectral data by comparison. Finally, in order to reduce the time required for the model, the spectrum data corresponding to characteristic variables selected by SPA and CARS were set as independent variables to establish the GS-SVM models, classification results of which were compared with that of another model based on the FS. The results showed that the SNV-SPA-GS-SVM model had the best prediction effect, the prediction accuracy of four kinds of bruising degrees amounted to 95%, that is, the result of the prediction set containing 40 samples was only wrong in 2 samples. Afterwards, the said experimentation process was repeated, and classification experiments on five classes, six classes, seven classes and eight classes of bruising degrees were completed, obtaining that the classification accuracy was 80%, 78.3%, 67.1%, 62.5%, respectively. It can be found that the identification accuracy of severely bruised samples was far lower than that of the first four categories of bruised samples. On the whole, the model can realize the classification of apples with four kinds of bruising degrees quickly and accurately, which can be put into practical applications.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.037,Accurate regulation of circular dichroism signal in double-layer nanostructure,"Abstract Chiral plasmonic systems have been shown to exhibit stronger circular dichroism (CD) because of strong interaction between light and noble metals. In this study, we utilize double-layer chiral plasmonic nanostructures composed of achiral nanoplate and two achiral nanodisks to produce a chiroptical response. The chiroptical response is due to the twisted electric dipoles and the phase between them. In addition, the CD signal of the plasmonic nanostructure can be accurately regulated when plasmonic nanostructure parameters are tuned. Overall, results will allow further tuning of the optical responses in plasmonic systems to tailor chiral light–matter interaction.",Feb-18," Keywords Chirality Plasmonic Circular dichroism Localized surface plasmon 1 Introduction Chiral structures are those that cannot be superposed with their mirror images [1–4]. Chiral metamaterials have revealed several novel electromagnetic phenomena, such as negative refraction [5,6], asymmetric transmission effect [7–10], linear or/to circular polarization conversion [11,12], circular dichroism (CD) effect [13–16] and others. In particular, the CD of circularly polarized light through chiral metamaterials has attracted significant attention in recent years. This effect is due to different transmission intensities between the left circularly polarized light (LCP) and right circularly polarized light (RCP). Chiral structures with CD are always related to circular polarizers for optoelectronic conversion [17,18], polarization conversion [19,20], and molecular analysis [21–24]. In recent years, the CD effect of nanoscale plasmonic systems was widely studied. The nanoscale plasmonic systems have shown significantly enhanced CD because of the strong interaction between light and noble metals [25,26]. These significant interactions between electric and magnetic resonance cause large CD signals in 3D helix or helix-like chiral plasmonic nanostructures [27–32]. Thus, a layer-by-layer chiral nanostructure is designed considering that the helix-like chiral structure is complex and not easy to tune. In addition, the layer-by-layer chiral plasmonic nanostructure can generate larger CD signals because of the coupling between two layers [33–41]. Various approaches have been used to create plasmonic nanostructures and tune chiroptical responses. Changing parameters are often applied to tune the magnitude of a CD signal or shift the wavelength of the aforementioned chiral structures; however, the CD signals cannot be regulated individually. This phenomenon provides a hint to design nanoscale plasmonic systems to accurately regulate optical response without affecting another response. In this study, a double-layer chiral mental nanostructure that consists of an achiral nanoplate and two achiral nanodisks were designed to generate a CD effect. The results show that the double-layer chiral mental nanostructure generates two CD signals, and one CD signal can be tuned by varying the parameter without affecting the other CD signal. This process enables investigating plasmonic analog and studying optical response when the resonances of the constituents are intentionally tuned. In addition, the Born–Kuhn model has been used to analytically interpret the observed CD spectrum, providing insight into the underlying coupling mechanisms. This study can guide the design to accurately tune chiroptical response for practical application in biosensing. 2 Structure and computational method Fig. 1 (a) shows the proposed nanostructure arrays, and each unit is composed of two layers. The bottom layer is two nanodisks and the top layer is a nanoplate. The rotational symmetry centers of the two nanodisks coincide with the center of the nanoplate in the z-direction. The period is Px =300nm and Py =300nm in the x and y direction, respectively. Fig. 1(b) depicts the cell of nanostructure in x-z plane. The radius of nanodisk is labeled as R. The nanoplate has a length of L. The width and height of nanoplates are indicated as W =60nm and H =20nm, respectively. The gap between two layers is G. Fig. 1(c) shows the cell of nanostructure in x-y plane. And the twist angle between the line of center of two nanodisks is α in the x-y plane. The distance between the centers of the two nanodisks is D =120nm. The 3D finite-element method software COMSOL Multiphysics is used to calculate the transmittance of nanostructure arrays. The refractive index of gold is taken from Ref. [42]. The excitation sources are RCP light and LCP light along the −z direction and the magnitude of the incident electric field is set at 1V/m. Transmittance was defined as T = P out/P in, which is the ratio of output power to incident power. The transmittance spectrum of RCP light and LCP light are represented by T ++ and T –, respectively. Therefore, the chirality of structures is represented by CD= T ++ − T –. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 2 (a) shows the transmission spectra of plasmonic arrays under RCP and LCP light illuminations. The structure parameters of the arrays are L =180nm, R =30nm, α=45°, and G =20nm. Two evident resonant modes, namely, modes I and II of approximately 860 and 550nm, respectively, are observed in the transmission spectra. Fig. 2(b) is the CD spectra of the nanostructure arrays. One CD peak and valley appear at the resonance wavelengths. In mode I, the transmittance under LCP illumination is larger than those under RCP illumination. In mode II, the transmittance under RCP illumination is larger than those under LCP illumination. Around the resonance wavelengths, the spectra of T ++ and T −− correspondingly present different responses, thereby leading to a large CD effect. The charge distributions were examined to investigate the transmission mechanism of the nanostructure arrays under circular illumination. Fig. 3 shows the top view of the normalized charge distributions of the nanodisk and nanoplate, where red and blue indicate positive and negative charges, respectively. Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the normalized charge distributions of the nanoplate at modes I and II, respectively. The green arrows represent the equivalent electric dipole moments of nanoplate (upper layer). Fig. 3(c) and (d) shows the normalized charge distributions of the nanodisks at modes I and II, respectively. The light-blue arrows represent the equivalent electric dipole moments of the nanodisk (lower layer). At λ I =860nm, the equivalent electric dipole moment of the nanoplate along the long axis direction is presented. The effective dipoles P I-D1 and P I-D2 constitute P I-D. In Fig. 3(e), P I-D and P I-U form a bonding mode in the Born–Kuhn oscillator model [43,44]. At λ I =550nm, the effective dipole P I-U represents the equivalent electric dipole moment of the nanoplate along the short axis direction. P II-D1 and P II-D2 represent the equivalent electric dipole moments of nanodisks and can also constitute P II-D. In Fig. 3(f), P II-D and P II-U form a bonding mode in the Born–Kuhn oscillator model. Most importantly, the resonance mode of the nanodisks occurs at approximately 550nm and that of the nanoplate is at 860nm. In addition, we sequentially investigate the influence of varied α, L, R, and G of nanostructure arrays on CD where other parameters are fixed as in the control group. The angle between the two layers was tuned to explore the influence of asymmetry of nanostructure on CD. Fig. 4 (a) depicts the simulated CD spectra in different angle α with fixed L =180nm, G =20nm, and R =30nm to investigate the effects of angle α on CD. At α=0° and 90°, the structure is achiral, and the two peaks disappear. When α is increased from 0° to 150°, modes I and II do not shift. With an increase in α, every equivalent electric dipole moment of components is not changed; thus, modes I and II do not shift. Fig. 4(b) shows the simulated CD spectra for different length of nanoplate with fixed G =20nm, R =30nm, and α=45° to investigate the effects of length L on chiroptical response. As we can see in Fig. 4(b), mode I red shifted whereas mode II unchanged with the length of nanoplate increased. With an increase in L, the equivalent electric dipole moments P I-U on the nanoplate increased, resulting in red shift of the resonance wavelength. But the equivalent electric dipole moments P II-D and P II-U both unchanged, resulting in mode II does not shift. Thus, mode II can be individually tuned by length of the nanoplate. In Fig. 4(c), the CD spectra is shown for G =20nm, α=45°, and L =180nm with different radius of nanodisk. With an increase of R, mode II blue shift, but mode I does not shift. In the near field, the component of P I-D and P II-D increased with an increase of R, thereby resulting in the red shift of mode II. However, the equivalent electric dipole moments P I-U and P II-U both unchanged, resulting in mode I does not shift. Thus, mode II can be individually tuned by radius of the nanodisk. Finally, the distance of two layers was tuned to investigate the influences of the coupling of the chiroptical response. Fig. 4(d) shows the CD spectra of different gap G between two layers with fixed L =180nm, R =30nm, and α=45°. At mode I and II, CD spectra undergo a continuous blue-shift for the increasing gap G. Given that modes I and II are ascribed to the bonding mode between the electron oscillations on the nanodisk and nanoplate, this finding indicates that attraction exists between nanodisk and nanoplate. An increased G will decrease the attraction between them, leading to a decrease in the equivalent electric dipole moments and resulting in the blue shift of the resonant wavelength. Experimentally, the middle dielectric layer was considered in the design of chiral plasmonic nanostructure. When the middle SiO2 dielectric layer was added, the resonance modes red shifted. 4 Conclusions A double-layer chiral plasmonic nanosystem with two nanodisks and a nanoplate is proposed to generate a chiral response. The two CD signals can be regulated individually in the nanostructure. Mode I is mainly due to the resonance of the nanoplate along the long axis. Mode II is mainly due to the resonance of the nanodisks. The CD mechanism of the double-layer nanostructure satisfies the Born–Kuhn model for CD effects. Overall, these results are useful for designing a chiral plasmonic nanosystem for a tailored light–matter interaction. This system is expected to be widely applied in biological monitoring, analytical chemistry, and negative refractive-index media.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.067,Two and three-input all-optical logic gates on a planar three-core photonic crystal fiber,"Abstract In this paper, we numerically demonstrate the acquisition of two all-optical devices that perform the OR and AND logic operations using a solid core Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) with three symmetrical cores in planar array using solitonic pulses modulated in PAM-ASK. We numerically simulated the propagation of 100 femto-second (fs) solitonic pulses through the PCF and solved the coupled-mode equations using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. For the first device, we obtained the passive three-input OR and AND all-optical logic gates, which operated with high performance, so they could be used to replace more complex optical circuits (in which the occurrence of Boolean expressions like the three-input OR and three-input AND are very common) without the need for concatenation therefore saving space and eliminating problems regarding the cascading of logic gates. For the second device, we obtained the active two-input OR and AND all-optical logic gates, which operated with exceptionally high contrast ratios and could therefore be used in optical signals processing.",Feb-18," Keywords All-Optical logic gate Nonlinear directional coupler (NLDC) Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) 1 Introduction The photonic crystal fiber (PCF), also known as micro-structured fiber, is made of non-doped silica and it is, externally, very similar to the conventional optical fiber. Its main structural difference consists of air holes that cross it from end to end and form a matrix. The holey matrix has as its main physical parameters d, the diameter of the holes (usually filled with air) and Λ, which represents the distance between the holes. The enhanced nonlinear response in the PCF appears as a combination of its strong mode confinement and altered dispersion properties. The dispersion in these fibers is adapted (customized) by altering its geometric parameters: fiber length, air hole diameter, hole-to-hole distance, hole pattern, number of cores, core arrangement (planar, triangular, etc.), distance between cores, etc. [1–3]. A strong light confinement field can be obtained with a high contrast between the refractive indexes of the core and the holey cladding [4], which allows for improved nonlinear optical interactions with lower light energies if compared to conventional fibers. Several theoretical studies have shown that, in comparison to two-core nonlinear directional couplers (NLDCs), three-core couplers have more output states, sharper switching characteristics and greater sensitivity to the input states, being these characteristics of great importance in all-optical switching schemes [5–8]. As shown in Refs. [9,10] and [11], a PCF can act as a nonlinear directional coupler (NLDC) made entirely of fiber. The coupler model investigated here consists of a PCF with three symmetrical solid cores in a parallel equidistant arrangement (planar symmetrical arrangement), as shown in Fig. 1 . In the PCF, the holey matrix has three parallel solid cores separated by a distance C, distance between holes Λ and hole diameter d. The coupler is a six-ports device, three inputs (S 1, S 2, and S 3) and three outputs (S 4, S 5, and S 6), whose function is to coherently divide the optical beam inserted into one of the input ports and direct it to the output ports. The cores are quite close so that the fundamental modes of propagation of each core partially overlap in the cladding region between the two cores over the entire coupling length LC. For the modulation of the input pulses in the coupler we use 3 amplitude modulators, ɛ, and 2 phase controllers, Δϕ, arranged as shown in Fig. 2 . Although the OR, AND and NOT gates are sufficient for the creation of any logic circuit, it is worth noting that obtaining some of the more commonly used logical expressions, such as the three-input AND and OR gates, is also of great interest since we can save on resources, space, power losses and processing time by using ready-made expressions instead of a set of other concatenated logic gates. There are, up to date, several studies on the acquisition of all-optical logic gates, either by using couplers, interferometers or waveguides [12–15]. Most optical devices proposed for logic operations using conventional fiber couplers have coupling lengths that can range from a few units up to tens of meters [6,16,17], and can therefore occupy large spaces in the construction of complex circuits. Thus, the utilization of PCFs offers a considerable reduction in coupling lengths, achieving the same results with only a few centimeters of fiber [13]. These coupling lengths may be even smaller depending on the physical parameters and the pattern of the holey matrix in the PCF [11,18]. In this paper, we numerically demonstrate the acquisition of all-optical logic gates based on a planar three-core PCF coupler operating with 100fs solitonic pulses modulated on PAM-ASK (Pulse Amplitude Modulation with Amplitude Shift Keying). We obtained two devices with lengths of L=1.08cm and L=1.2cm, being both less than half of the coupling length for pulses inserted into cores 1 or 3 on this specific coupler. For the first device, L=1.08cm, we found two of the most common Boolean expressions in logic circuits, the passive three-input OR and AND logic gates. For the second device, L=1.2cm, we found the active two-input OR and AND logic gates. For both devices the desired logic operation (AND or OR) is selected by adjusting the phases of the input pulses. All logic gates have high contrast ratios in the worst case, so these are of high performance. In particular, the three-input OR and AND logic gates (which are now being demonstrated for the first time when using PCF with PAM-ASK modulation) are an interesting result for allowing us to save on space and avoid problems regarding the cascading of logic gates in the creation of more complex optical circuits. This work is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the theoretical model of the planar three-core PCF coupler based on the three coupled-mode equations; in Section 3, we present the PAM-ASK modulation, the PCF parameters and the details of the numerical method used in the solution of the coupled-mode equations; in Section 4, we present an analysis of the obtained results; finally, in Section 5, we present the conclusion of this work. 2 Theoretical model For typical applications of nonlinear characteristics in optical communications, small solid core PCFs with high nonlinearity are preferred. Due to the large difference between the refractive indexes of the silica core and the air-holes cladding, these PCFs allow for a much stronger mode confinement and, therefore, much higher nonlinearities [4]. The effective nonlinearity γ of a fiber is given by: (1) γ = 2 π n 2 λ A eff where Aeff is the effective area, λ is the wavelength and n2 is the nonlinear index coefficient [19]. So, one way of increasing the nonlinearity is to reduce the effective area [4]. By properly choosing the size and pattern of the air holes in the holey matrix, the effective area can be reduced thereby increasing the nonlinear phase variation during the pulse propagation in the fiber. The effective nonlinear modal area of a PCF is given by: (2) A eff = n 2 [ ∫ ∫ E ( x , y ) · E * ( x , y ) dxdy ] 2 ∫ ∫ n ¯ 2 ( x , y ) [ E ( x , y ) · E * ( x , y ) ] 2 dxdy where E ( x , y ) is the transverse electric field and n ¯ 2 ( x , y ) is the nonlinear index of the material at position (x, y) [4]. In PCFs, the group velocity dispersion (GVD) is determined both by the dispersion of the silica itself and by the parameters of hole diameter, d, hole-to-hole distance, Λ, and the pattern of the holey matrix, which allows for greater flexibility in the dispersion design to suit the application required. The dispersion coefficient of a fiber is given by: (3) D = − 2 π c λ 2 β 2 = − λ c d 2 n eff ( λ ) d λ 2 where β 2 is the group velocity dispersion, neff is the effective refractive index of the mode, given by n eff ( x , y ) = β [ λ , n m ( λ ) ] / k 0 , β is the propagation constant, k0 =2π/λ is the free space wave number and n m ( λ ) is the chromatic dispersion of the material [19]. So, the fiber dispersion is determined by two types of dependence of β with regard to λ: The geometric dispersion, Dg , given by D g = − ( λ c ) d 2 n g ( λ ) / d λ 2 , that originates from the explicit dependence of β on λ, which is produced by the refractive index distribution geometry n g ( λ ) in the PCF; And the material dispersion, Dm , given by D m = − ( λ c ) d 2 n m ( λ ) / d λ 2 , that originates from the implicit dependence of β on λ through the chromatic dispersion of the material. The total dispersion D is then calculated as the sum of the geometric dispersion Dg and the material dispersion Dm in the first order approximation [20]: (4) D ≈ D g + D m So, we can clearly see that the problem in designing the dispersion of a PCF is to design Dg . The effective refractive index n g ( λ ) depends on the cladding parameters (d and Λ) and the wavelength λ. Thus, the group velocity dispersion (GVD) can be projected from (3). This property has been extensively numerically investigated [2,20–23]. For the analyzed coupler model, the optical power transfer between the three cores can be described by three coupled-mode equations. Due to the planar arrangement of the cores, the modes of the pulses in cores 1 and 3 do not interact with each other. The nonlinear coupled-mode equations, obtained from the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE) for the planar three-core nonlinear directional coupler are given by: i ∂ a 1 ∂ z − β 2 2 ∂ 2 a 1 ∂ t 2 − i β 3 6 ∂ 3 a 1 ∂ t 3 + γ ( | a 1 | 2 + η | a 2 | 2 ) a 1 + i γ ω ∂ ( | a 1 2 | a 1 ) ∂ t (5) − γ a 1 T R ∂ | a 1 | 2 ∂ t + κ 0 ( a 2 ) + i κ 1 ∂ ( a 2 ) ∂ t = 0 i ∂ a 2 ∂ z − β 2 2 ∂ 2 a 2 ∂ t 2 − i β 3 6 ∂ 3 a 2 ∂ t 3 + γ ( | a 2 | 2 + η | a 1 + a 3 | 2 ) a 2 + i γ ω ∂ ( | a 2 2 | a 2 ) ∂ t (6) − γ a 2 T R ∂ | a 2 | 2 ∂ t + κ 0 ( a 1 + a 3 ) + i κ 1 ∂ ( a 1 + a 3 ) ∂ t = 0 i ∂ a 3 ∂ z − β 2 2 ∂ 2 a 3 ∂ t 2 − i β 3 6 ∂ 3 a 3 ∂ t 3 + γ ( | a 3 | 2 + η | a 2 | 2 ) a 3 + i γ ω ∂ ( | a 3 2 | a 3 ) ∂ t (7) − γ a 3 T R ∂ | a 3 | 2 ∂ t + κ 0 ( a 2 ) + i κ 1 ∂ ( a 2 ) ∂ t = 0 where a 1, a 2 and a 3 are the amplitudes envelopes of the pulses inserted into cores 1, 2 and 3 respectively; z is the distance along the fiber; t is the time coordinate with regard to the transit time of the pulses; β 2 is the group velocity dispersion (GVD) and β 3 is the third order dispersion (TOD); γ is the nonlinearity parameter referring to self-phase modulation (SPM); TR is the Raman scattering coefficient; η is the ratio of cross-phase modulation (XPM) with regard to SPM; κ 0 is the coupling coefficient and κ1 is the coupling coefficient dispersion, given by κ 1 = dκ0/dω [9]. 3 Methodology The pulses inserted into inputs ports S 1, S 2, and S 3 were modulated in PAM-ASK as bits 1 or 0 and passed through the coupler then resulting in output ports S 4, S 5, and S 6. By inserting a low intensity pulse and neglecting the dispersion in small propagation lengths we have then that the transmission is periodic with the fiber length. In linear regime, for pulses inserted into cores 1 or 3 on planar three-core couplers, the transmission T is given by T 2 = 1 4 ( cos ( 2 κ z ) + 1 ) 2 . The coupling length LC is where the light reaches the lowest intensity in the input core. Thus, for pulses inserted into cores 1 or 3, L C = π / 2 κ ≅ 2.54 cm [8]. In order to find logic gates in the shortest possible length we tested coupler lengths limited by LC and found logic gates at L=1.08cm and L=1.2cm. 3.1 PAM-ASK modulation Most lightwave digital systems employ ASK because the pulses transmitted in optical fibers must have a wavelength of λ=1.55μm (and hence a fixed frequency) to minimize losses. Using a hyperbolic secant A ( z , t ) with amplitude AREF and offset parameter ɛ as the reference pulse, the pulse is modulated into the form A b ( 0 , t ) = [ A REF + ( − 1 ) 1 − b ε ] sech ( t ) , where b is the desired bit (0 or 1). Like this, the zero pulse (representing bit b =0) is given by A 0 ( 0 , t ) = ( A REF − ε ) secht and the one pulse (representing bit b =1) is given by A 1 ( 0 , t ) = ( A REF + ε ) secht . The reference pulse is given by A REF ( 0 , t ) = A REF secht . For the output pulses analysis we observe the output amplitude AOUT of each signal. We consider as bit 1 signals whose amplitude is greater than the reference amplitude AREF and as bit 0 signals whose amplitude is smaller than AREF . In the situation that the output signal has an amplitude equal to AREF we then consider this signal to have an indefinite logic level. 3.2 Numerical method The system consists of a single three-core PCF with three PAM-ASK modulators and two phase controllers. The coupler physical parameters are: hole diameter of d=2μm, hole-to-hole distance of Λ = d/0.9, core separation of C =2Λ, wavelength near the region of λ=1.55μm and effective area of Aeff =41μm2. The PCF parameters used were β2 =−47ps2/km, β3 =0.1ps3/km, γ=3.2×10−3Wm−1 and γ/ω=2.6×10−18s/Wm [11,18]. The coupled-mode equations were solved using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. We used a step of h=0.00001 and a time window of 7385.254fs divided into 512 temporal grid points. The reference frame moves with the pulse at the group velocity ( v g ) and the time is given by t=t′−z/vg. We used the fundamental soliton propagation [ L ND = L D ] with a full temporal width at half maximum (TFWHM) of the input pulse of Δt=100fs. We neglected the fourth-order dispersion and fiber losses due to the small propagation length (negligible loss regime). In the modulation, we used an offset parameter of | ε | = 6 W 1 / 2 . The peak power of the reference pulse is PREF =4.64kW and the reference amplitude is given by A REF = P REF . We analyzed all the output signals for all possible input combinations. From these, we highlighted the two and three-input OR and AND gates and chose the best ones based on the contrast ratio (CR) between the 0 and 1 bits in the worst case. 4 Results and discussions With an offset parameter of | ε | = 6 W 1 / 2 , couplers with lengths of L=1.08cm and L=1.2cm and the phase controllers Δϕ1 and Δϕ2 ranging from 0 to 2π in 41 points, the pulses inserted into input ports S 1, S 2, and S 3 are modulated in PAM as bits 1 or 0, then passing through the coupler and resulting in output ports S 4, S 5, and S 6. In the output signals demodulation, we analyzed the amplitudes AOUT for all possible input combinations in the truth table. We considered as bit 1 signals with an amplitude greater than the reference amplitude AREF and as bit 0 signals with an amplitude smaller than AREF . We obtained two devices: the first one, with L=1.08cm, resulting in the three-input passive OR(A, B, C) and AND(A, B, C) logic gates, and the second one, with L=1.2cm, resulting in the active two-input OR(A, B) and AND(A, B) logic gates. Here, A, B and C represent the logic states of the input signals in the coupler for cores 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 4.1 First device: three-input passive OR and AND logic gates For the first device, a planar three-core PCF with a length ofL=1.08cm, hole diameter of d=2μm, hole-to-hole distance of Λ≅2.22μm and core separation (between two adjacent cores) of C≅4.44μm, we obtained, as the output of core 3, the passive three-input OR(A, B, C) and AND(A, B, C) logic gates (which are now being demonstrated for the first time when considering PCF with PAM-ASK modulation), where the desired logic operation (AND or OR) is selected by adjusting the phases of the input pulses. The passive three-input OR(A, B, C) logic gate, whose output signals are shown in Fig. 3 a), is obtained with the parameters Δϕ1 =1.0495π and Δϕ2 =0.0975π. Note that the output pulse for input 000 is the only one that is below the reference line, as expected from this logic gate’s truth table. The passive three-input AND(A, B, C) logic gate, whose output signals are shown in Fig. 3b), is obtained with the parameters Δϕ1 =0.901π and Δϕ2 =0.799π. Note that the output pulse for input 111 is the only one that is above the reference line, as expected from this logic gate’s truth table. Both logic gates were obtained at output S 6 (core 3). Table 1 contains some data for the analysis of the AND(A, B, C) and OR(A, B, C) logic gates: the truth table, the offset parameters of the output signals and the contrast ratio, CR, for each output. The output pulse modulation parameter εOUT is the difference between the amplitude of the analyzed output signal and the reference amplitude. εOUT is negative for logic state 0 and positive for logic state 1. The contrast ratio is calculated by CR = 10 log 10 ( P / P R ) , where P is the peak power for each case and PR is the peak power for comparison, which depends on the analyzed logic gate type. For the OR gate, PR is the peak power of the case whose output is bit 0 whereas for the AND gate, PR is the peak power of the case whose output is bit 1 [24]. In the worst case, the contrast ratio between the 0 and 1 output signals is 0.553dB for the OR(A, B, C) gate and 0.364dB for the AND(A, B, C) gate. As in both logic gates worst cases the CR is greater than 0.3dB, there is enough margin for distinguishing the logic signal from the noise in optical detectors. 4.2 Second device: two-input active OR and AND logic gates As we are dealing with a coupler with 3 inputs and 3 outputs, besides the three-input logic gates it is also possible to obtain two-input logic gates. In these gates, only two inputs will be effectively used, the third one being an enable input (or control signal, as seen in Refs. [6] and [12]), which is very common in electronic integrated circuits. The logic gates shown below receive the input pulses into cores 1 and 2 whereas the enable pulse is inserted into core 3. Here, the enable pulse is a hyperbolic secant with a peak power of 4.676kW and a TFWHM of 100 fs (similar to the input pulses). So, for the second device, a planar three-core PCF with a length of L=1.2cm, hole diameter of d=2μm, hole-to-hole distance of Λ≅2.22μm and core separation of C≅4.44μm, we obtained, as the output of core 3, the active two-input OR(A, B) and AND(A, B) logic gates, where the desired logic operation (AND or OR) is selected by adjusting the phases of the input pulses. The active two-input OR(A, B) logic gate, whose output signals are shown in Fig. 4 a), is obtained with the parameters Δϕ1 =2π and Δϕ2 =0.4545π. Note that the output pulse for input 00 is the only one that is below the reference line, as expected from this logic gate’s truth table. The active two-input AND(A, B) logic gate, whose output signals are shown in Fig. 4b), is obtained with the parameters Δϕ1 =0.297π and Δϕ2 =0.4525π. Note that the output pulse for input 11 is the only one that is above the reference line, as expected from this logic gate’s truth table. Both logic gates were obtained at output S 6 (core 3). Table 2 contains some data for the analysis of the AND(A, B) and OR(A, B) logic gates: the truth table, the offset parameters of the output signals and the contrast ratio “CR” for each output. For the OR gate, P R is the peak power of the case whose output is bit 0 whereas for the AND gate, PR is the peak power of the case whose output is bit 1 [24]. In the worst case, the contrast ratio between the 0 and 1 output signals is 1.387dB for the OR(A, B) gate and 1.109dB for the AND(A, B) gate. As in both logic gates worst cases the CR is greater than 0.3dB, there is a significant margin for distinguishing the logic signal from the noise in optical detectors. 5 Conclusion In this work, we numerically demonstrated the acquisition of two all-optical devices that perform the OR and AND logic operations using a planar three-core PCF coupler with solitonic pulses modulated in PAM-ASK. In the first device, L=1.08cm, we found the passive three-input OR(A, B, C) and AND(A, B, C) logic gates, obtained in Δϕ1 =1.0495π, Δϕ2 =0.0975π and Δϕ1 =0.901π, Δϕ2 =0.799π, respectively. In the second device, L=1.2cm, we used core 3 as an enable port, which received an enable input signal, resulting in the active two-input OR(A, B) and AND(A, B) logic gates, obtained in Δϕ1 =2π, Δϕ2 =0.4545π and Δϕ1 =0.297π, Δϕ2 =0.4525π, respectively. All of the logic gates were obtained at output S 6 (core 3) of the coupler. Since most digital light-wave systems employ ASK, due to the need to keep the wavelength of the pulses at λ=1.55μm to minimize losses, the acquisition of optical devices that work using the PAM-ASK modulation is of great interest. All logic gates shown here have contrast ratios greater than 0.3dB, thus having a significant margin for distinguishing the logic signal from the noise in optical detectors. The active two-input logic gates obtained in the second device showed exceptionally high contrast ratios, with 1.3869dB for the OR gate and 1.1091dB for the AND gate. Due to its high contrast ratios, these logic gates are more efficient if compared to other works in literature where the PAM-ASK modulation is used to obtain all-optical logic gates made of PCF [12,13]. The three-input logic gates obtained in the first device are an interesting result for being smaller than the two-input logic gates obtained in this and several other works in literature where conventional fibers and PCFs are used [6,12,13,16,17,25]. This smaller length allows for saving resources and physical space in the creation of more complex optical circuits (in which the occurrence of Boolean expressions like OR(A, B, C) and AND(A, B, C) are very common). For example, using only two-input OR gates, we need 2 cascaded OR gates to obtain the logical expression OR(A, B, C) as output, which takes up more space and has a considerable power loss due to the transition through the two gates. So, by using a three-input OR logic gate we can save space and avoid the problems that come with the cascading of logic gates in the construction of more complex optic circuits.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.073,Impact of multiple usages of digital filters on speckle contrast and phase maps,"Abstract Various digital filters have been use to remove unwanted noise in speckle pattern used in the field of Electronic speckle pattern interferometer (ESPI). However, multiple usages of these digital filters can contribute to significant drop in speckle contrast leading to loss of phase information. This paper reports effect of multiple usages of various digital filters namely, Median, Gaussian and Average on the speckle contrast and ultimately on the phase maps. This study also compares effectiveness of these three digital filters in removing noise from speckle patterns.",Feb-18," Keyword Electronic speckle pattern interferometer Digital filtering Speckle contrast Wrapped and unwrapped phase map 1 Introduction Electronic speckle pattern interferometer (ESPI) is a widely used technique to quantify roughness/deformation of the object. It was first developed by J. Butters, J. Leendertz in 1970 [1]. Nowadays, ESPI technique is used widely to remotely quantify the roughness/deformation of an object. Wide varieties of objects, from soft condensed matter to metallic disk to thin films are probed using the ESPI technique [2–4]. By knowing the phase of the correlation fringe pattern, amplitude of deformation can be calculated. There are various ways developed over the years to determine the phase of the correlation fringe pattern. Among all the ways, temporal phase shifting techniques are popularly used by many researchers [5]. For determining the phase information, high quality speckle patterns are required. Quality of a speckle pattern is generally measured in terms of speckle contrast which is defined as following [6], (1) C = 〈 I 2 〉 − 〈 I 〉 2 〈 I 〉 Where, C is the speckle contrast and I is the intensity. Numerator is the root mean square deviation of the intensity fluctuations and the denominator is average intensity. Value of C lies between 0 and 1, where 0 means no speckle and 1 means image full of speckles. Depending on the usage of imaging system speckle pattern are called objective and subjective. When the imaging system is used then the pattern is called as subjective otherwise it is called as objective. In this paper, speckle patterns are subjective. Generally, difference between speckle patterns obtained from the object with and without deformation is taken into consideration for obtaining correlation fringe pattern. However, speckle pattern obtained directly from the experiment contains noise which can badly influence correlation fringe pattern’s contrast [7]. Various digital filters are used to remove the noise from the speckle pattern [8]. Phase calculation algorithms require digitally filtered speckle pattern before extracting the phase information from the deformed object. Multiple usages of these filters can have adverse effect on the overall speckle contrast. This paper explores the effect of multiple usages of digital filters namely; Median, Gaussian and Average on the speckle contrast and on the phase map. This study also reveals the effectiveness of above mentioned digital filters in removing noise from speckle pattern. Digital filters: Workings of various filters used in this paper are discussed below in brief. Median filter: In the median filter [9,10], a pixel matrix of suppose 3×3 is chosen. Then the middle pixel’s gray value is readjusted according to the rest of the elements in that matrix. For example, below (Eq. (2)) is the 3×3 window containing ‘6′ as a middle pixel’s gray value. After application of median filter it is now changed to 5. As it is clear from the working of this filter it does not changes the image area. (2) [ 7 3 4 8 6 _ 1 5 9 2 ] M e d i a n f i l t e r ⇒ [ 7 3 4 8 5 _ 1 5 9 2 ] This filter is very useful to filter out the unwanted speckle noise from the digital speckle pattern. Gaussian filter: This filter is described by the Gaussian distribution curve (Eq. (3)) [9]. Digital image is nothing but two dimensional arrays of x and y pixel elements. Two dimensional Gaussian distribution can be expressed as: (3) G ( x , y ) = 1 2 π σ e x 2 + y 2 2 σ 2 where, σ is a standard deviation. Average filter: This filter averages pixel to pixel gray value variations. In the average filtering, we have used convolution operation which depends on the kernel size. Kernel represents the shape and sizes of the neighborhood pixels to calculate the mean [11]. Larger kernel is used if more blurring is required. In general kernel sizes vary from 3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 and so on. This paper explores the effect of multiple usages of digital filters namely; Median, Gaussian and Average on the speckle contrast. This study also reveals the effectiveness of above mentioned digital filters in removing noise from speckle pattern. 2 Experimental setup Experimental set up of ESPI is as shown in Fig. 1 . Light from the laser was first divided into two half using a beam splitter. One beam is used to illuminate the object surface in the full-field manner using spatial filter assembly. The illuminated object thus forms speckle pattern which contains information about the surface of object (Stainless Steel Plate). The speckle pattern was then collected with a zoom lens and imaged on to the digital camera. The digital camera is having following specifications; 1/4-inch CMOS sensor, Array element: 1280×1024, Pixel sizes: 2.8×2.8μm and Maximum frame rate: 7.5fps. Second beam (reference beam), after reflecting from series of mirrors whose paths are matched with the first beam, was made to diverge and superimposed with the light reflected from the object via beam splitter on the camera. Both wave fronts back scattered from the object and of the reference beam interfere and form a speckle pattern. This speckle pattern of object is digitized and stored in a computer. 3 Result and discussion Digital filters namely, Median, Gaussian and Average (with kernel as 3×3 and 7×7) were applied to the speckle pattern obtained in the experiment. Speckle pattern was converted into grayscale for further processing. Speckle contrast of unfiltered speckle pattern was calculated using Eq. (1). Various digital filters as mentioned above were applied to the speckle pattern individually and repeatedly. Speckle contrast, after every application of respective filtering, was calculated. Speckle contrast of speckle images is found to be decreasing after every application of digital filters. Fig. 2 shows the effect of various digital filters on speckle contrast. Fig. 3 shows the modulation in intensities of pixel values due to application of Median, Gaussian and Average (with kernel as 3×3 and 7×7) filter. Fig. 4 clearly shows substantial decrease in the speckle contrast after application of digital filters fifteen times. Among the three filters used, Gaussian filter yield least decrease in speckle contrast with multiple usages. After approximately 5th iteration of each filter, speckle contrast assumes a nearly constant value which does not change further with iterations. After Gaussian, Median is the second best in keeping high value of speckle contrast followed by average filter using 3×3 kernel. Fig. 5 shows the wrapped and unwrapped phase map obtained from the unfiltered speckle images via five step phase shifting algorithm [12] of electronic speckle pattern interferometer. After unwrapping this phase map, one can calculate the amount of deformation of the object. As it can be seen from Fig. 5, large amount of noise is present in wrapped and unwrapped phase maps. Hence it is very difficult to obtained authenticate phase information from it. In fact, unwrapped phase map is totally blinded by noise as seen from Fig. 5. Hence it very necessary to remove noise from it. For this multiple digital filters such as Gaussian, median and average digital filters which are discussed above can be used to remove this unwanted noise from the wrapped phase map. Fig. 6 shows the wrapped and unwrapped phase map after applying the various digital filters such as Gaussian filter, median digital filter and average digital filters with different kernals on it. As it is seen from Fig. 6 when the average filter with kernel 3Χ3 is applied on the speckle images prior to applying five step phase shifting algorithm to get wrapped and unwrapped phase map, then it clearly shows improvement as compared to Fig. 5. After applying the same filter five times on the speckle images, improvement is clearly visible compared to Fig. 6a on the wrapped and unwrapped phase map as shown in Fig. 6b. This is in tune with the speckle contrast decrease as shown in Fig. 4. Similar results are for average filter with 7×7 kernal size as shown in Fig. 6c and d. Fig. 6e and f shows the wrapped and unwrapped phase map after deploying Gaussian filter once and five times to clean speckle images respectively. It certainly shows improvement over Fig. 5 but if it is compared with results of average filter then it can be concluded that Gaussian filter is less effective in removing noise. But Gaussian filter is more effective in maintaining ‘speckleness’ of the images as compared to average and median filter. This can also be concluded from Fig. 4. Similar results are for median filter as shown in Fig. 6g and h which shows wrapped and unwrapped phase map after deploying the filter once and five times on the speckle images. Using median filter once reduces the noise more efficiently compared to Gaussian filter as it is obvious from Figs. 6 e,g and 4. However after five iterations of the respective filters, noise reduction is almost same as visible from Figs. 6f,h and 4. Hence all the results shown in Fig. 4 correlates to Fig. 6. 4 Conclusion Different filters were compared by calculating speckle contrast and wrapped and unwrapped phase maps. Effectiveness of various filters in removing noise and maintaining speckleness were compared. Results obtained in this context from speckle constrast calculation and after application of filters prior to calculation of phase maps correlates with each other. We found that Gaussian filter works best among the median and average filter in keeping the speckleness of the pattern along with removing the unwanted noise. Median filter also scores well along with Gaussian filter after multiple usages. Whereas it is found that average filter gives the best result among these removing unwanted noise from the speckle pattern but it largely affect the speckle contrast. Speckle contrast hovers around a constant value after approximately five applications of every filter. ", [1] J. Butters J.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.012,Numerical modeling of pulse propagation through a double-negative metamaterial with adjacent absorptive and gain Lorentz dispersions: A comparison,"Abstract The state-of-the-art time-domain numerical techniques, the finite-deference time-domain (FDTD) method and the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method, are applied to simulate the physical propagation process of a pulse through a double-negative metamaterial with adjacent absorptive and gain Lorentz dispersions. The algorithmic feasibility and modeling accuracy of the two numerical methods combined with the common techniques for Lorentz dispersion implementation are demonstrated from the obtained simulation results and compared with the analytical solution. It is shown that the FDTD method with material parameters averaged at the slab’s two interfaces works better than that without averaging and also better than the case of PSTD method with the same time and space discretization parameters. The proposed techniques are useful for the ultra-accurate modeling of pulse interaction with metamaterials.",Feb-18," Keywords Finite-deference time-domain method Pseudospectral time-domain method Metamaterial Pulse propagation 1 Introduction A sufficient requirement for a negative refractive index is that both the permittivity and permeability are simultaneously negative [1]. A medium having such a property is often called a double-negative material or, more traditionally but less rigorously, a left-handed material. Although a negative-index material is not naturally available, electric and magnetic dipoles in the artificial materials operating in the effective medium limit have been shown to exhibit an effective negative refractive index [2]. Of great interest, a negative index media with zero loss at a specific operating frequency would potentially allow a perfect imaging [3], which foreshows its wide applications in microscopy, semiconductor device processing, and optical memories [4]. There has been reported to use gain to offset loss and therefore it is possible to achieve a zero loss operating condition through a mixture of two semiconductor quantum dots and with the permittivity and permeability both being real and negative [5]. In this work, both the finite-deference time-domain (FDTD) method [6] and the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method [7] are applied to accurately modeling a type of Lorentz metamaterials with adjacent loss and gain resonances. The PSTD method seems superior to the FDTD method in view of the fact that in the former algorithm, both electric and magnetic field components locate at the same location within a cell. This advantage circumvents the ensuing problems, such as the artificial transition layers at the object’s boundaries [8] due to the staggering field components applied in the algorithms like the FDTD method. Unfortunately, the PSTD method is weak in representing the abrupt change of electromagnetic field at an interface, say, between the free space and a double-negative metamaterial. It would introduce spurious aliasing errors on the electromagnetic field on all cells within the computational space, which is also the reason why a spatially smoothed source is required in order to excite electromagnetic waves in the PSTD method [9]. The FDTD algorithm doesn’t have such a phenomenon due to the fact that the spatial derivatives are calculated from the field values on two adjacent cells. Furthermore, the artificial transition layer occurring in the FDTD algorithm can be efficiently alleviated by using smaller size of spatial cells or applying spatial averaging at the boundaries [10]. Therefore it is of interest to investigate whether the FDTD method with or without material parameter averaging at the two interfaces outperforms the PSTD method in modeling this special type of metamaterials. For the negative vales of permittivity and permeability cannot be directly assigned into the FDTD or PSTD updating equations, the dispersion-implementation approach must be incorporated into them to model such a highly-dispersive metamaterial and herewith we utilize the piecewise linear recursive convolution (PLRC) algorithm as it is accurate in simulating various metamaterials with multiple Debye or Lorentz dispersions [11]. 2 System configuration The configuration of the system studied is shown in Fig. 1 , where Regions I and III are the free space with ε1 =ε3 = 1, and μ1 =μ3 = 1. A flat slab of thickness d occupies Region II between the interfaces x = x 1 and x=x1 +d, and infinitely extends in both y and z directions. The source is placed in the left part of Region I to generate the incident pulse. Detector 1 is placed in the right-hand side of the source to record the temporal waveform of incident pulse when the slab is removed, which avoids the influence of the reflected pulse from the slab’s interfaces. As an accurate reference, this detector is set at the origin of x axis for the sake of mathematical convenience. Detector 2 is utilized to record the waveform of pulse transmitting through the plane x = x2 . The whole computational space is truncated by the uniaxial perfectly-matched layers (UPML) at both ends to absorb the outgoing waves [12]. The flat slab is made from the type of special metamaterial with the material parameters proposed in Ref. [5], whose relative permittivity and permeability has an identical dispersion model with impedance matched to free space and given by (1) ε r ( ω ) = μ r ( ω ) = 1 + ∑ m = 1 2 ( − 1 ) m + 1 ω p m 2 ω 0 m 2 − j 2 ω δ m − ω 2 , where ω p1 and ω p2 are the two plasma angular frequencies, ω 01 and ω 02 are the resonance angular frequencies; δ 1 and δ 2 are the damping or gain coefficients, respectively. The other material parameters in the numerical simulations are f 01 = ω 01/2π = 3GHz, f 02 = ω 02/2π = 1.5f 01, δ 1 = δ 2 = ( ω 02 − ω 01 ) 2 / 8 , ω p 1 = ω p 2 = ( ω 02 3 − ω 01 3 ) / ( ω 01 + ω 02 ) . Under this set of material parameters, the ‘perfect’ frequency for this metamaterial is (2) f p = ω p / 2 π = ( ω 01 2 + ω 02 2 ) / ( 8 π 2 ) = 3.8243 GHz , at which frequency the condition εr(ωp) = μr (ωp) =−1 for a perfect lens is satisfied [3]. The relative permittivity and the permeability, as well as the complex refractive index, share the same expression given by (1) and are illustrated in Fig. 2 as functions of frequency, where the ‘perfect’ frequency fp is exclusively marked. Apparently, such a metamaterial is absorptive in the frequency range below fp , while active at the frequencies above f p. In the frequency region near fp , the imaginary part is nearly linear but quite steep, implying a dramatic transition of the property of medium from loss to gain. The analytical solution to the complex transmission coefficient in frequency domain is given by (3) T ( ω ) = exp { j ω [ n ( ω ) d + ( x 2 − d ) ] / c 0 } , where c 0 is the speed of light in free space, n(ω) = Re[n(ω)] + jIm[n(ω)] is the complex refractive index of metamaterial. On the other hand, based on the simulation results about the waveforms recorded by Detector 1 and Detector 2, the numerical counterpart of T(ω) can be calculated by dividing the discrete spectrum of transmitting pulse E 2 (t) by that of incident pulse E 1 (t), (4) T ˜ ( ω ) = DFT { E 2 ( t ) } / DFT { E 1 ( t ) } , where DFT represents the discrete Fourier transform. Combing Eq. (4) with Eq. (3), we have the real and imaginary parts of the numerical refractive index, (5) Re [ n ˜ ( ω ) ] = { A r g [ T ˜ ( ω ) ] c 0 / ω − ( x 2 − d ) } / d , (6) a n d Im [ n ˜ ( ω ) ] = − ln ( | T ˜ ( ω ) | ) c 0 / ( ω d ) . As the refractive index is a crucially important parameter that would affect the slab’s performance in subwavelength imaging, the difference between the numerical refractive index calculated from each of numerical techniques and its exact analytical solution given by Eq. (1) is emphasized in the following discussions. 3 Simulation results To evaluate the accuracy of the aforementioned numerical techniques in modeling the type of metamaterial described by Eq. (1), we should calculate the numerical refractive index according to Eqs. (5) and (6) from the simulation results by simulating the pulse propagation through a flat slab made of such a metamaterial and then compare it with the analytical exact refractive index. Because the amplification coefficient assigned for the metamaterial is relatively large, the slab is set with a relatively small thickness, say, one-tenth of the ‘perfect’ wavelength, d= 0.1λp . The other parameters used in the simulations are cell size Δx = λp/410 and time step size Δt = Δz/(2c0 ), as to meet the Courant stability conditions both for the FDTD and PSTD algorithms. The total number of cells is N = 1024 and the number of time steps performed is 30,000. The incident wave is a Gaussian-derivative pulse with a wide frequency spectrum having a maximum value at 2.5GHz and down to 0.001 of the maximum amplitude at 10.5GHz. The spatially smoothed source is spanning across five cells indexed from 298 to 302, while the flat slab occupies cells indexed from 700 to 740 with a thickness of 41Δx. Detector 1 is placed at the 679th cell and Detector 2 at the 761st cell, both being 20.5Δx far away from the flat slab’s front and back interfaces, respectively. Further suppose that the incident pulse propagates in the positive x-axis direction and passes through Detector 1 with a temporal waveform of z-polarized electric field as depicted in Fig. 3 (a) with a solid line. Based on Eqs. (3)–(5), the temporal waveform of the transmitted pulse received by Detector 2 can be analytically calculated and shown in Fig. 3(a) by a dashed line up to time step 12,000, which is equivalent to 3.83ns in physical time. The spectrum magnitudes of the incident pulse and the analytically calculated transmitting pulse are plotted in Fig. 3(b). As expected, the components of waves pertaining to the frequency range of gain resonance are amplified while absorbed in the frequency range of loss resonance. In Fig. 4 , we show the errors of the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index obtained by using the FDTD method with and without averaging of permittivity at the slab’s interfaces and the PSTD method, respectively, as compared to the analytical exact solution. The magnitudes of amplitude of error from the FDTD method are at the order of 10−4, while it is at the order of 10−3 from the PSTD method. Relatively larger values of error are notified around the maximum gain and loss resonance frequencies, 3GHz and 4.5GHz, respectively for all the numerical schemes. The primary error of the FDTD method comes from the wave reflection on the slab’s interfaces as a result of the spurious transition layers due to the staggering field components in the Yee lattices. The averaging of permittivity at the slab’s interfaces alleviates this situation and it is evident, as we can see from Fig. 4, that the error is greatly suppressed to a level about one-fifth of that without averaging, especially in the frequency range near the gain resonance. In a common sense, the PSTD method performs better than the FDTD method in modeling the conventional media given that the same cell size is applied [7]. However, it may be not very suitable for modeling a double-negative metamaterial like the one we discussed in this work as we can see from Fig. 4. The magnitude of error from the PSTD is even larger than that from the FDTD method without averaging on the slab’s boundaries. Although the reflectionfrom the slab’s interfaces is removed under the PSTD formulation, the discrete Fourier transform algorithm it based to calculate the spatial derivatives is quite questionable in representing an abrupt change of the slopes of the electromagnetic fields. In Fig. 5 , we illustrate the introduced aliasing errors upon the electric field in the whole computational region at time step 3300 under the PSTD simulation and this fact contaminates the correct simulation results. Thus, for a fine sampling of time and space such as at the order of about 200 cells per shortest wavelength, the PSTD method is worse than the FDTD method in modeling this type of double-negative metamaterial. Although the aliasing errors can be suppressed by using a larger computational domain for the PSTD algorithm, the stringent requirement of memory and computing time would be prohibitive for practical applications. Moreover, the PSTD method is also problematical in constructing a sharp and compact object that contains fine and detailed information ready to be imaged by a flat metamaterial slab to evaluate its ability in subwavelength imaging. 4 Conclusion In this work, both the FDTD and PSTD methods are applied to accurately modeling the pulse propagation through a flat slab made of a double-negative metamaterial with adjacent Lorentz absorptive and gain dispersions. We find that for a relatively fine discretization of time and space, the PSTD scheme loses its superiority over the FDTD scheme due to the aliasing errors caused by its incompetent representation of electromagnetic fields as the result of the abrupt change of the electromagnetic fields’ slopes at the slab's two interfaces. We also conclude that the FDTD method with material parameter averaging at the slab’s interfaces would be a good choice of the time-domain numerical techniques developed so far for modeling this type of double-negative metamaterials.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.027,Novel singular solitons in optical metamaterials for self-steepening effect,"Abstract We consider the evolution of ultrashort pulses in metamaterials wherein the pulse propagation is governed by the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation with higher-order effects such as pseudo-quintic nonlinearity and self-steepening effect. We present three new types of exact singular soliton-like solutions for the model in the presence of the self-steepening term, whose phase chirping varies as a function of the pulse intensity.

Parametric conditions on physical parameters for the existence of the novel structures are also presented. Particular cases are discussed.",Feb-18," OCIS 060.2310 060.4510 060.5530 190.3270 190.4370 Keywords Singular solitons Metamaterials Self-steepening 1 Introduction Propagation of soliton pulses in optical fibers has received a great deal of attention in recent years [1–6]. In particular, exact soliton-like or quasi-soliton solutions including bright and dark quasi-solitons, dark-like-bright solitons and double-kink solitons have been shown to exist under certain parametric conditions on the fiber parameters [1–6]. However, the study of quasi-solitons dynamics in metamaterials (MMs) with dispersive permittivity and dispersive permeability has received little attention. Regarding such a problem, Yang et al. [7] considered a generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) describing the propagation of ultrashort pulses in MMs and present three new types of exact bright, dark, bright-grey quasi-solitons in the very specific condition of the vanishing self-steepening parameter. But when the soliton pulse width becomes ultrashort (<100fs) and subsequently the higher-order effects can not be neglected, the effect of self-steepening on solitons becomes an important issue in optical systems [8]. We mention that the self-steepening, otherwise called the Kerr dispersion, is due to the intensity dependence of group velocity [9]. In practice, such a physically important effect causes an asymmetrical spectral broadening of the pulse and distort the wave forms. Furthermore, self-steepening can develop an optical shock, perceived as an extremely sharp near edge [10]. However, in the presence of both dispersion and the Kerr nonlinear effect, solitons can be found that are robust against the shock formation [8]. In most of the problems of practical interest, the self-steepening effect plays a significant role in the propagation of femtosecond pulses. Thus, it is important to investigate the propagation properties of optical solitons in the presence of this effect since the latter will essentially influence the physical features of propagating pulses. In this paper, we investigate for the first time to our knowledge the propagation characteristics of singular soliton-like in metamaterials under the influence of the self-steepening effect. It is remarked that the self-steepening term has profound influence on the parameters of solitons. We also show that the nonlinear chirp associated with these optical solitons is directly proportional to the pulse intensity. We further discuss the properties of solitons in the absence of self-steepening term. 2 Governing model The generalized NLSE with higher-order effects governing the propagation of ultrashort pulses in MMs is given by [7] (1) i ∂ ψ ∂ z + k 2 2 ∂ 2 ψ ∂ t 2 + p 3 ψ 2 ψ − p 5 ψ 4 ψ − is 1 ∂ ∂ t ψ 2 ψ = 0 , where ψ(z, t) is the complex envelope of the electric field, t = cT/λ p and z = Z/λ p are the respective normalized time and propagation distance, where λ p is the plasma wavelength. k 2 stands for the group-velocity dispersion (GVD), while p 3, p 5 and s 1 denote the cubic, pseudo-quintic nonlinearity and the self-steepening effect, respectively. Eq. (1) for p 5 = s 1 =0 reduces to the NLSE which has only the terms describing lowest order dispersion and self-phase modulation [11,12]. In the limit p 5 =0, Eq. (1) describes the derivative NLSE [8]. In absence of the self-steepening term s 1 = 0 , Eq. (1) becomes the well-known cubic–quintic NLSE [13]. It is of interest to find propagating envelope solutions in metamaterials governed by the model (1). To obtain the exact soliton solutions of Eq. (1), we consider a solution of the form (2) ψ ( z , t ) = ρ ξ e i κ z − Ω t − θ ξ , where ξ = t − χt is the traveling coordinate, while ρ and χ are real functions of the traveling coordinate ξ. It is worth noting that when θ ξ = 0 , the phase function in (2) [i.e., κ z − Ω t − θ ξ ] reduces to the same form as in Ref. [7], which leads to quasi-soliton solutions found under the condition of the vanishing self-steepening term. If we put Ω=0 in Eq. (2), the solution reduces to the complex envelope traveling-wave solution used by Alka et al. [1], to find chirped dark, bright and double-kink solitons in optical fibers. For the present work, we are interested by singular soliton-like solutions in metamaterials which have nontrivial phase structure depending on the wave intensity. Notice that, with introducing the general solution (2), we have established a unifying representation for searching exact solutions with nontrivial phase chirping for higher-order NLS models. Obviously, the corresponding chirping is given by δ ω ( z , t ) = − ∂ / ∂ t κ z − Ω t − θ ξ = Ω + θ ′ ξ . Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1) and separating the real and imaginary parts, we find the pair of coupled equations in ρ and θ, (3) − κ + χ θ ′ ρ + k 2 2 ρ ′ ′ − Ω + θ ′ 2 ρ + p 3 ρ 3 − p 5 ρ 5 − s 1 Ω + θ ′ ρ 3 = 0 , and (4) − χ ρ ′ − k 2 Ω + θ ′ ρ ′ − k 2 2 ρ θ ′ ′ − 3 s 1 ρ 2 ρ ′ = 0 , where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to ξ. Eq. (4) can be exactly integrated to yield: (5) θ ′ = − Ω + χ k 2 − 3 s 1 2 k 2 ρ 2 , The corresponding chirping takes the form: δ ω z , t = − ( χ / k 2 ) − ( 3 s 1 / 2 k 2 ) ρ 2 . This shows that the chirp associated with propagating pulses is an intensity dependent function (with I = ψ 2 = ρ 2 being the intensity) and includes both linear and nonlinear contributions. We also see that δ ω z , t depends essentially on the self-steepening parameter s 1 in addition to the group velocity dispersion coefficient k 2. Further substitution of the expression (5) into Eq. (3) gives a dynamical equation describing the evolution of the wave amplitude in the metamaterial as (6) ρ ′ ′ − 2 κ k 2 + Ω 2 − Ω + χ k 2 2 ρ + 2 p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ k 2 2 ρ 3 − 2 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 8 k 2 2 ρ 5 = 0 , Multiplying (6) by ρ′ and integrating with respect to ξ, we get (7) ρ ′ 2 = b 0 + b 2 ρ 2 − b 4 ρ 4 + b 6 ρ 6 , where (8a) b 2 = 2 κ k 2 + Ω 2 − Ω + χ k 2 2 , (8b) b 4 = p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ k 2 2 , (8c) b 6 = 2 3 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 8 k 2 2 . and b 0 being an arbitrary integration constant. Eq. (7) is an elliptic equation which is known to admit a variety of solutions including periodic, kink, and solitary-wave-type solutions. In this paper, we report new types of singular soliton-like solutions under different parametric conditions. 3 Singular solitons in MMs In this section, we present three new types of singular soliton-like solutions of the model (1) in the presence of self-steepening term, based on solving Eq. (7) under certain parametric conditions. The explicit solutions and corresponding chirping are given below. 3.1 TYPE-I For b 0 =0, we have find a first new singular soliton-like solution of Eq. (7) of the form (9) ρ ξ = A csch η ξ 1 + B csch 2 η ξ , where (10a) A = 12 B ( 1 − B ) p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ ( 1 − 2 B ) 8 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 , (10b) η = A − p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ ( 1 − 2 B ) k 2 2 , (10c) κ = k 2 2 η 2 − Ω 2 + Ω + χ k 2 2 , provided that B ( 1 − 2 B ) p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ 8 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 > 0 and ( 1 − 2 B ) p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ < 0 , with the necessary condition B <1. Based upon the above finding, we obtain a first nonlinearly chirped singular soliton-like solution of Eq. (1) in the presence of self-steepening effect of the form (11) ψ ( z , t ) = A csch η t − χ t 1 + B csch 2 η t − χ t e i κ z − Ω t − θ ξ , where the soliton parameters A, η and κ obey relations (10), while the frequency shift Ω is an arbitrary constant. From Eq. (10) which represent analytical relations among parameters of the singular soliton, one can see that these parameters are directly related to the self-steepening coefficient s 1. The corresponding chirping is given by (12) δ ω z , t = − χ k 2 − 3 s 1 A 2 csch 2 η t − χ t 2 k 2 1 + B csch 2 η t − χ t . 3.1.1 Chirp-free singular quasi-solitons (TYPE-I) Here, we study particular solutions of Eq. (1) when the parameter of the phase modification θ ξ = 0 in (2). For this case, the phase function reduces to κz −Ωt, which has been used in Ref. [7]. By putting θ ξ = 0 in Eq. (4), we obtain the relation χ =−Ωk 2 and the condition s 1 =0. The latter implies that propagating envelopes in the metamaterial will be found in the limit of the vanishing self-steepening effect. Under this condition, the formulas in Eq. (10) can be reduced to the form: (13a) A = 3 B ( 1 − B ) p 3 2 ( 1 − 2 B ) p 5 , (13b) η = A − p 3 ( 1 − 2 B ) k 2 , (13c) κ = k 2 2 η 2 − Ω 2 , Then a direct substitution of these results in (11) provides a new solution describing an unchirped singular quasi-soliton solution for Eq. (1) as follows: (14) ψ ( z , t ) = A csch η t − χ t 1 + B csch 2 η t − χ t e i κ z − Ω t , where A, η and κ satisfy relations (13). From Eqs. (13a) and (13b), one must require B(1−2B)p 3 p 5 >0 and (1−2B)k 2 p 3 <0 together with the condition B <1 for the solution (14) to exist. 3.2 TYPE-II For an arbitrary integration constant b 0 ≠0, Eq. (7) admits another new singular soliton-like solution of the form (15) ρ ξ = A coth η ξ 1 + B csch 2 η ξ , where (16a) A = 12 B p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ ( 2 B + 1 ) 8 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 , (16b) η = A B − 1 p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ ( 2 B + 1 ) k 2 2 , (16c) κ = k 2 2 B + 2 B − 1 η 2 − Ω 2 + Ω + χ k 2 2 , provided that B ( 2 B + 1 ) p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ 8 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 > 0 and ( 2 B + 1 ) p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ > 0 , with the necessary condition B >1. Making use of these findings, we can present the second family of singular soliton-like solution with nonlinear chirp of Eq. (1) as (17) ψ ( z , t ) = A coth η ξ 1 + B csch 2 η ξ e i κ z − Ω t − θ ξ , where A, η and κ are given by the relations (16). The corresponding chirping takes the form (18) δ ω z , t = − χ k 2 − 3 s 1 A 2 coth 2 η t − χ t 2 k 2 1 + B csch 2 η t − χ t . 3.2.1 Chirp-free singular quasi-solitons (TYPE-II) In the case of θ ξ = 0 in (2), Eq. (4) yields the relation χ =−Ωk 2 and the condition s 1 =0. Under these conditions, Eq. (17) simplifies to the following singular quasi-soliton solution: (19) ψ ( z , t ) = A coth η ξ 1 + B csch 2 η ξ e i ( κ z − Ω t ) , where the parameters A, η, and κ are now (20a) A = 3 Bp 3 2 ( 2 B + 1 ) p 5 , (20b) η = A B − 1 p 3 ( 2 B + 1 ) k 2 , (20c) κ = k 2 2 B + 2 B − 1 η 2 − Ω 2 , From Eqs. (20a) and (20b), necessary conditions for the existence of the preceding solution can be obtained as B(2B +1)p 3 p 5 >0 and (2B +1)p 3 k 2 >0. 3.3 TYPE-III For an arbitrary nonzero integration constant b 0, we have found an exact singular soliton-like solution of Eq. (7) as (21) ρ ξ = A 1 + B coth 2 η ξ , where (22a) A = 12 1 + B p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ ( 3 + B ) 8 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 , (22b) η = A − B p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ ( 1 + B ) 3 + B k 2 2 , (22c) κ = − k 2 2 2 η 2 + Ω 2 + 3 η 2 B − Ω + χ k 2 2 , provided that p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ 8 p 5 k 2 − 3 s 1 2 > 0 and B p 3 k 2 + s 1 χ < 0 with the primary requirement B >−1. We then obtain the following chirped singular soliton-like solution for Eq. (1): (23) ψ ( z , t ) = A 1 + B coth 2 η ξ e i κ z − Ω t − θ ξ , The corresponding chirping is given by (24) δ ω z , t = − χ k 2 − 3 s 1 A 2 2 k 2 1 + B coth 2 η t − χ t . where A, η and κ are given by the relations (22). 3.3.1 Chirp-free singular quasi-solitons (TYPE-III) If we set θ ξ = 0 in (2), then Eq. (4) yields the relation χ =−Ωk 2 and the condition s 1 =0. In this case, Eq. (23) simplifies to the following unchirped singular quasi-soliton solution: (25) ψ ( z , t ) = A 1 + B coth 2 ( η ξ ) e i ( κ z − Ω t ) where the parameters A, η and κ are given by (26a) A = 3 ( 1 + B ) p 3 2 ( 3 + B ) p 5 , (26b) η = A − Bp 3 ( 1 + B ) 3 + B k 2 , (26c) κ = − k 2 2 2 η 2 + Ω 2 + 3 η 2 B , (26d) χ = − Ω k 2 Necessary conditions for the existence of this solution can be obtained from Eqs. (26a and 26b) as p 3 p 5 >0, Bp 3 k 2 <0, and B >−1. 4 Conclusion We have investigated a generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation with higher-order effects such as pseudoquintic nonlinearity and self-steepening, describing the propagation of ultrashort pulses in metamaterials. We analytically solved the model by means of the coupled amplitude-phase formulation in the presence of self-steepening term. This is of great importance because ultrashort optical pulses propagation in nonlinear media necessarily require the self-steepening term in the governing equation. Three new types of exact singular soliton-like solutions having nontrivial phase chirping which varies as directly proportional to the pulse intensity are presented. Furthermore, the nonlinear chirp associated with each of these newly envelope solutions is also determined. Exact unchirped singular quasi-soliton solutions have been found under the condition of vanishing self-steepening parameter. Conditions for the existence of these structures are reported.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.025,Effect of Fe substitution on optical and magnetic properties of CeO2 nanoparticles,"Abstract Pure and iron doped cerium oxide nanoparticles (Ce1-xFexO2) at x=0.00, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05 were synthesised using ball milling method and subjected to their microstructural, optical and magnetic properties. Face centred cubic structure was found for (Ce1-xFexO2) nanoparticles at x=0.00, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05 and no evidence of impurities were found from X-ray diffraction patterns. The surface morphology and chemical compositions of the nanoparticles were studied using FE-SEM attached with EDAX and found that the nanoparticles were almost in spherical shape with nearly stoichiometric ratios. The optical band gap of the nanoparticles were calculated and found increase with Fe doping concentration. The pure CeO2 nanoparticles exhibited a magnetization of 0.0043 emu/g and coercivity of 400Oe. The magnetic moment is found to increase with increase of doping. The (Ce1-xFexO2) nanoparticles at x=0.05 exhibited the magnetization of 0.07 emu/g and coercivity of 491Oe which are far higher values when compared with that of undoped CeO2 nanoparticles.",Feb-18," Keywords X-Ray diffraction Transparent conducting oxides Solid state reaction 1 Introduction Oxide semiconductors such as indium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, etc were studied extensively for their suitable applications in many of the optoelectronic applications. These oxide semiconductors possess peculiar properties such as wide band gap, high stability, high carrier density, high conductivity along with transmittance. Since Dietl et al. [1] and Mastumoto et al. [2] proved the existence of ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors at room temperature, intensive interest has been initiated on magnetic properties of different oxide semiconductors. These oxide semiconductors find numerous applications in spintronic devices [3–5]. Hence intensive interest has been put on the wide band gap oxide semiconductors synthesised either in the bulk form or in thin films form. They are found to exhibit ferromagnetism at room temperature, also the proper reason for the origin of the room temperature ferromagnetism in these materials have been explained [6–11]. One of the most important oxide semiconductor falls under rare earth category namely, Cerium Oxide. They are wide band gap material exhibiting cubic structure of fluorine type possessing with a lattice constant a=0.5411nm. It finds application in silicon based microelectronic devices along with other spintronics devices [12,13]. It has the unique feature of maintaining its cubic structure during switching over of its oxidation states. It exhibit ferromagnetism with Curie temperature above the room temperature with moderate electrical conductivity. Hence CeO2 gathers more interest as an alternative of other wide band gap oxide semiconductors for spintronics applications of dilute magnetic oxides. Moreover, CeO2 nanomaterials exhibited peculiar physical and chemical properties which are quite different from their bulk counterparts. Hence CeO2 in different nano structures have attracted much attention recently. It find applications in gas sensors, radiation detectors, electrochromic devices catalysis, hybrid solar cells, oxygen storage capacity, solid state electrolytes, abrasives for chemical–mechanical planarization, sun screens for ultraviolet absorbents, the adsorption and reaction of formaldehyde, UV blockers and filters, glass polishing materials, acts as antioxidants [14–19] etc. Hence in order to prepare the nanostructured CeO2, different physical and chemical synthesis method such as microemulsion, sol-gel, so no chemical, low temperature solution combustion method, electrochemical, solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis methods have been applied to synthesize CeO2 nanostructures [20–29]. Each of the method has its own advantage and limitation. As the magnetic properties are depend on synthesis method, dopant, doping concentration, defects, oxygen vacancies it is very important to take care of all these aspects. These aspects were taken into the account during synthesis of nanoparticles such that no unintentional impurities are present in the material [30]. Hence in order to prepare the impurity free CeO2 nanoparticles, here we have adopted simple ball milling method and studied the microstructural, optical and magnetic properties of undoped and Fe doped CeO2 nanoparticle. 2 Experimental Commercially available CeO2 and Fe2O3 (M/S Sigma-Aldrich 99.99% pure) are taken in accurate quantity to convert it into fine powders using ball milling method. Pure and irondoped CeO2 nanoparticles (Ce1-xFexO2) at x=0.00, 0.01, 0.3 and 0.05 concentrations has been prepared by a simple mechanical milling method. The millings were carried out for two and half hours continuously at 360 r.p.min planetary Mono mill (PULVERISETTE 6 Classic line) with 5mm grinding balls. After that, the samples were sintered at 800°C for 6h. A detailed study on structural aspects has been done by X-ray diffraction (X-ray diffractometer, D8 Advance, BRUKER). The elemental studies were carried out with the help of FE-SEM and Energy dispersive analysis spectroscopy(EDS) (OXFORD instrument incapenta FET X3). In order to divulge into the optical properties, UV–vis-NIR Spectrophotometer (JASCO V-670) has been used in diffuse reflectance mode. Vibrating sample magnetometer (Lake Shore-7410) helped in understanding the magnetic behaviour of the samples. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Structural properties Fig. 1 (a) shows the X-ray diffraction profile of the Fe2O3 and of Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles. In the figure, the bottom layer indicates the XRD profile of Fe2O3. The diffraction peaks such as (0 1 2), (1 0 4), (1 1 0), (1 1 3), (0 2 4), (1 1 6), (1 2 2), (2 1 4) and (3 0 0) were found in their respective diffraction angles. These are in good agreement with that of standard XRD pattern of α-Fe2O3 derived from the JCPDS Card No. 33-664 [31]. From this the structure of the nanoparticles was found to be in rhombohedral structure. No other diffraction peaks related to either FeO or Fe3O4 were found in the profile indicating that the source material is pure from any kind of impurities. From the second layer onwards in Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD profiles of Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles at different Fe doping concentrations. The diffraction peaks such as (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (3 3 1), (2 0 0) and (4 2 0) were observed at 28.57°, 33.05°, 47.49°, 56.09°, 59.23°, 69.49°, 76.79°, 79.11° and 88.34° respectively. All the diffraction peaks observed here were coincided with face centred cubic structure of CeO2 [JCPDS34-0394]. The diffraction peaks sharp indicating good crystallinity of the prepared samples. Diffraction peaks related to Fe2O3 were not observed here even if the doping concentration of Fe increased from x=0.00 to x=0.05. The intensity of the diffraction peaks decreased with increase of doping concentration. The decrease in intensity of the diffraction peaks might be due to obstructing the growth of CeO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 1(b) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles at different Fe doping concentration in the diffraction angle range of 28°–34°. From the figure it is clear that the diffraction peak positions slightly differ from pure CeO2 and Fe doped CeO2. The difference is the shifting of diffraction peaks towards higher angles with increase of doping concentration but at x=0.05 the diffraction peak again shifts towards lower diffraction angle. The lattice parameter was calculated and found that it decreased from 3.62Å to 3.57Å with increase of Fe doping concentration from 0 at.% to 1 at.%. The reason behind this is the smaller ionic radius of Fe3+ (0.65Å) in comparison to that of Ce4+ (0.97Å). But from x=0.03 to x=0.05 the lattice parameter increased from 3.58Å to 3.60Å. These results indicate that Fe has substituted into CeO2 host lattice. Similar results were also observed in Cr doped CeO2 nanoparticles synthesised by microwave refluxing method [32]. The crystallite size (G) was calculated by using the Debye-Scherer formula [30], (1) G=kλ/βcos θ where, k is particle geometry dependent constant (for spherical shape k ∼1), λ is the wavelength of used (λ=1.5406Å), β is the full width-at-half maximum (FWHM) and θ is the diffraction angle, respectively. The estimated average crystallite size is found to decrease from 47nm to 30nm with increase of doping concentration from x=0.00 to x=0.05. A summary of grain size, lattice parameter, strain and dislocation density for Fe doped CeO2 nanopowders were shown in Table 1 . 3.2 Chemical composition and surface morphology The Fig. 2 (a)–(c) shows the chemical composition and the inset shows the respective surface morphology of the synthesised nanoparticles. From the figure it is confirmed that the undoped CeO2 exhibited higher crystallite size as evidenced from XRD. The crystallite size is found to decrease with increase in doping concentration as shown in Fig. 2(b). The particles are almost spherical in shape and uniformly distributed in Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles. The elements such as Ce, Fe and O were in desired ratios and no other elements were found from XRD as evidenced by XRD data. 4 Optical properties Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show the optical absorbance and reflectance spectra of pure and Fe doped CeO2 nanoparticles at different Fe doping concentrations. The optical bang gap Eg was obtained by extrapolating the linear region (α=0) of the graph plotted between (αhυ)2 versus the photon energy (hυ). The optical band gap was estimated using the Tauc equation [33] (3) αhν=A(Eg-hν)1/2 Where hν is the photon energy, α is the absorption coefficient and n is either 1/2 for a direct transition or 2 for an indirect transition. The optical band gap of semiconductor can be estimated from the intercept of the extrapolated linear fit for the plotted experimental data of (αhν)n versus incident photon energy hν near the absorption edge as shown in Fig. 3(c). An optical band gap of 3.22eV was observed for pure CeO2 nanoparticles whereas a band gap of 3.34eV was observed for Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles. The observed optical band gap is in comparable with that of band gap of bulk CeO2 powder [34]. The inconsistency in band gap was observed here. The pure CeO2 exhibited a band gap of 3.2eV whereas the band gap increased to 3.34eV, 3.36eV for Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles at x=0.01, 0.03 and it decreased to 3.32eV at x=0.05. The reason for the inconsistency in band gap of Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles is unclear here and need further study in future. This kind of inconsistent behaviour has been observed in band gap of Co doped CeO2 nanoparticles [35]. But the increase in bang gap with Fe doping concentration can be explained using Burstein-Moss band filling effect [36]. 4.1 Magnetic properties Fig. 4 (a) shows the M-H loop of the pure Fe2O3 at room temperature. From the figure it is clear that the iron oxide exhibit hysteresis loop with high coercive field. Fig. 4(b) shows the M-H loops of the undoped and Fe doped CeO2 nanoparticles obtained from the vibrating sample magnetometer on Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles at room temperature in the applied field range of+15000gauss. All the samples exhibited a clear hysteresis loop with large coercivity. In general the stoichiometric CeO2 exhibits diamagnetic nature in bulk form and can become ferromagnetic when it is prepared at nanoscale. This behaviour was predicted theoretically and observed experimental studies on CeO2 and suggested that the origin for the existence of ferromagnetism at room temperature was due to exchange interactions between Ce+3 and oxygen vacancies or BMPs bounded electrons [37,38]. If these BMPs are large in number, high magnetization will be observed due to localized coupling of Ce+3 ions with electrons magnetically. In addition to this oxygen vacancies will be present in the CeO2 host lattice and the density of these oxygen vacancies can be increased doping and/or other aspects of synthesis procedure [39]. From the figure it is clear that the undoped CeO2 nanoparticles also exhibited ferromagnetism. The magnetic moment of 4.79memu/g, coercive field of 476G and retentivityof 1.55memu/g were observed. In the recent studies it was reported that the ferromagnetism in undoped CeO2 nanoparticles was due to conversion from Ce+4 to Ce+3 ions leading to creation of oxygen vacancies. This leads to enhancement of density in Ce 4f orbital state inducing superexchange interaction between Ce ions [40]. Similar results were reported earlier for CeO2 nanoparticles by Sundaresan et al. [41] observing an RT-FM with an Ms value of approximately 1.9 memu/g and by Ge et al. [42] observing weak ferromagnetic behaviour with an Ms value of approximately 0.7 memu/g. The observed magnetic moment in the present study is better than that of reported values. Fig. 4(c) shows the field dependent magnetization of Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles x=0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 under the influence of magnetic field range of +5000Oe. The enhancement of magnetic moment on increasing the dopant concentration has been observed from the figure shown above. Remarkably, all the samples report high quality of ferromagnetism. Also the rate of increase in the enhancement of different magnetic parameters varies linearly in all Fe-doped CeO2 with concentration of Fe. Even the observed MsValues are enhanced when compared to the datas reported for pure CeO2 and transition metal doped CeO2 nanoparticles in previous reports. The Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles at x=0.01 exhibited a magnetization of 20.2 memu/g at+15000G. A magnetic moment of 80.09 memu/g was observed for Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles at x=0.05. The enhancement in the creation of oxygen vacancies, which is helpful in maintaining charge neutrality, is done by doping the host CeO2 with Fe+3 ions. As the dopant concentration is increased, the Fe+3 fractions also increased leading to enhancement of vacancy coupling pairs/Ce+3ions. This as whole results in the enhancement of MS in the Ce1-xFexO2 nanoparticles. For doped CeO2 nanomaterials, the development of excess of oxygen vacancies leads to exhibition of ferromagnetism at room temperature. The enhancement in the creation of oxygen vacancies is occurring due to doping in CeO2 host lattice by Fe3+ ions. It has been suggested that Fe3+–V0–Ce3+ interaction is predominant at lower Fe doping concentration, while the Fe3+–V0–Fe3+ are predominant when Fe doping concentration is increased to a maximum level. However, the increase in the Fe concentration increases the creation of oxygen vacancies. This plays a significant role in the increase of the MS values as no signature of secondary phases were observed here. A summary of saturation magnetization, coercivity and retentivity for Fe doped CeO2 nanopowders were shown in Table 2 . 5 Conclusions Pure and Fe doped CeO2 nanoparticles were prepared by using ball milling method and different characterization techniques were used to have an overview about their structural, optical and magnetic properties. Cubic structure was observed for both undoped and Fe doped CeO2 nanoparticles. High magnetization with high coercive fields was observed for Fe doped CeO2 nanoparticle. The magnetic moment is found to increase along with Fe doping concentration suggesting that increase in doping concentration increases the number of oxygen vacancies. The observed magnetization is intrinsic in nature as no other phases related to impurities were identified.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.091,Fabrication and characterization of rutile-phased titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods array with various reaction times using one step hydrothermal method,"Abstract Rutile titanium dioxide nanorods array were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide by using hydrothermal method. The influences of hydrothermal reaction time on morphology, structure property, crystallization, and Raman spectra have been investigated. The hydrothermal treatment was conducted by varying the reaction time at 4, 10, 16, and 24h with temperature of 150°C. The nanostructure samples were analyzed using field emission-scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The resulting nanorods array shows increasing diameter as the reaction time increased. Meanwhile, the growth of the nanorods stop at one point as can be seen in its thickness, x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectra. This behavior can be attributed to hydrolysis rate of the precursor titanium butoxide (TBOT) as the reaction time increased.",Feb-18," Keywords TiO2 Nanorods array One-step hydrothermal method Raman 1 Introduction Titanium dioxide (TiO2) exists in three known crystalline that is anatase, rutile, and brookite with polymorphs tetragonal for both anatase and rutile, and orthorhombic for brookite [1]. TiO2 have received significant notice these past few decades after the discoveries of photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) and dye sensitized solar cell [2,3]. Major drawbacks of TiO2 nanoparticles related to its recombination process during cell performance [4]. To overcome the drawback, TiO2 nanostructures such as nanorods, nanoflowers, and nanowires were introduced, as its exhibit excellent electron transport due to its well-defined crystalline structure and unique optical properties, which minimizes the recombination process and have been considered as a substitute in the solar cells and electronic devices [5–11]. As TiO2 nanostructures exhibit high crystallinity properties, the electron mobility is also high, thus indirectly enhanced the electron transport and minimize the recombination losses in the thin film [12–14]. There are several methods to produces these nanostructures such as sol-gel, chemical bath deposition (CBD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and hydrothermal method. In this study, TiO2 was fabricated by using hydrothermal method. Other methods were at disadvantages such as CBD and CVD methods that usually use an elevated temperature around 300–400°C, while for sol-gel, there is often a cracking and large volume shrinkage during drying process [15–19]. Hydrothermal synthesis method uses a low temperature for mass production of well aligned TiO2 nanostructures directly on substrates, which in this study are using a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. By using FTO, the preparation for seed layer can be eliminated. In this study, the thin film TiO2 fabricated were in rutile-phase. Highly crystalline TiO2 were intensively investigated due to its advantages such as easily controllable diameter and thickness [20], as well as high electron mobility and chemical stability [21,22] compared to anatase and brookite. These features make it suitable for applications such as photocatalyst and ultraviolet photodetector [23,24]. 2 Experimental Titanium dioxide nanorods array were synthesized using the hydrothermal process in a chemical solution. 120mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was dissolved in 120mL of deionized (DI) water. After vigorously stirred for 5min, 3.5mL of titanium butoxide (TBOT) was added dropwise using capillary tube. After that, the solution was poured into the autoclave with Teflon-made liner for hydrothermal process to begin. Hydrothermal reaction takes place at 150°C with reaction times of 4, 10, 16 and 24h. After that, the autoclave was taken out from the oven and was let to cool to room temperature. The sampe was then rinsed with DI water and left to dry in oven with 60°C for 10min. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) JEOL JSM-7600F model operated at 15kV was used to characterize the morphology and thickness of the samples. Meanwhile, the crystal structure and crystallite size are defined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) PANalytical X-Pert3 Powder model. The scan axis used was 2h with range of 20θ − 60θ and the type of slit used were fixed divergence slit. Finally, Raman spectra were obtained using a Micro-Raman Spectroscope (Renishaw InVia microRaman System) operated with 514nm wavelength of argon (Ar+) laser. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Field-emission scanning electron microscopy Fig. 1 shows the FESEM image of the nanorods array grown on top of the FTO layer at different reaction times ranging from 4h to 24h. Fig. 1(a)–(d) showed the surface of the nanorods with reaction times of 4h, 10h, 16h, and 24h, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the nanorods grew in decent shape after the reaction time of 16h. Fig. 1(a) shows that the nanorods can barely be seen as the reaction time was too short for growth of the nanorods with diameter produced ranging from 30 to 45nm. The rods are in slanting position with large gaps between each other. However, the nanorods started to grow with increasing reaction time, as can be observed in Fig. 1(b) and (c), with size ranges from 250 to 450nm and 250–300nm, respectively. It can be seen on the surface structure of Fig. 1(b) that the nanorods started to develop in tetragonal shape and a gap between the nanorods has started to form. Meanwhile, from Fig. 1(c), it can be seen that the TiO2 nanorods have grown in decent tetragonal shape with a flat-end facets and obvious gap between them. As the reaction time further increase, the nanorods agglomerate to each other, thus eliminating the gap between the nanorods and the rods also lose their tetragonal forms resulting diameter ranges from 200 to 450nm as shown in Fig. 1(d). A cross-sectional image of the synthesized TiO2 nanorods array is shown in Fig. 1(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) for 4, 10, 16, and 24h reaction time, respectively. For Fig. 1(i), the cross sectional image shows only of FTO substrate as the nanorods were too small and almost invisible as can be seen in Fig. 1(a). Overall image shows that the nanorods grew perpendicular to the substrate with length of the nanorods to be 0.79μm for Fig. 1(ii), 1.61μm for Fig. 1(iii), and 2.73 for Fig. 1(iv). It can be concluded that the lengths of TiO2 nanorods increase with increasing reaction time [1]. 3.2 X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of the nanorods TiO2 prepared with different reaction times are shown in Fig. 2 (a)–(d) for 4h, 10h, 16h and 24h, respectively. Clear diffraction peaks are recorded between 20° and 60° consisting of rutile TiO2 and FTO peaks. The rutile peaks are indexed to (101), (200), and (111) planes of TiO2 with tetragonal structures. Fig. 2(a) shows dominant peaks of FTO at 26°, 34°, 37°, 51°, 55° and a rutile TiO2 peak at 39° of plane (200). This is confirmed with FESEM image which shows mostly FTO surface and nanorods only starting to grow on it. XRD diffraction for nanorods prepared in 10 and 16h reaction times as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively, were a mixed of FTO and rutile peaks. Both samples prepared have two rutile peaks correspond to planes (101) and (111) with insignificant change in their intensity. In the meantime, intensity for FTO peaks have decreased due to the thickness of the thin film that increased with increasing time as stated in FESEM analysis. In Fig. 2(d), it can be seen that there is no FTO peaks produced leaving only rutile TiO2 peaks as the diffraction with a slight drop in its intensity. Fig. 2 shows that the (101) plane orientation peak centred at 36° gave the highest intensity for rutile TiO2 compared to the others. This indicates that the nanorods growth occurred preferentially vertically to the FTO substrate. Overall peaks observed gave either a strong, sharp diffraction, or a weak, sharp diffraction. There is no broad peak produced thus showing good crystallinity of the samples. During the growth of TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrates, the SnO2 act as a nucleation layer. In order to reduce the surface energy by terminating high energy facets, attachment always takes place at the high energy surfaces. As both rutile and SnO2 have tetragonal structure where the surface energy of (101) plane is high, growth of titania crystal occurs instantly. While the thermodynamically stable crystal structure of SnO2 is rutile, the very small lattice mismatch of both TiO2 and FTO substrate were the driving force for the epitaxial growth of TiO2 nanorod arrays [25]. Table 1 shows the obtained crystallite size for each sample. Different reaction times gave quite a significant change in the crystallite size, except for 16 and 24h reaction time where the crystallite sizes are the same. The crystallite size increases when time increases as increasing time allowing greater coalescence of the particles [26,27]. 3.3 Raman spectroscopy Raman spectra of TiO2 nanorods with different reaction times are shown in Fig. 3 (a)–(d) for 24h, 16h, 10h and 4h, respectively. Peak position produced for Fig. 3(a) are normalized as shown in Fig. 4 , which shows only the peaks of FTO at 570cm−1 and 1087cm−1. Starting from Fig. 3(b) to (c), all peaks produced are of rutile TiO2 Raman shifts at 122cm−1, 241cm−1, 441cm−1, and 620cm−1 which confirmed the result of XRD peaks. Three of the peaks, 122cm−1, 441cm−1, and 620cm−1 are the dominant peaks of rutile single crystal expressed as A1g +B1g +Eg. There is also a second-order scattering peak at 241cm−1 which is also a characteristic of rutile TiO2. The weak and broad peak produced at 241cm−1 was likely because of phonon confinement effect [1]. The samples show increasing intensity of the Raman peaks with increasing reaction time at its prominent maxima which are at 441cm−1 and 620cm−1. This indicated that the nanorods prepared with longer reaction time have better crystallinity as had been in agreement with XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2. This result also suggests that thickness of the sample increase with increasing reaction time. 4 Conclusions Titanium dioxide thin films have been successfully fabricated on top fluorine-doped tin oxide by using hydrothermal method. The reaction time was varied from 4 to 24h. FESEM image of the resulting thin films shows that the diameter of the nanorods increased with increasing reaction time, and the crystalline structure shows rutile phase in all sample fabricated according to XRD pattern and Raman spectra.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.09.110,Research on characterization and modeling for ultraviolet degradation of imidacloprid based on absorbance change,"Abstract Absorption spectrum of imidacloprid was measured using spectrophotometer and the most intensive characteristic peak (269nm) was found. The function relationship between imidacloprid concentration and absorbance was obtained with a good linear relationship(R >0.99). The hardware platform for pesticide degradation was designed and built based on ultraviolet light technology, and imidacloprid degradation experiments were conducted based on the platform. It was proposed to describe degradation effect using absorbance change, and prediction model of pesticide residues degradation was obtained according to the relationship between degradation time and absorbance. The results showed that it was feasible to characterize ultraviolet degradation effect according to absorbance change, degradation rate was 4.71% after ultraviolet irradiation for 1minute, and it was 98.43% after 10minutes.",Feb-18," Keywords Ultraviolet light Absorbance Pesticide degradation Imidacloprid 1 Introduction Imidacloprid is a kind of insecticide, which is widely used in agricultural production [1,2]. Pesticide residues will bring potential risk to consumers, and the research methods of pesticide residues have been reported in the literature. For example, P. Karthik conducted a study on imidacloprid residue dynamics in okra under open field conditions [3], Huanan Guan carried out experimental study on dynamics and degradation method of imidacloprid residues in soyabean fields [4], Ji Rendong studied fluorescence spectral method to detect the Imidacloprid residues of apple juice [5], Bahareh Jamshidi implemented the detection of pesticide residues in agricultural product based on Vis/NIR spectroscopic technology [6]. On the other hand, the degradation of pesticide residues is also an important research field. At present, the main degradation technology includes physical method, chemical method and biological method. The physical method mainly contains ultrasonic wave and ionization irradiation [7–9]. Chemical method is one of the most studied degradation technologies, which includes photochemical degradation, chemical oxidation, photocatalysis method and so on [10–12]. Microorganism including bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes are used to degrade pesticide residues in biological method [13,14]. The principle of ultraviolet irradiation degradation of pesticide residues is consistent with the photochemical degradation [15], ultraviolet irradiation can break the double bond of pesticide and destroy the combination of organic carbon that constitute the pesticide, and then, organic matter will be decomposed into small molecular substances. The degradation of imidacloprid residue using ultraviolet light was proposed in this paper, degradation effect was characterized through the change of absorbance, and the relationship between degradation time and degradation rate was derived at last. Research results have some reference value on the selection of detection and degradation technology of pesticide residues. 2 Experiments 2.1 Materials Imidacloprid purchased from Shanghai pesticide research institute (Shanghai, China) was selected as experiment sample. 2.2 Experimental apparatus UV3600 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was used to measure the absorption spectrum of imidacloprid pesticide sample. The equipment structure of ultraviolet irradiation degradation was shown in Fig. 1 , which contained 6 parts. The numerical label 1 represented closed system, 2 represented switching device of closed system, 3 was ultraviolet light source module, 4 was module support, 5 was sample pool and 6 was the time control switch of power supply, which can control the irradiation time of ultraviolet irradiation. Low-voltage and high intensity ultraviolet lamp of quartz type was selected as the ultraviolet light source, and its light transmittance was greater than 90%. The lamp was controlled by a electronic ballast with variable power output, the emission wavelength was set to be 253.7nm, the power was set as 3W, the tube voltage was 9.5∼13V, and the pipe flow was 300mA. Ultraviolet lamp was connected to 220V alternating current through a capacitor (4.7F/400V), and ultraviolet irradiation time was controlled by the time control switch. The closed system also contained a cavity and a bracket to place the sample pool. 2.3 Procedures First, a right amount of imidacloprid pesticide was measured using electronic balance which was then configured as standard pesticide solution of different concentrations, and the solution with different concentrations was placed in the cuvette and its absorption spectrum was detected by using UV3600, respectively. And then, 3ml imidacloprid solution was placed in the sample pool of ultraviolet degradation device using cuvette, the absorption spectrum of pesticide was recorded by using UV3600 after the solution was irradiated under ultraviolet light for different time. And the relationship between illumination time and characteristic peak absorbance of the pesticide was deduced at last. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 The absorption spectrum of imidacloprid The absorption spectrum of imidacloprid solution detected by UV3600 was shown in Fig. 2 , and it showed that the spectrum range was from 220nm to 700nm. In Fig. 2, four curves represented corresponding absorbance spectrum of four different concentrations of imidacloprid solution, and the solution concentration was 0.072mg/ml, 0.036mg/ml, 0.018mg/ml and 0.009mg/ml from curve 1 to curve 4, respectively. There was a strong absorption peak at 269nm, and the peak was reduced from 5.2 to 0.9 with the decrease of solution concentration. Therefore, 269nm can be used as the characteristic peak of imidacloprid absorption spectrum. This molecular absorption spectrum was generated by the electronic transition between valence electron and electron in molecular orbital, which belonged to n→π* transition, from nonbonding atomic orbital to molecular antibonding orbital with high level [16]. To analyze the relationship between imidacloprid solution concentration and absorbance, unitary linearity regression method was applied. The results were shown in Fig. 3 , it was found that the relationship between imidacloprid concentration and absorbance was linear when wavelength was at 269nm, the correlation coefficient is 0.9961, and the function of concentration prediction was derived as bellow: (1) y = 67.6095 x + 0.2258 3.2 Imidacloprid degradation using ultraviolet Imidacloprid solution(0.0255mg/ml)was degraded using ultraviolet irradiation for different time, absorption spectrum was detected using UV3600 after each degradation, the absorption spectrum results were shown in Fig. 4 , in which, the spectrum range was from 220nm to 360nm. The degradation time of imidacloprid solution was set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20minutes from curve 1 to curve 8, separately. It was obvious that there was a strong absorption peak at 269nm for all the eight absorption spectrum curves. And with the increase of degradation time, the peak value was correspondingly reduced from 1.95 to 0.26, but the peak position remained stable, which further indicated that 269nm was the characteristic peak of imidacloprid absorption spectrum. For further analysis of imidacloprid degradation trend, regression modeling method was applied between ultraviolet irradiation time and absorbance at 269nm. The results were shown in Fig. 5 , the correlation coefficient of polynomial model function was 0.9964, and the function equation was: (2) Y =1.9726−0.0944x −0.0053x 2 +0.0003x 3 The equivalent concentration of imidacloprid solution after degradation was obtained according to Eq. (1), and the degradation rate could be calculated further based on the imidacloprid concentration before and after degradation. The degradation rate was calculated according to Eq. (3): (3) D = ( C 0 − C t ) C 0 × 100 % where D represented degradation rate, C0 represented initial concentration of imidacloprid solution, and Ct represented concentration after degradation using ultraviolet irradiation for time t. The calculation results were shown in Table 1 , it showed that imidacloprid concentration was decreased from 0.0255mg/ml to 0.0243mg/ml after ultraviolet irradiation for 1minute, and the corresponding degradation rate was 4.71%, this meant ultraviolet irradiation had some effect on degradation, but the effect is not very well. When ultraviolet irradiation time was increased to 10minutes, the degradation effect is obvious with the degradation rate up to 72.16%, when ultraviolet irradiation time was set to 20minutes, imidacloprid concentration was decreased to 0.0004mg/ml and the degradation rate reached up to 98.43%, this indicated that imidacloprid was almost completely degraded. 4 Conclusions Absorbance spectrum of imidacloprid solution with different concentration was detected using UV3600 in this paper, and analysis results showed that 269nm was its characteristic peak. Unitary linearity regression method was applied between concentration of imidacloprid solution and absorbance at 269nm, and the function equation of imidacloprid concentration prediction model was deduced with correlation coefficient of 0.9961. The platform for pesticides degradation with ultraviolet irradiation was designed, and imidacloprid degradation experiment was conducted based on the platform. The degradation process was characterized by the change of absorbance, and degradation model function and degradation rate were obtained at last. The results showed that the characteristic peak absorbance was decreased with the degradation time increasing, and the degradation rate was increased accordingly. When the degradation time was set to 20minutes, the degradation rate can reach up to 98.43%. This showed that pesticides degradation can be realized by using ultraviolet irradiation and this provided a reference value for the selection of pesticide degradation technology.

10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.10.039,Observation of high photocatalytic activity by tuning of defects in chemically synthesized ethylene glycol capped ZnO nanorods,"Abstract In this work, we have reported the tuning of defects by simple thermal annealing of as-synthesized ethylene glycol capped ZnO nanorods at 200–600°C temperatures. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data has confirmed the formation of Wurtzite structure of ZnO and the presence of a small amount of tensile strain is confirmed by Williamson – Hall analyses of XRD data. The lattice strain is found to increase with increasing temperature up-to 400°C and on further increase in temperature it is decreased. To study the influence of defects on photo-catalytic properties of the samples, the degradation of a test dye, namely Methylene Blue (MB) under UV–vis light irradiation has been carried out and the reaction kinetics has been determined by Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. It has been found that 400°C annealed sample exhibits the highest photo-catalytic dye degradation efficiency of ∼83%, within only 20min. The effect of initial MB dye loading on photo-catalytic efficiency of 400°C annealed sample has also been tested and reported an optimum value of dye concentration. The successful introduction of defect states in 400°C annealed sample, as confirmed by PL measurement, has played an important role to achieve the high photo-catalytic activity in the samples.",Feb-18," Keywords Optical properties Photo-catalytic Photoluminescence ZnO Defect tuning Thermal annealing Chemical synthesis Nanorod 1 Introduction The uses of hazardous dyes in textile industry have been a ubiquitous problem of human civilization and efforts are required to counter its effect on environment. The use of semiconductor photo-catalyst for the degradation of dye molecules dissolved in water is an age-old technique [1–3]. When a photo-catalyst is illuminated with the light of appropriate wavelength, electron–hole pairs diffuse out to the surface of the photocatalyst and participate in the photochemical reaction. Those free electrons and holes transform the surrounding oxygen or water molecules into OH radicals having strong oxidizing ability. These radicals are responsible for the effective decomposition of harmful organic dyes into its less hazardous simpler forms. Among different kinds of semiconductors and its composites nanomaterial of TiO2, ZnO, ZnS, CdS, WO3 etc. have been considered extensively due to their useful properties [3,4]. TiO2 is the most commonly used effective photo-catalyst. However, recently it has been found that ZnO with a wide band gap of ∼3.2eV is a good and an alternative semiconductor material for its high efficiency, photochemical stability, non-toxic nature and low cost preparation technique [5]. It has been reported earlier that due to lower exciton recombination rate and greater surface area ZnO has showed promise to achieve a high photo-catalytic efficiency [6]. Several researchers in the past have also reported the benefits of using a smaller sized nanostructure with various microstructures for the degradation of organic dyes [7–9]. They have demonstrated that a larger surface to volume ratio and use of some specific shapes of ZnO elevates the rate and efficiency of dye adsorption at active sites and thus dye degradation rate is improved [7]. Different methods have been tried by earlier researchers to enhance the photocatalytic activity of ZnO by tailoring its size, facets, and surface area [7–9]. Recently, Jang et al. have reported the relationship between the crystal growth plane of ZnO nanocrystals and their photocatalytic efficiency [8]. They have found that the availability of greater proportion of polar surfaces (001) led to a greater photocatalytic activity [8]. They reported that OH ions prefer to adsorb onto polar (001)-Zn surface due to its positive charge, which can react with hole (h+ ) to generate OH radicals and thus enhances the photo-catalytic activity of the sample. The e−/h+ pair is the key factor in determining the photocatalytic reaction rate. Amongst other techniques, thermal annealing is a simple technique as it may effect on the electron-hole recombination rate in ZnO nanostructure and thus photocatalytic dye degradation efficiency of the photo-catalyst may be tailored [8–12]. The effect of annealing and aspect ratio of ZnO and TiO2 nanostructures on photo-degradation of MB dye has been dealt with previously by several researchers [8–12]. Lv et al. reported that ZnO shows 88% degradation of dye in 180min due to annealing at 800°C [11] as compared to 73% for annealed sample at 400°C. Yu et al. has reported that TiO2 shows good photo-catalytic activity at 700°C [9] compared to room temperature sample. In all above reports we have observed that the annealing temperature is quite high to obtain a reasonable photo-catalytic performance. Besides the aspect ratio, shape and size, the presences of surface defects on ZnO are another very important factor for prompting its photo-catalytic performance. In fact, the defects on ZnO have been extensively characterized by various techniques, and their roles in adsorption and surface reactivity have been considered and shows that different oxygen defects (oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen) and zinc defects (zinc interstitial) that formed in a solvothermal process has an impact on the photo-catalytic activity of ZnO [10]. Zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancy both play very important roles in photo-catalytic activity [10]. However, in this work we have reported the synthesis of ZnO nanorod by solvothermal technique and then we have demonstrated the tuning of surface defects by simple thermal annealing the as-synthesized sample at 200°, 400° and 600°C temperatures and we could achieve high photo-catalytic degradation efficiency. FESEM, TEM and XRD techniques have been used to obtain the microstructure and phase of the samples. Optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopies have been used to confirm the band gap and the presence of defects in the samples. Photo-catalytic property of all the samples have been investigated and found that the sample which has been annealed at 400°C showing the highest MB dye degradation efficiency of 83%. The Langmuir−Hinshelwood (L-H) model has been used to evaluate the kinetics of dye degradation. The optimized degradation efficiency for different dye concentration has been evaluated and is found to be highest for MB-dye of concentration 20mg/L. The effect of particle shape and defect states on kinetics of photo-catalytic degradation has been investigated. A generalized mechanism of chemical reaction of MB dye on photocatalysis has also been reported in this work. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of samples We have synthesized the ZnO nanorods with varying aspect ratio in two steps. At first ZnO nanoparticles have been freshly synthesized by solvothermal route and then the as-synthesized samples have been isochronally annealed for 2h at various temperatures within the temperature range of 200–600°C. For the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticle by solvothermal technique, 0.016M of Zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn (CH3COO)2] 2H2O is dissolved in 40ml of EG under vigorous stirring for 90min. Then the solution is transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave maintained at 160°C for 8h. Then the autoclave is left for cooling at room temperature and the precipitate is collected by centrifugation and washed several times with DI water. The precipitate is then dried in our laboratory oven at 100°C for 2h to obtain the final ZnO powder. The obtained sample is divided into four parts, one part is annealed in air ambient at 200°C denoted hereby as S#200, another part at 400°C denoted as S#400, another at 600°C denoted as S#600 and the fourth part is as-synthesized sample denoted as S#RT. All the samples are further characterized for determining their nanostructures and measurement of their optical properties. 2.2 Characterization The XRD patterns have been recorded using a PAN Analytical X-Pert Pro Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation in the scan range 20–65°. The formations of ZnO nanorod have been confirmed by using TEM and FESEM. TEM images have been recorded in a TEM (JEOL JEM 2100) after dispersing the samples in a carbon coated copper grid. FESEM (ZEISS SIGMA) has been used for structural analysis. The optical absorption spectra of all the samples have been recorded after dispersion in de ionized (DI) water using an UV–vis spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-3010). The PL spectra have been measured at RT by using a PL spectrofluorometer (Perkin Elmer LS 55) by keeping them in a four side polished cuvette of path length 1cm. 2.3 Photo-catalytic dye degradation experiments Photo-catalytic activity of the samples are investigated by observing photo degradation of aqueous solutions of a test dye, namely MB dyes, in the presence of the samples kept inside a cylindrical photo chemical reactor (M/S Lelesil Systems, India). The solution is magnetically stirred for 40min to attain the adsorption equilibrium and then it is irradiated by a 125W UV–vis lamp. Equal amounts of the solution have been collected after each 5min interval and the photo-catalytic degradation of MB solution is monitored by analyzing the UV–vis absorption spectra of the collected solution. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural analysis XRD pattern of all samples have been collected to find out the effect of annealing temperature on the synthesized samples. The XRD pattern of S#RT, S#200, S#400 and S#600 samples are shown in Fig. 1 . From Fig. 1(a) it has been found that all samples are consisting of hexagonal wurtzite (WZ) phase of ZnO and all XRD peaks are well matched with standard JCPDS data (Card no: 00–001–1136). The value of lattice parameters (a, b and c) of the hexagonal ZnO has been calculated using Eq. (1) [13]. (1) 1 d 2 = 4 3 ( h 2 + h k + k 2 ) a 2 + l 2 c 2 . Where, a and c are the lattice constants. The calculated values of lattice parameter are summarized in Table 1 . It has been observed that with increasing annealing temperature, the values of the lattice parameter are increased with increasing annealing temperature up-to 400°C, indicating the presence of tensile strain in our samples. Further increase in annealing temperature up-to 600°C shows the reduction in tensile strain in the sample. This strain may be originated from the displacements of the unit cells, dislocation, lattice vacancies, surface restricting, interstitials, doping etc. [13–16]. UV–vis absorption spectra of the RT and annealed samples have been depicted in Fig. 1(c). It has been observed that the absorption spectra of RT sample has a well-defined excitonic peak at∼372nm (∼3.33eV) and the excitonic peak of the annealed samples are red shifted and S#600 sample shows a detectable shift of 8nm in compared with that of RT sample. Also it has been observed that the value of band gap energy of annealed samples has decreased from 3.33eV (for S#RT) to 3.26eV (for S#600) with increasing the temperature and this may be due to the change in defects concentration, particle size, morphology and broken surface layer bonds [17,18]. Zak et al. [17] have reported that the band gap energy has decreased with increasing the annealing temperature and this may be due to the increase in particle size. Recently, Ma et al. [18] have theoretically investigated the effect of annealing condition on the band gap of ZnO crystallites and also provided the experimental verification of it. They have [18] reported that thermal and the cohesive energy of the under coordinated atoms in the surface skin of ZnO induce local strain and quantum entrapment due to annealing which in turn perturb the Hamiltonian. And as a result of that the change in band gap takes place due to annealing. The tensile lattice strain is defined as the ratio of the incremental change of the lattice parameter to its initial value as a result d-spacing of the crystallographic planes also changes. According to Bragg’s law, the Bragg angles should either decrease or increase when d-spacing of the crystallographic lattice plane is changed. For uniform tensile strain the position of the Bragg’s peak shifts to a lower diffraction angle (θ) with the increasing lattice parameter [15]. Since, the lower angle shifts observed in all of our samples with increasing the annealing temperature up-to 400°C which is shown in Fig. 1(b), we believe that a uniform tensile strain has been developed in the perpendicular direction to the lattice plane. To investigate the tensile strain developed in our samples during annealing we have used Williamson-Hall (W-H) plot and uniform deformation model (UDM) which are shown in Fig. 2 (a–d). In the W-H method, it has been suggested that the observed XRD line broadening is due to crystallite size and strain contribution and it can be written as [13], (2) β = β t + β ε . Where, βt is crystallite size broadening, βε is strain induced broadening and β is the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of instrumental corrected broadening. Strain induced broadening generally arises due to crystal imperfection and distortion which is given by the following relation [13], (3) β ε = 4 tan θ . By considering both of these broadenings, as discussed above, we can rewrite Eq. (3) as, (4) β = k λ D cos θ + 4 ε tan θ . Or, (5) β cos θ = k λ D + 4 ε sin θ . Eqs. (4) and (5) represent the W-H UDM in which the isotropic nature of the crystal is assumed [15]. The slopes of the graphs give the values of strain (ε) and the intercept gives the particle size (D). The positive values of the slope for all samples indicate the tensile strain and it has been attributed due to lattice vacancies, interstitials etc. [14]. The magnitude of the strain is almost two times in case of 400°C annealed sample than that of RT sample and for better viewing the values of strain for all samples has been shown in Table 1. 3.2 FESEM and TEM analyses FESEM and TEM investigations have been carried out to investigate the changes in shape and size of the samples after thermal annealing at different temperatures. The FESEM images of all samples are shown in Fig. 3 (a–d). Fig. 3(a) shows FESEM image of S#RT sample which is clearly showing the presence of nanorod like morphologies along-with some near spherical shapes at RT. Fig. 3(b–d) show the FESEM images of all annealed samples. The TEM images of S#200, S#400 and S#600 samples have been shown in Fig. 4 (e–h) which revealed that the aspect ratio (major axis/minor axis) of the nanorods has been reduced and there is a gradual shift in the particle morphology from nanorod like to spherical has been occurred with the increase in annealing temperature. From the TEM images we have observed that aspect ratio of the synthesized nanorods has decreased with the increase in annealing temperature up-to 400°C and then it has increased as we further increase the temperature to 600°C. As can be seen from Fig. 4(e), the average length and diameter of the nanorods in as-synthesized samples have been calculated by fitted with log normal distribution and get∼120nm and ∼ 35–45nm, respectively. When the temperature is increased to 200°C, as can be seen from Fig. 4(f), the diameter of the nanorods has increased to ∼48nm but the length has reduced. Therefore, it is found that as the annealing temperature is increased, the particle morphology tend to change from rod to near spherical in shape. From the above TEM investigations it is clear that the annealing temperature is playing an important role in the synthesis of ZnO nanorods with various morphologies. From the SEM images of S#400, shown in Fig. 3(c), it can be seen clearly that the particles shapes are spherical in nature with the diameter of ∼51nm, as a results of annealing. After increasing the annealing temperature to 600°C, a significant change in shape and diameter size (∼100nm) are observed, as shown in Fig. 3(d) and Fig. 3(h). The FESEM image of S#600 samples shows the presence of well-defined crystalline planes of ZnO nanocrystals. Due to the high annealing temperature, tensile strain has been released and thus the crystallinity has been improved, this has also been confirmed earlier from W-H analyses. 3.3 Formation mechanism In this section we shall discuss about the mechanism of formations of ZnO nanorods with various morphologies. We have used the EG as the liquid media during solvothermal process. Here, nanorod shaped ZnO has been formed through a homogeneous nucleation and growth process [19–21]. When zinc acetate dehydrate react with EG at RT, zinc glycolate (Zn(OCH2 CH2 O)) capped ZnO nanorods has been formed as an intermediate product [21] and which are confirmed from TEM images. This layer is transformed into ZnO due to increasing the annealing according to the following endothermic reaction which has given below, (6) Z n ( − O − C H 2 − C H 2 − O − ) → Annealing Z n O . Here, EG acts as a modifying agent and the modification occur through nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN) between EG and zinc glycolate. Hydrolysis is another crucial factor which controls the shape and size of ZnO nanoparticles during nucleation process [22]. The presence of thin layer of EG at the surface of as-synthesized ZnO nanorods is clearly visible in the TEM images shown in Fig. 4(e). The boiling point of EG is ∼198°C [19], so when we annealed the samples at 200°C–400°C temperature, EG will come out and the effective particle diameter is enhanced. Also as we increased the annealing temperature tensile strain is developed on (100) and (010) crystallographic planes of nanorods of ZnO. The developed tensile strain plays a key role in the transformation of ZnO nanorods present in as synthesized sample to spherical and nearly spherical shape in annealed sample as observed earlier in our TEM study. After that when we increased the annealing temperature up to 600°C, the agglomeration [23] of small particle has been occurred, which is hindered previously due to the presence of EG layer on ZnO nanostructure in RT. 3.4 Optical properties The photo-catalytic degradation activity of semiconductor nanoparticles can be understood by careful investigations on its linear optical properties. In principle ZnO has number of defect states within the band gap, and the presence of such defect energy states can be easily recognised by simple measurements of PL emission characteristics of the sample [24–27]. The role of defects in determination of photo-catalytic efficiency of nanomaterial has been studied earlier [10]. The donor type and acceptor type defect states present in ZnO are zinc interstitials (Zni ++, Zni + and Zn i x) and oxygen vacancy (Vo ++, Vo + and Vo x) and zinc interstitial and oxygen vacancy are known to be the predominant ionic defects [28]. Zinc interstitial defects come from the Frenkel reaction and then ionized to form Zni ++, Zni +, Zn i x. Oxygen vacancies are also get ionized, the formation mechanism of such defect states are given below; (7) Z n Z n ↔ Z n i x + V Z n x . (7.a) Z n i x ↔ Z n i + + e − . (7.b) Z n i + ↔ Z n i + + + e − . (7.c) V 0 x ↔ V 0 + + e − . (7.d) V 0 + + ↔ V 0 + + h + . Zinc interstitial defects have been regarded as one of the origin of blue emission in ZnO nanoparticles and Zni related blue emission has also been observed by Zeng et al. [24]. The extended Zni defects can be formed according the defect ionization reaction (Eqs. 7a and b). Another set of major defects has been observed in ZnO nanoparticles which are oxygen vacancy states. Among all these defects, some defects are more sensitive to temperature and can only survive at low temperatures. Recently, Vlasenko et al. has shown experimentally that Zni are very unstable and decreases rapidly with increasing the annealing temperature beyond 400°C [26]. These Zni defects are responsible for effective capturing of the e-h pair which induces a delay in e-h pair recombination, which is also evident from the observation of highest photo-catalytic activity of our S#400 sample and decrease in photo-catalytic activity in S #600 samples, which are presented later. In order to find out the collective information about the different defect states and vacancies present in the sample, PL emission spectra of all samples have been collected and those are shown in Fig. 4, measured at an excitation wavelength of 325nm. To find out exact peak position of PL emission spectra of S#RT sample it has been de-convoluted by Gaussian fitting function and it has been shown in Fig. 4(a). The presence of strong near band edge (NBE) emission peak at 386nm (∼3.22eV) and the deep level emission (DLE) peaks at 423nm (∼2.93eV), 451nm (∼2.75eV), 477nm (∼2.60eV), 485nm (∼2.56eV) and 523nm (∼2.37eV) are evident from Fig. 4(a) and which are denoted by numerical numbers (1–6). The NBE peak at 386nm has been assigned to free excitonic recombination in the sample. The peak appeared in the blue region, i.e. at 423nm is assigned to the transition from Zn i to valence band and the series of blue emission peaks are attributed to the transition from extended Zn i states to the valence band [24,27]. These extended Zni states can be formed during the annealing of the sample up to the temperature of 400°C and decreases beyond 400°C, this type of defects formation have been described earlier by Xu et al. [28]. Fig. 4(b) shows the PL emission spectra of S#RT, S#200, S#400 and S#600 samples. From Fig. 4(b) the red shift of NBE PL peak has occurred in the sample annealed at 400°C, this has perhaps aroused due to increase in particle size with increase in annealing temperature [29]. In the S#400 sample, PL emission intensity is found to be enhanced in comparison to that of the RT sample and other annealed samples which can be explained in terms of the energy level diagram given in the inset of Fig. 4(b). The dependence of DLE (485nm) with different excitation wavelength are depicted in Fig. 4 (c) and it is observed that the increase in PL emission intensity occurs with increase in annealing temperature up to 400°C and then it is decreased at higher annealing temperature. From these results it can be concluded that low annealing temperature supply the sufficient ionization energy and generates more amount of Zni defects [24], but at higher annealing temperature DLE intensity is reduced due to outward diffusion of Zni [24,30]. Therefore, the defect states in ZnO nanostructures can be tuned by simple adjustment of the annealing temperature and induce a large amount of defects in the ZnO structures which is responsible for high photo-catalytic degradation activity, as presented in the next section. 3.5 Photo-catalytic dye degradation The photo-catalytic dye degradation efficiencies of the samples have been evaluated by UV–vis light driven photo-catalytic degradation of MB dye solution. The value of large specific surface area coupled with high visible PL emissions from the samples produced after thermal annealing motivate us to optimize the photo-catalytic activity of the annealed and RT samples. According to the researchers, the photo-catalytic performance of a photo-catalyst depends on its morphology, specific surface area, presence of open polar surfaces and defect sites [31–36]. The presence of a large amount of oxygen vacancies in the sample can also increase the number of active sites and stimulate the e-h separation activity. It has been reported earlier that the photo-catalytic activities of ZnO nanorods and nanoflowers are very high due to their large surface area, composites with metal nanoparticle and defects [33]. ZnO nanodisks are also shown to have very high photo-catalytic degradation efficiency [34]. The UV–vis absorbance spectra of MB dye in presence of S#RT, S#200, S#400 and S#600 samples with irradiation time are shown in Fig. 5 (a). From the plots, the absorbance maxima of MB dye has been found at 664nm and the absorption intensity is found to decreases with increasing time for all samples but with different rate of decay. From Fig. 5(a), it is found that S#400 sample shows the high photocatalytic degradation activity because of the presence of a large amount of defect states, which has also been confirmed by the PL emission and XRD data analyses. To investigate the reaction kinetics of the MB dye degradation in the presence of the samples, we have fitted the experimental data using a simple L-H kinetic model and calculated the degradation efficiency which are given below [37,38], (8) D y e deg r a d a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y ( η ) = A 0 − A A o × 100. (9) ln ( C 0 C ) = ln ( A 0 A ) = k t . Where, C and C0 are the concentration and A and A0 are the absorbance at any time t and at the starting time t =0, respectively and k is the reaction rate constant. The fitted curves along-with the experimental data have been shown in Fig. 6 (a). Fig. 6(a) shows that all samples are showing pseudo first order kinetics for the degradation of MB dye under UV–visible light irradiation. The values of k are found out to be 0.063min−1, 0.070min−1 0.077min−1 and 0.012min−1 for S#RT, S#200, S#400 and S#600 samples, respectively. Fig. 6(b) shows the comparison of dye degradation efficiencies (η in%) for all samples and it can be seen that S#400 sample shows the highest value of 83% in 20min only, whereas, S#600 shows the lowest degradation efficiency of 20% under the same experimental conditions. The reason behind this high photo-catalytic efficiency of S #400 samples is presence of a large amount of Zni , extended-Zni and oxygen defect states, as confirmed by PL measurement, as discussed earlier. Moreover, the photo-generated holes trapped by surface defects are ready to react with electron donors and the photocatalytic reaction can be greatly stimulated. 3.5.1 Effect of initial dye concentration The effect of initial concentration of dye on its degradation has been studied with varying concentration of dye from 10 to 40mg/L, keeping the catalyst (viz. S#400 sample) concentration fixed at 12mg/L. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). It is found that the degradation efficiency of S#400 samples has been increased initially for dye concentration up to 20mg/L. However, on increasing further the dye concentration, the degradation efficiency is decreased, which can be seen from Fig. 7(b). Saikia et al. recently found similar trends with ZnO nanostructures [38]. At higher dye concentration more dye molecules are adsorbed on ZnO surface, causing reduced exposure of the defect states to O2 molecules, thus dye degradation efficiency is decreased [38]. 3.5.2 Photo-catalytic degradation mechanism The ZnO based photo-catalytic oxidation mechanism in water solution has been discussed here. In the following we have presented the degradation mechanism of MB dye in the presence of catalyst. MB dye is a nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) containing aromatic compound (C16H18N3SCl). The photo-catalytic activity is started when the photon is incident on the catalyst surface. It can create an e-h pair i.e. excitons in ZnO photocatalyst [39]. Mainly two oxidative agents are considering here which are h+ (photo-induced hole) and OH radicals. This electron hole pair produces some intermediates products like, HOO. and H2O2 which finally produced the OH radicals in the presence of dissolved O2 [40]. This OH radicals are very strong oxidizing agent which can break the aromatic rings of the dye molecules and h + are mainly involved in decarboxylation reaction [41] (Photo-Kolbe reaction) and produced CO2. The possible oxidation mechanism is given below, (10) H 2 O ↔ ( H + + O H − ) + h + → H + + O H . (10.a) Z n O + h v → h + + e − . (10.b) O 2 + e − → O 2 • − . (10.c) O 2 • − + e − + 2 H + → H 2 O 2 . (10.d) H 2 O 2 + e − → O H − + O H • . (10.e) O H • + M B → C O 2 + H 2 O + S O 4 2 − + N H 2 − . The pathways of degradation of MB dye have also been shown in Fig. 8 . In the presence of UV–vis light irradiation the OH radicals first attack the CS+ C group with central aromatic ring of MB dye. The sulfoxide group are polar functional group and it can react with second OH radicals which produce sulfone and this sulfone finally separate the benzene rings [40]. Again sulfone group attached with the OH radical and produce sulfonic acid and finally produces SO4 2− ions. This SO4 2− ion reacts with OH radical and produces phenolic compound and H+ radical. However, the central aromatic ring is open due to the conversion from CS+ C to CS (O)C and two amino groups are converted into (-NH2 ) group due to the attack of OH radicals. The origin of H+ atoms is necessary for CH and NH bond formation and that can be formed by photo-generated electrons. Sulfonic acid and hydrated amino group further react with OH radicals and is finally converted into phenol, CO2, SO4 2− , NH2 − etc. [39–42]. Zinc interstitials (Zni, Zni +, Zni ++ ) and oxygen vacancies (Vo +, Vo ++ ) related defects have played important roles in the formation of OH. radical which has helped to degrade the MB dye in the presence of UV–vis light. The variation of the defects in the samples can be assessed from the observation of PL emission spectra. It has been found that S#400 samples shows the highest PL emission intensity confirming the presence of a large amount of defects in the sample. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, in this work we have demonstrated the tuning of defects by simple thermal annealing technique in as-synthesized EG capped ZnO nanostructures. It has been observed that, characteristics of different zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancy related PL emissions as well as the shape of the sample have been changed with the annealing temperatures. By increasing the annealing temperature from 200°C to 600°C, the shape of the synthesized materials has been changed from rod like to nearly spherical. The lattice strain present in the samples has been determined by using the Williamson – Hall (W-H) analyses of XRD data and a 2 fold increase in lattice strain is observed in 400°C annealed sample in comparison with that of as-synthesized sample. To study the influence of defects on photo-catalytic properties of the samples the degradation of a test dye, namely MB, under UV–vis light irradiation, has been carried out and the reaction kinetics has been determined by Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. It is found that there is a need of appropriate calcination temperature, in our case it is 400°C, at which ZnO maintained a quasi-spherical structure with tensile strain and large amount of defects which is favourable to improve the photo-catalytic degradation efficiency. At this annealing temperature, ZnO has exhibited more than 83% degradation efficiency within 20min only. The successful tuning of high defect states in 400°C annealed sample, as confirmed by PL measurement, has played an important role to achieve the high photo-catalytic activity in the samples. The photo-generated holes are trapped by surface defects which react with electron donors and the photocatalytic reaction can be greatly enhanced. The simple annealing technique at an optimum temperature induces large amount of zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies on ZnO materials and that can be utilized as an effective photo-catalyst for the complete photodegradation of various organic dyes and is helpful for the management of industrial waste water.
